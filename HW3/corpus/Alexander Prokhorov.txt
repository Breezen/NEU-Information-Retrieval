alexander mikhailovich prokhorov born alexander michael prochoroff russian алекса́ндр миха́йлович про́хоров 11 july 1916 – 8 january 2002 was an australian born russian physicist known for his pioneering research on lasers and masers for which he shared the nobel prize in physics in 1964 with charles hard townes and nikolay basov


 early life 
prokhorov alexander michael prochoroff on birth certificate was born in 1916 at russell road peeramon queensland australia now 322 gadaloff road butchers creek situated about 30 km from atherton to michael jant and mary prochoroff russian revolutionaries who had emigrated from russia to escape repression by the tsarist government as a child he attended butchers creek school in 1923 after the october revolution the family returned to russia in 1934 prokhorov entered the saint petersburg state university to study physics he graduated with honors in 1939 and moved to moscow to work at the lebedev physical institute in the oscillations laboratory headed by academician n d papaleksi his research there was devoted to propagation of radio waves in the ionosphere at the onset of world war ii in the soviet union in june 1941 he joined the red army during world war ii prokhorov fought in the infantry was wounded twice in battles and was awarded three medals including the medal for courage in 1946 he was demobilized in 1944 and returned to the lebedev institute where in 1946 he defended his phd thesis on theory of stabilization of frequency of a tube oscillator in the theory of a small parameter


 research 
in 1947 prokhorov started working on coherent radiation emitted by electrons orbiting in a cyclic particle accelerator called a synchrotron he demonstrated that the emission is mostly concentrated in the microwave spectral range his results became the basis of his habilitation on coherent radiation of electrons in the synchrotron accelerator defended in 1951 by 1950 prokhorov was assistant chief of the oscillation laboratory around that time he formed a group of young scientists to work on radiospectroscopy of molecular rotations and vibrations and later on quantum electronics the group focused on a special class of molecules which have three non-degenerate moments of inertia the research was conducted both on experiment and theory in 1954 prokhorov became head of the laboratory together with nikolay basov he developed theoretical grounds for creation of a molecular oscillator and constructed such an oscillator based on ammonia they also proposed a method for the production of population inversion using inhomogeneous electric and magnetic fields their results were first presented at a national conference in 1952 but not published until 1954–1955
in 1955 prokhorov started his research in the field of electron paramagnetic resonance epr he focused on relaxation times of ions of the iron group elements in a lattice of aluminium oxide but also investigated other non-optical topics such as magnetic phase transitions in dpph in 1957 while studying ruby a chromium-doped variation of aluminium oxide he came upon the idea of using this material as an active medium of a laser as a new type of laser resonator he proposed in 1958 an open type cavity design which is widely used today in 1963 together with a s selivanenko he suggested a laser using two-quantum transitions for his pioneering work on lasers and masers in 1964 he received the nobel prize in physics shared with nikolay basov and charles hard townes


 posts and awards 
in 1959 prokhorov became a professor at moscow state university – the most prestigious university in the soviet union the same year he was awarded the lenin prize in 1960 he became a member of the russian academy of sciences and elected academician in 1966 in 1967 he was awarded his first order of lenin he received five of them during life in 1967 1969 1975 1981 and 1986 in 1968 he became vice-director of the lebedev institute and in 1971 took the position of head of laboratory of another prestigious soviet institution the moscow institute of physics and technology in the same year he was elected a member of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1983 he was elected a member of the german academy of sciences leopoldina between 1982 and 1998 prokhorov served as acting director of the general physics institute of the russian academy of sciences and after 1998 as honorary director after his death in 2002 the institute was renamed the a m prokhorov general physics institute of the russian academy of sciences prokhorov was a member and one of the honorary presidents of the international academy of science munich and supported 1993 the foundation and development of the russian section of international academy of science moscow
in 1969 prokhorov became a hero of socialist labour the highest degree of distinction in the soviet union for achievements in national economy and culture he received the second such award in 1986 starting in 1969 he was the chief editor of the great soviet encyclopedia he was awarded the frederic ives medal the highest distinction of the optical society of america osa in 2000 and became an honorary osa member in 2001 the same year he was awarded the demidov prize


 politics 
prokhorov became a member of the communist party in 1950 in 1983 together with three other academicians – andrey tychonoff anatoly dorodnitsyn and georgy skryabin – he signed the famous open letter denouncing andrey sakharovs article in the foreign affairs


 family 
both of prokhorovs parents died during world war ii prokhorov married geographer galina shelepina in 1941 and they had a son kiril born in 1945 following his father kiril prokhorov became a physicist in the field of optics and is currently leading a laser-related laboratory at the a m prokhorov general physics institute
