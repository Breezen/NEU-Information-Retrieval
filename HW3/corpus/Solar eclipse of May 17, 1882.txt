 observations 
a party of observers gathered in egypt to watch the eclipse were greatly surprised when they observed a bright streak near to the sun once totality began by a remarkable coincidence the eclipse had coincided with the perihelion passage of a kreutz comet the comet would otherwise have gone unnoticed â€” its sighting during the eclipse was the only observation of it photographs of the eclipse revealed that the comet had moved noticeably during the 1m50s eclipse as would be expected for a comet racing past the sun at almost 500 kms the comet is sometimes referred to as tewfik after tewfik pasha the khedive of egypt at the time
