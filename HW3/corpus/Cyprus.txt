cyprus officially the republic of cyprus is an island country in the eastern mediterranean and the third largest and third most populous island in the mediterranean cyprus is located south of turkey west of syria and lebanon northwest of israel north of egypt and southeast of greece
the earliest known human activity on the island dates to around the 10th millennium bc archaeological remains from this period include the well-preserved neolithic village of khirokitia and cyprus is home to some of the oldest water wells in the world cyprus was settled by mycenaean greeks in two waves in the 2nd millennium bc as a strategic location in the middle east it was subsequently occupied by several major powers including the empires of the assyrians egyptians and persians from whom the island was seized in 333 bc by alexander the great subsequent rule by ptolemaic egypt the classical and eastern roman empire arab caliphates for a short period the french lusignan dynasty and the venetians was followed by over three centuries of ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 de jure until 1914
cyprus was placed under british administration based on the cyprus convention in 1878 and was formally annexed by britain in 1914 while turkish cypriots made up 18% of the population the partition of cyprus and creation of a turkish state in the north became a policy of turkish cypriot leaders and turkey in the 1950s turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of cyprus to turkey as cyprus was considered an extension of anatolia by them while since the 19th century the majority greek cypriot population and its orthodox church had been pursuing union with greece which became a greek national policy in the 1950s following nationalist violence in the 1950s cyprus was granted independence in 1960 in 1963 the 11-year intercommunal violence between greek cypriots and turkish cypriots started which displaced more than 25,000 turkish cypriots and brought the end of turkish cypriot representation in the republic on 15 july 1974 a coup d√©tat was staged by greek cypriot nationalists and elements of the greek military junta in an attempt at enosis the incorporation of cyprus into greece this action precipitated the turkish invasion of cyprus on 20 july which led to the capture of the present-day territory of northern cyprus in the following month after a ceasefire collapsed and the displacement of over 150,000 greek cypriots and 50,000 turkish cypriots a separate turkish cypriot state in the north was established by unilateral declaration in 1983 the move was widely condemned by the international community with turkey alone recognizing the new state these events and the resulting political situation are matters of a continuing dispute
the republic of cyprus has de jure sovereignty over the entire island including its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone with the exception of the sovereign base areas of akrotiri and dhekelia which remain under british control according to the london and z√ºrich agreements however the republic of cyprus is de facto partitioned into two main parts the area under the effective control of the republic located in the south and west and comprising about 59% of the islands area and the north administered by the self-declared turkish republic of northern cyprus covering about 36% of the islands area another nearly 4% of the islands area is covered by the un buffer zone the international community considers the northern part of the island as territory of the republic of cyprus occupied by turkish forces the occupation is viewed as illegal under international law amounting to illegal occupation of eu territory since cyprus became a member of the european union
cyprus is a major tourist destination in the mediterranean with an advanced high-income economy and a very high human development index the republic of cyprus has been a member of the commonwealth since 1961 and was a founding member of the non-aligned movement until it joined the european union on 1 may 2004 on 1 january 2008 the republic of cyprus joined the eurozone

 history 


 prehistoric and ancient cyprus 

the earliest confirmed site of human activity on cyprus is aetokremnos situated on the south coast indicating that hunter-gatherers were active on the island from around 10,000 bc with settled village communities dating from 8200 bc the arrival of the first humans correlates with the extinction of the dwarf hippos and dwarf elephants water wells discovered by archaeologists in western cyprus are believed to be among the oldest in the world dated at 9,000 to 10,500 years old
remains of an 8-month-old cat were discovered buried with a human body at a separate neolithic site in cyprus the grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old 7500 bc predating ancient egyptian civilisation and pushing back the earliest known feline-human association significantly the remarkably well-preserved neolithic village of khirokitia is a unesco world heritage site dating to approximately 6800 bc

during the late bronze age the island experienced two waves of greek settlement the first wave consisted of mycenaean greek traders who started visiting cyprus around 1400 bc a major wave of greek settlement is believed to have taken place following the bronze age collapse of mycenaean greece from 1100 to 1050 bc with the islands predominantly greek character dating from this period cyprus occupies an important role in greek mythology being the birthplace of aphrodite and adonis and home to king cinyras teucer and pygmalion beginning in the 8th century bc phoenician colonies were founded on the south coast of cyprus near present-day larnaca and salamis
cyprus is at a strategic location in the middle east it was ruled by assyria for a century starting in 708 bc before a brief spell under egyptian rule and eventually persian rule in 545 bc the cypriots led by onesilus king of salamis joined their fellow greeks in the ionian cities during the unsuccessful ionian revolt in 499 bc against the achaemenid empire the revolt was suppressed but cyprus managed to maintain a high degree of autonomy and remained oriented towards the greek world
the island was conquered by alexander the great in 333 bc following his death and the subsequent division of his empire and wars among his successors cyprus became part of the hellenistic empire of ptolemaic egypt it was during this period that the island was fully hellenized in 58 bc cyprus was acquired by the roman republic


 middle ages 

when the roman empire was divided into eastern and western parts in 395 cyprus became part of the east roman or byzantine empire and would remain so until the crusades some 800 years later under byzantine rule the greek orientation that had been prominent since antiquity developed the strong hellenistic-christian character that continues to be a hallmark of the greek cypriot community
beginning in 649 cyprus suffered from devastating raids launched by muslim armies from the levant which continued for the next 300 years many were quick piratical raids but others were large-scale attacks in which many cypriots were slaughtered and great wealth carried off or destroyed
there are no byzantine churches which survive from this period thousands of people were killed and many cities ‚Äì such as salamis ‚Äì were destroyed and never rebuilt byzantine rule was restored in 965 when emperor nikephoros ii phokas scored decisive victories on land and sea
in 1191 during the third crusade richard i of england captured the island from isaac komnenos of cyprus he used it as a major supply base that was relatively safe from the saracens a year later richard sold the island to the knights templar who following a bloody revolt in turn sold it to guy of lusignan his brother and successor aimery was recognised as king of cyprus by henry vi holy roman emperor
following the death in 1473 of james ii the last lusignan king the republic of venice assumed control of the island while the late kings venetian widow queen catherine cornaro reigned as figurehead venice formally annexed the kingdom of cyprus in 1489 following the abdication of catherine the venetians fortified nicosia by building the walls of nicosia and used it as an important commercial hub throughout venetian rule the ottoman empire frequently raided cyprus in 1539 the ottomans destroyed limassol and so fearing the worst the venetians also fortified famagusta and kyrenia
although the lusignan french aristocracy remained the dominant social class in cyprus throughout the medieval period the former assumption that greeks were treated only as serfs on the island is no longer considered by academics to be accurate it is now accepted that the medieval period saw increasing numbers of greek cypriots elevated to the upper classes a growing greek middle ranks and the lusignan royal household even marrying greeks this included king john ii of cyprus who married helena palaiologina


 cyprus under the ottoman empire 

in 1570 a full-scale ottoman assault with 60,000 troops brought the island under ottoman control despite stiff resistance by the inhabitants of nicosia and famagusta ottoman forces capturing cyprus massacred many greek and armenian christian inhabitants the previous latin elite were destroyed and the first significant demographic change since antiquity took place with the formation of a muslim community soldiers who fought in the conquest settled on the island and turkish peasants and craftsmen were brought to the island from anatolia this new community also included banished anatolian tribes undesirable persons and members of various troublesome muslim sects as well as a number of new converts on the island

the ottomans abolished the feudal system previously in place and applied the millet system to cyprus under which non-muslim peoples were governed by their own religious authorities in a reversal from the days of latin rule the head of the church of cyprus was invested as leader of the greek cypriot population and acted as mediator between christian greek cypriots and the ottoman authorities this status ensured that the church of cyprus was in a position to end the constant encroachments of the roman catholic church ottoman rule of cyprus was at times indifferent at times oppressive depending on the temperaments of the sultans and local officials and the island began over 250 years of economic decline
the ratio of muslims to christians fluctuated throughout the period of ottoman domination in 1777‚Äì78 47,000 muslims constituted a majority over the islands 37,000 christians by 1872 the population of the island had risen to 144,000 comprising 44,000 muslims and 100,000 christians the muslim population included numerous crypto-christians including the linobambaki a crypto-catholic community that arose due to religious persecution of the catholic community by the ottoman authorities this community would assimilate into the turkish cypriot community during british rule
as soon as the greek war of independence broke out in 1821 several greek cypriots left for greece to join the greek forces in response the ottoman governor of cyprus arrested and executed 486 prominent greek cypriots including the archbishop of cyprus kyprianos and four other bishops in 1828 modern greeces first president ioannis kapodistrias called for union of cyprus with greece and numerous minor uprisings took place reaction to ottoman misrule led to uprisings by both greek and turkish cypriots although none were successful after centuries of neglect by the turks the unrelenting poverty of most of the people and the ever-present tax collectors fuelled greek nationalism and by the 20th century idea of enosis or union with newly independent greece was firmly rooted among greek cypriots


 numeracy 
under the ottoman rule numeracy school enrollment and literacy rates were all low in some countries these low levels of human capital level persisted sometime after ottoman rule ended greece and cyprus were no exception they faced the same issue of paths taken under ottoman educational policies in these two countries greece and cyprus numeracy increased rapidly during the twentieth century


 cyprus under the british empire 

in the aftermath of the russo-turkish war 1877‚Äì1878 and the congress of berlin cyprus was leased to the british empire which de facto took over its administration in 1878 though in terms of sovereignty cyprus remained a de jure ottoman territory until 5 november 1914 together with egypt and sudan in exchange for guarantees that britain would use the island as a base to protect the ottoman empire against possible russian aggression

the island would serve britain as a key military base for its colonial routes by 1906 when the famagusta harbour was completed cyprus was a strategic naval outpost overlooking the suez canal the crucial main route to india which was then britains most important overseas possession following the outbreak of the first world war and the decision of the ottoman empire to join the war on the side of the central powers on 5 november 1914 the british empire formally annexed cyprus and declared the ottoman khedivate of egypt and sudan a sultanate and british protectorate
in 1915 britain offered cyprus to greece ruled by king constantine i of greece on condition that greece join the war on the side of the british the offer was declined in 1923 under the treaty of lausanne the nascent turkish republic relinquished any claim to cyprus and in 1925 it was declared a british crown colony many greek and turkish cypriots fought in the british army during both world wars during the second world war many enlisted in the cyprus regiment
the greek cypriot population meanwhile had become hopeful that the british administration would lead to enosis the idea of enosis was historically part of the megali idea a greater political ambition of a greek state encompassing the territories with greek inhabitants in the former ottoman empire including cyprus and asia minor with a capital in constantinople and was actively pursued by the cypriot orthodox church which had its members educated in greece these religious officials together with greek military officers and professionals some of whom still pursued the megali idea would later found the guerrilla organisation ethniki organosis kyprion agoniston or national organisation of cypriot fighters eoka the greek cypriots viewed the island as historically greek and believed that union with greece was a natural right in the 1950s the pursuit of enosis became a part of the greek national policy

initially the turkish cypriots favoured the continuation of the british rule however they were alarmed by the greek cypriot calls for enosis as they saw the union of crete with greece which led to the exodus of cretan turks as a precedent to be avoided and they took a pro-partition stance in response to the militant activity of eoka the turkish cypriots also viewed themselves as a distinct ethnic group of the island and believed in their having a separate right to self-determination from greek cypriots meanwhile in the 1950s turkish leader menderes considered cyprus an extension of anatolia rejected the partition of cyprus along ethnic lines and favoured the annexation of the whole island to turkey nationalistic slogans centred on the idea that cyprus is turkish and the ruling party declared cyprus to be a part of the turkish homeland that was vital to its security upon realising the fact that the turkish cypriot population was only 20% of the islanders made annexation unfeasible the national policy was changed to favour partition the slogan partition or death was frequently used in turkish cypriot and turkish protests starting in the late 1950s and continuing throughout the 1960s although after the z√ºrich and london conferences turkey seemed to accept the existence of the cypriot state and to distance itself from its policy of favouring the partition of the island the goal of the turkish and turkish cypriot leaders remained that of creating an independent turkish state in the northern part of the island
in january 1950 the church of cyprus organised a referendum under the supervision of clerics and with no turkish cypriot participation where 96% of the participating greek cypriots voted in favour of enosis the greeks were 80.2% of the total island s population at the time census 1946 restricted autonomy under a constitution was proposed by the british administration but eventually rejected in 1955 the eoka organisation was founded seeking union with greece through armed struggle at the same time the turkish resistance organisation tmt calling for taksim or partition was established by the turkish cypriots as a counterweight the british had also adopted at the time a policy of divide and rule woodhouse a british official in cyprus revealed that then british foreign secretary harold macmillan urged the britons in cyprus to stir up the turks in order to neutralise greek agitation british officials also tolerated the creation of the turkish underground organisation tmt the secretary of state for the colonies in a letter dated 15 july 1958 had advised the governor of cyprus not to act against tmt despite its illegal actions so as not to harm british relations with the turkish government


 independence and inter-communal violence 

on 16 august 1960 cyprus attained independence after the z√ºrich and london agreement between the united kingdom greece and turkey cyprus had a total population of 573,566 of whom 442,138 77.1 were greeks 104,320 18.2 turks and 27,108 4.7 others the uk retained the two sovereign base areas of akrotiri and dhekelia while government posts and public offices were allocated by ethnic quotas giving the minority turkish cypriots a permanent veto 30% in parliament and administration and granting the three mother-states guarantor rights
however the division of power as foreseen by the constitution soon resulted in legal impasses and discontent on both sides and nationalist militants started training again with the military support of greece and turkey respectively the greek cypriot leadership believed that the rights given to turkish cypriots under the 1960 constitution were too extensive and designed the akritas plan which was aimed at reforming the constitution in favour of greek cypriots persuading the international community about the correctness of the changes and violently subjugating turkish cypriots in a few days should they not accept the plan tensions were heightened when cypriot president archbishop makarios iii called for constitutional changes which were rejected by turkey and opposed by turkish cypriots
intercommunal violence erupted on 21 december 1963 when two turkish cypriots were killed at an incident involving the greek cypriot police the violence resulted in the death of 364 turkish and 174 greek cypriots destruction of 109 turkish cypriot or mixed villages and displacement of 25,000‚Äì30,000 turkish cypriots the crisis resulted in the end of the turkish cypriot involvement in the administration and their claiming that it had lost its legitimacy the nature of this event is still controversial in some areas greek cypriots prevented turkish cypriots from travelling and entering government buildings while some turkish cypriots willingly withdrew due to the calls of the turkish cypriot administration turkish cypriots started living in enclaves the republics structure was changed unilaterally by makarios and nicosia was divided by the green line with the deployment of unficyp troops
in 1964 turkey threatened to invade cyprus in response to the continuing cypriot intercommunal violence but this was stopped by a strongly worded telegram from the us president lyndon b johnson on 5 june warning that the us would not stand beside turkey in case of a consequential soviet invasion of turkish territory meanwhile by 1964 enosis was a greek policy that could not be abandoned makarios and the greek prime minister georgios papandreou agreed that enosis should be the ultimate aim and king constantine wished cyprus a speedy union with the mother country greece dispatched 10,000 troops to cyprus to counter a possible turkish invasion


 1974 coup turkish invasion and division 

on 15 july 1974 the greek military junta under dimitrios ioannides carried out a coup d√©tat in cyprus to unite the island with greece the coup ousted president makarios iii and replaced him with pro-enosis nationalist nikos sampson in response to the coup five days later on 20 july 1974 the turkish army invaded the island citing a right to intervene to restore the constitutional order from the 1960 treaty of guarantee this justification has been rejected by the united nations and the international community
the turkish air force began bombing greek positions in cyprus and hundreds of paratroopers were dropped in the area between nicosia and kyrenia where well-armed turkish cypriot enclaves had been long-established while off the kyrenia coast turkish troop ships landed 6,000 men as well as tanks trucks and armoured vehicles
three days later when a ceasefire had been agreed turkey had landed 30,000 troops on the island and captured kyrenia the corridor linking kyrenia to nicosia and the turkish cypriot quarter of nicosia itself the junta in athens and then the sampson regime in cyprus fell from power in nicosia glafkos clerides assumed the presidency and constitutional order was restored removing the pretext for the turkish invasion but after the peace negotiations in geneva the turkish government reinforced their kyrenia bridgehead and started a second invasion on 14 august the invasion resulted in the seizure of morphou karpass famagusta and the mesaoria
international pressure led to a ceasefire and by then 36% of the island had been taken over by the turks and 180,000 greek cypriots had been evicted from their homes in the north at the same time around 50,000 turkish cypriots moved to the areas under the control of the turkish forces and settled in the properties of the displaced greek cypriots among a variety of sanctions against turkey in mid-1975 the us congress imposed an arms embargo on turkey for using american-supplied equipment during the turkish invasion of cyprus in 1974 there are 1,534 greek cypriots and 502 turkish cypriots missing as a result of the fighting


 post-division 

after the restoration of constitutional order and the return of archbishop makarios iii to cyprus in december 1974 turkish troops remained occupying the northeastern portion of the island in 1983 the turkish cypriot leader proclaimed the turkish republic of northern cyprus trnc which is recognised only by turkey
the events of the summer of 1974 dominate the politics on the island as well as greco-turkish relations around 150,000 settlers from turkey are believed to be living in the north‚Äîmany of whom were forced from turkey by the turkish government‚Äîin violation of the geneva convention and various un resolutions

the turkish invasion the ensuing occupation and the declaration of independence by the trnc have been condemned by united nations resolutions which are reaffirmed by the security council every year the last major effort to settle the cyprus dispute was the annan plan in 2004 drafted by the then secretary general kofi annan the plan was put to a referendum in both northern cyprus and the republic of cyprus 65% of turkish cypriots voted in support of the plan and 74% greek cypriots voted against the plan claiming that it disproportionately favoured the turkish side in total 66.7% of the voters rejected the annan plan v on 1 may 2004 cyprus joined the european union together with nine other countries cyprus was accepted into the eu as a whole although the eu legislation is suspended in northern cyprus until a final settlement of the cyprus problem in july 2006 the island served as a haven for people fleeing lebanon due to the conflict between israel and hezbollah also called the july war
efforts have been made to enhance freedom of movement between the two sides in april 2003 northern cyprus unilaterally eased border restrictions permitting cypriots to cross between the two sides for the first time in 30 years in march 2008 a wall that had stood for decades at the boundary between the republic of cyprus and the un buffer zone was demolished the wall had cut across ledra street in the heart of nicosia and was seen as a strong symbol of the islands 32-year division on 3 april 2008 ledra street was reopened in the presence of greek and turkish cypriot officials north and south relaunched reunification talks on 15 may 2015


 geography 

cyprus is the third largest island in the mediterranean sea after the italian islands of sicily and sardinia both in terms of area and population it is also the worlds 80th largest by area and worlds 51st largest by population it measures 240 kilometres 149 mi long from end to end and 100 kilometres 62 mi wide at its widest point with turkey 75 kilometres 47 mi to the north it lies between latitudes 34¬∞ and 36¬∞ n and longitudes 32¬∞ and 35¬∞ e

 water supply 

cyprus suffers from a chronic shortage of water the country relies heavily on rain to provide household water but in the past 30 years average yearly precipitation has decreased between 2001 and 2004 exceptionally heavy annual rainfall pushed water reserves up with supply exceeding demand allowing total storage in the islands reservoirs to rise to an all-time high by the start of 2005 however since then demand has increased annually ‚Äì a result of local population growth foreigners moving to cyprus and the number of visiting tourists ‚Äì while supply has fallen as a result of more frequent droughts
dams remain the principal source of water both for domestic and agricultural use cyprus has a total of 107 dams plus one currently under construction and reservoirs with a total water storage capacity of about 330,000,000 m3 1.2√ó1010 cu ft water desalination plants are gradually being constructed to deal with recent years of prolonged drought the government has invested heavily in the creation of water desalination plants which have supplied almost 50 per cent of domestic water since 2001 efforts have also been made to raise public awareness of the situation and to encourage domestic water users to take more responsibility for the conservation of this increasingly scarce commodity
turkey is building a water pipeline under the mediterranean sea from anamur on its southern coast to the northern coast of cyprus to supply northern cyprus with potable and irrigation water see northern cyprus water supply project


 politics 

cyprus is a presidential republic the head of state and of the government is elected by a process of universal suffrage for a five-year term executive power is exercised by the government with legislative power vested in the house of representatives whilst the judiciary is independent of both the executive and the legislature
the 1960 constitution provided for a presidential system of government with independent executive legislative and judicial branches as well as a complex system of checks and balances including a weighted power-sharing ratio designed to protect the interests of the turkish cypriots the executive was led by a greek cypriot president and a turkish cypriot vice-president elected by their respective communities for five-year terms and each possessing a right of veto over certain types of legislation and executive decisions legislative power rested on the house of representatives who were also elected on the basis of separate voters rolls
since 1965 following clashes between the two communities the turkish cypriot seats in the house remain vacant in 1974 cyprus was divided de facto when the turkish army occupied the northern third of the island the turkish cypriots subsequently declared independence in 1983 as the turkish republic of northern cyprus but were recognised only by turkey in 1985 the trnc adopted a constitution and held its first elections the united nations recognises the sovereignty of the republic of cyprus over the entire island of cyprus
the house of representatives currently has 59 members elected for a five-year term 56 members by proportional representation and 3 observer members representing the armenian latin and maronite minorities 24 seats are allocated to the turkish community but remain vacant since 1964 the political environment is dominated by the communist akel the liberal conservative democratic rally the centrist democratic party the social-democratic edek and the centrist euroko in 2008 dimitris christofias became the countrys first communist head of state due to his involvement in the 2012‚Äì13 cypriot financial crisis christofias did not run for re-election in 2013 the presidential election in 2013 resulted in democratic rally candidate nicos anastasiades winning 57.48% of the vote as a result anastasiades was sworn in on and has been president since 28 february 2013 anastasiades was re-elected with 56% of the vote in the 2018 presidential election


 administrative divisions 

the republic of cyprus is divided into six districts nicosia famagusta kyrenia larnaca limassol and paphos


 exclaves and enclaves 

cyprus has four exclaves all in territory that belongs to the british sovereign base area of dhekelia the first two are the villages of ormidhia and xylotymvou the third is the dhekelia power station which is divided by a british road into two parts the northern part is the eac refugee settlement the southern part even though located by the sea is also an exclave because it has no territorial waters of its own those being uk waters
