sir joseph austen chamberlain kg 16 october 1863 – 17 march 1937 was a british statesman son of joseph chamberlain and half-brother of neville chamberlain
he stood for the liberal unionist party which merged with the conservatives in 1912 and led the conservatives in the commons in 1921–22 as foreign secretary he negotiated the locarno pact 1925 aimed at preventing war between france and germany for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize he was one of the few mps supporting winston churchills appeals for rearmament against the german threat in the 1930s


 early life and career 
austen chamberlain was born in birmingham the second child and eldest son of joseph chamberlain then a rising industrialist and political radical later mayor of birmingham and a dominant figure in liberal and unionist politics at the end of the 19th century his mother the former harriet kenrick died in childbirth leaving his father so shaken that for almost 25 years he maintained a distance from his first-born son in 1868 his father married harriets cousin florence and had further children the oldest of whom arthur neville would become prime minister in the year of austens death
austen was educated first at rugby school before passing on to trinity college cambridge while at trinity college he became a lifelong friend of f s oliver a future advocate of imperial federation and after 1909 a prominent member of the round table movement chamberlain made his first political address in 1884 at a meeting of the universitys political society and was vice-president of the cambridge union society
it would seem that from an early age his father had intended for politics to be austens future path and with that in mind he was sent first to france where he studied at the paris institute of political studies and developed a lasting admiration for the french people and culture for nine months he was shown the brilliance of paris under the third republic and he met and dined with the likes of georges clemenceau and alexandre ribot
from paris austen was sent to berlin for twelve months to imbibe the political culture of the other great european power germany though in his letters home to beatrice and neville he showed an obvious preference for france and the lifestyle he had left behind there chamberlain undertook to learn german and learn from his experience in the capital of the second reich among others austen met and dined with the iron chancellor otto von bismarck an experience that was to hold a special place in his heart for the duration of his life
while attending the university of berlin austen developed a suspicion of the growing nationalism in germany based upon his experience of the lecturing style of heinrich von treitschke who opened up to him a new side of the german character - a narrow-minded proud intolerant prussian chauvinism the consequences of which he was later to ponder during the first world war and the crises of the 1930s
austen returned to england in 1888 lured largely by the prize of a parliamentary constituency he was first elected to parliament as a member of his fathers own liberal unionist party in 1892 sitting for the seat of east worcestershire owing to the prominence of his father and the alliance between the anti-home rule liberal unionists and conservatives chamberlain was returned unopposed on 30 march and at the first sitting of the new session he walked up the floor of the house flanked by his father and his uncle richard
owing to the dissolution of parliament and the 1892 general election that august chamberlain was unable to make his maiden speech until april 1893 but when delivered it was acclaimed by the four-time prime minister william ewart gladstone as one of the best speeches which has been made that chamberlain was speaking against gladstones own second home rule bill does not seem to have dampened the enthusiasm of the prime minister who responded by publicly congratulating both austen and his father joseph on such an excellent performance that was highly significant given the bad blood existing between joseph chamberlain and his former leader


 political office 

appointed a junior whip of the liberal unionists after the general election austens main role was to act as his fathers standard bearer in matters of policy following the conservative and unionist landslide win in the election of 1895 chamberlain was appointed civil lord of the admiralty holding that post until 1900 when he became financial secretary to the treasury lord salisbury retired as prime minister in july 1902 and the following month chamberlain was promoted to the position of postmaster general by the new premier the conservative arthur j balfour who also designated this a cabinet position and appointed him to the privy council
in the wake of the struggle between his father and balfour austen chamberlain became chancellor of the exchequer in 1903 austens appointment was largely a compromise solution to the bitter division of the two unionist heavyweights which threatened to split the coalition between supporters of chamberlains imperial tariff campaign and balfours more cautious advocacy of protectionism while austen supported his father’s programme his influence within the cabinet was diminished following the departure of the senior chamberlain to become backbenchers facing a resurgent liberal opposition and the threat of an internal party split balfour eventually took the unionists into opposition in december 1905 and in the ensuing rout in the election of 1906 austen found himself one of the few surviving liberal unionists in the house of commons
after his fathers stroke and enforced retirement from active politics a few months later austen became the effective leader of the tariff reform campaign within the unionist party and thus he was a contender for the eventual leadership of the party itself


 leadership questions 
with the unionists in disarray after electoral defeats at both the january and december 1910 elections balfour was forced from his position as party leader in november 1911 chamberlain was one of the leading candidates to succeed as conservative leader even though he was still technically a member of the liberal unionist wing of the coalition the two parties merged formally only in 1912
chamberlain was opposed by canadian-born bonar law walter long and irish unionist edward carson
given their standing in the party only chamberlain and long had a realistic chance of success and though balfour had intended chamberlain to succeed him it became clear from an early canvass of the sitting mps that long would be elected by a slender margin
after a short period of internal party campaigning chamberlain determined to withdraw from the contest for the good of the still-divided party he succeeded in persuading long to withdraw with him in favour of bonar law who was subsequently chosen by unanimous vote as a compromise candidate
chamberlains action while it prevented him from attaining the party leadership and arguably the premiership did a great deal to maintain unity within the conservative and liberal unionist parties at a time of great uncertainty and strain


 irish home rule 

in the last years before the outbreak of world war i chamberlain was concerned with one issue above all others home rule for ireland the issue that had prompted his father to leave the liberal party in the 1880s now threatened to spill over into outright civil war with the government of h h asquith committed to the passage of a third home rule bill chamberlain was resolutely opposed to the dissolution of the union with ireland to the strain then was added the death of his father in july 1914 only a few days after the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand of austria which began the train of events that led to the war


 first world war 
pressure from the conservative opposition in part led by chamberlain eventually resulted in the formation of the wartime coalition government in 1915 chamberlain joined the cabinet as secretary of state for india like other politicians including arthur balfour and george curzon chamberlain supported the invasion of mesopotamia to increase british prestige in the region thus discouraging a german-inspired muslim revolt in india
chamberlain remained at the india office after david lloyd george succeeded asquith as prime minister in late 1916 but following inquiries into the failure of the mesopotamian campaign undertaken by the separately-administered indian army in 1915 including the loss of the british garrison during the siege of kut chamberlain resigned his post in 1917 as the minister ultimately responsible the fault lay with him he was widely acclaimed for such a principled act
after lloyd georges paris speech 12 november 1917 at which he said that when he saw the appalling casualty lists he wished it had not been necessary to win so many victories there was talk of chamberlain withdrawing support from the government lloyd george survived by claiming that the aim of the new inter-allied supreme war council was purely to coordinate policy not to overrule the british generals who still enjoyed a good deal of support from conservatives
later he returned to government and became a member of the war cabinet in april 1918 as minister without portfolio replacing lord milner who had become secretary of state for war
following the victory of the lloyd george coalition in the 1918 general election chamberlain was again appointed to the position of chancellor of the exchequer in january 1919 and immediately faced the huge task of restoring britains finances after four years of wartime expenditure


 leadership 
citing ill health bonar law retired from the leadership of the conservative branch of the lloyd george government in the spring of 1921 his seniority and the general dislike of curzon his counterpart in the house of lords helped chamberlain to both succeed bonar law as leader of the house of commons and take over in the office of lord privy seal he was succeeded at the exchequer by sir robert horne it seemed that after ten years of waiting austen would again be given the opportunity of succeeding to the premiership
the lloyd george coalition was beginning to falter following numerous scandals and the unsuccessful conclusion of the anglo-irish war and it was widely believed that it would not survive until the next general election he had previously had little regard for lloyd george but the opportunity of working closely with the welsh wizard gave chamberlain a new insight into his nominal superior in the government by now the conservative party was by far the largest partner in the government
it was an unfortunate change of allegiance for chamberlain for by late 1921 the conservative backbenchers were growing more and more restless for an end to the coalition and a return to single-party conservative government conservatives in the house of lords began in public to oppose the coalition disregarding calls for support from chamberlain in the country at large conservative candidates began to oppose the coalition at by-elections and discontent spread to the house of commons
in the autumn of 1922 chamberlain faced a backbench revolt largely led by stanley baldwin designed to oust lloyd george and when he summoned the carlton club meeting 19 october 1922 of conservative mps a motion was there passed for fighting the forthcoming election as an independent party chamberlain resigned the party leadership rather than act against what he believed to be his duty he was succeeded by bonar law whose views and intentions he had predicted the evening before the vote at a private meeting bonar law formed a government shortly thereafter but chamberlain was not given a post but it seems that he would not have accepted a position even if he had been offered one
austen and neville chamberlain and iain duncan smith are the only three conservative leaders not to lead the party into a general election until william hague in 1997 austen was the only conservative leader in the 20th century not to become prime minister


 foreign secretary 

after the second resignation of bonar law in may 1923 law died from throat cancer later that year chamberlain was passed over again for the leadership of the party in favour of stanley baldwin baldwin offered chamberlain the post of lord privy seal but chamberlain insisted other former ministers from the coalition to be included as well baldwin refused however chamberlain returned to government when baldwin formed his second ministry following success in the election of october 1924 serving in the important office of secretary of state for foreign affairs from 1924 to 1929 chamberlain was largely allowed a free hand by the easy-going baldwin
it is as foreign secretary that chamberlains place in history was finally assured in a difficult period in international relations chamberlain faced not only a split in the entente cordiale by the french invasion of the ruhr but also the controversy over the 1924 geneva protocol which threatened to dilute british sovereignty over the issue of league of nations economic sanctions


 locarno pact 
despite the importance to history of other pressing issues his reputation chiefly rests on his part in the negotiations over what came to be known as the locarno pact of 1925 seeking to maintain the postwar status quo in the west chamberlain responded favourably to the approaches of german foreign minister gustav stresemann for a british guarantee of germanys western borders besides promoting franco-german reconciliation chamberlains main motive was to create a situation in which germany could pursue territorial revisionism in eastern europe peacefully
chamberlains understanding was that if franco-german relations improved france would gradually abandon the cordon sanitaire the french alliance system in eastern europe between the wars once france had abandoned its allies in eastern europe as the price of better relations with the reich the poles and czechoslovaks would have no great power ally to protect them would be forced to adjust to german demands chamberlain believed that they would peacefully hand over the territories claimed by germany such as the sudetenland the polish corridor and the free city of danzig promoting territorial revisionism in eastern europe in germanys favour was one of chamberlains principal reasons for locarno
together with aristide briand of france chamberlain and stresemann met at the town of locarno in october 1925 and signed a mutual agreement together with representatives from belgium and italy to settle all differences between the nations by arbitration not war for his services chamberlain was not only awarded the nobel peace prize but also made a knight of the order of the garter he was the first ordinary knight of the garter since elizabethan times sir henry lee to die without having been made a peer he was the 871st knight of the garter
chamberlain also secured britains accession to the kellogg-briand pact which theoretically outlawed war as an instrument of policy chamberlain infamously said that italian dictator benito mussolini was a man with whom business could be done


 later career 
following his less-satisfactory engagement in issues in the far east and egypt and the resignation of baldwin’s government after the election of 1929 chamberlain resigned his position as foreign secretary and went into retirement he briefly returned to government in 1931 as first lord of the admiralty in ramsay macdonalds first national government but soon retired later that year after having been forced to deal with the unfortunate invergordon mutiny
over the next six years as a senior backbencher he gave strong support to the national government on domestic issues but was critical on foreign policy in 1935 the government faced a parliamentary rebellion over the hoare-laval pact his opposition to the vote of censure is widely believed to have been instrumental in saving the government from defeat on the floor of the house
chamberlain was again briefly considered in 1935 for the post of foreign secretary but was passed over once the crisis was over for being too old for the job instead his advice was sought as to the suitability of his former parliamentary private secretary now minister for the league of nations anthony eden for the post


 calls for rearmament 
from 1934 to 1937 chamberlain was with winston churchill roger keyes and leo amery the most prominent voice calling for british rearmament in the face of a growing threat from nazi germany in addition to speaking eloquently in parliament on the matter he was the chairman of two conservative parliamentary delegations in late 1936 that met with prime minister stanley baldwin to remonstrate with him about his governments delay in rearming the british defence forces more respected than churchill chamberlain became something of an icon to young conservatives as the last survivor of the victorian high politics
though he never again served in a government he survived in good health until march 1937 dying just ten weeks before his younger half-brother neville became the first and only member of the chamberlain dynasty to become prime minister
chamberlain died at the age of 73 in his london home 24 egerton terrace on 16 march 1937 he is buried in east finchley cemetery in london
his estate was valued at probate at £45,044 a relatively modest sum for such a famous public figure much of his fathers fortune had been lost in an attempt to grow sisal in the west indies in the early 1890s and unlike neville he never went into business to make money for himself
his personal and political papers are housed in the cadbury research library at the university of birmingham


 personal life 
in 1906 chamberlain married ivy muriel dundas died 1941 daughter of colonel henry dundas they had two sons joseph and lawrence and a daughter diane during the 1920s chamberlain lived at a house called twytts ghyll in fir toll road mayfield east sussex he sold the house in 1929 rcg foster said he kept himself quite aloof from the village and was not popular with his neighbours he had an interest in rock gardening at his death his estate was valued for probate at £45,044 18/1
