the umbra penumbra and antumbra are three distinct parts of a shadow created by any light source after impinging on an opaque object for a point source only the umbra is cast
these names are most often used for the shadows cast by celestial bodies though they are sometimes used to describe levels of darkness such as in sunspots


 umbra 

the umbra latin for shadow is the innermost and darkest part of a shadow where the light source is completely blocked by the occluding body an observer in the umbra experiences a total eclipse the umbra of a round body occluding a round light source forms a right circular cone to a viewer at the cones apex the two bodies are equal in apparent size the distance from the moon to the apex of its umbra is roughly equal to that between the moon and earth because the earth is 3.70 times wider than the moon its umbra extends correspondingly farther roughly 1.4 million kilometers


 penumbra 

an outer partially dark region at the edges is called penumbra



 antumbra 
the antumbra from latin ante before is the region from which the occluding body appears entirely contained within the disc of the light source an observer in this region experiences an annular eclipse in which a bright ring is visible around the eclipsing body if the observer moves closer to the light source the apparent size of the occluding body increases until it causes a full umbra
