electron neutrinos are produced in the sun as a product of nuclear fusion solar neutrinos constitute by far the largest flux of neutrinos from natural sources observed on earth as compared with eg atmospheric neutrinos or the diffuse supernova neutrino background 


 production mechanisms 
solar neutrinos are produced in the core of the sun through various nuclear fusion reactions each of which occurs at a particular rate and leads to its own spectrum of neutrinos details of these reactions are listed below
the main contribution comes from the proton-proton reaction the reaction is

since there are four protons and only three neutrons the beryllium can go down two different paths from here the beryllium could capture an electron and produce a lithium-7 nucleus and an electron neutrino it can also capture a proton due to the abundance in a star this will create boron-8 both these reactions are seen respectively below

 observed data 

the highest flux of solar neutrinos come directly from the proton-proton interaction and have a low energy up to 400 kev as shown in fig 1 there are also several other significant production mechanisms with energies up to 18 mev from the earth the amount of neutrino flux at earth is around 7·1010 particles·cm−2·s −1 the number of neutrinos can be predicted by the standard solar model the detected number of electron neutrinos was only 1/3 of the predicted number and this was known as the solar neutrino problem it led to the idea of neutrino oscillation and the fact that neutrinos can change flavour this was confirmed when the total flux of solar neutrinos of all types was measured and it agreed with the earlier predictions of expected electron neutrino flux as seen by sudbury neutrino observatory and thus confirmed that neutrinos have mass solar models additionally predict the location within the suns core where solar neutrinos should originate from depending on the nuclear fusion reaction which leads to their production future neutrino detectors will be able to detect the incoming direction of these neutrinos with enough precision to measure this effect

the energy spectrum of solar neutrinos is also predicted by solar models it is essential to know this energy spectrum because different neutrino detection experiments are sensitive to different neutrino energy ranges the homestake experiment used chlorine and was most sensitive to solar neutrinos produced by the decay of the beryllium isotope 7be the sudbury neutrino observatory is most sensitive to solar neutrinos produced by 8b the detectors that use gallium are most sensitive to the solar neutrinos produced by the proton-proton chain reaction process however they were not able to observe this contribution separately the observation of the neutrinos from the basic reaction of this chain proton-proton fusion in deuterium was achieved for the first time by borexino in 2014 in 2012 the same collaboration reported detecting low-energy neutrinos for the proton-electron-proton pep reaction that produces 1 in 400 deuterium nuclei in the sun the detector contained 100 metric tons of liquid and saw on average 3 events each day due to carbon 11 production from this relatively uncommon thermonuclear reaction note that borexino measured neutrinos of several energies in this manner they have demonstrated experimentally for the first time the pattern of solar neutrino oscillations predicted by the theory neutrinos can trigger nuclear reactions by looking at ancient ores of various ages that have been exposed to solar neutrinos over geologic time it may be possible to interrogate the luminosity of the sun over time which according to the standard solar model has changed with time
