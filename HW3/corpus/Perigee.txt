an apsis greek ἁψίσ plural apsides  greek ἁψῖδεσ is an extreme point in an objects orbit the word comes via latin from greek and is cognate with apse for elliptic orbits about a larger body there are two apsides named with the prefixes peri- from περί peri meaning near and ap- or apo- from ἀπό apó meaning away from added to a reference to the thing being orbited
for a body orbiting the sun the point of least distance is the perihelion  and the point of greatest distance is the aphelion 
the terms become periastron and apastron when discussing orbits around other stars
for any satellite of earth including the moon the point of least distance is the perigee  and greatest distance the apogee
for objects in lunar orbit the point of least distance is the pericynthion  and the greatest distance the apocynthion  perilune and apolune are also used
for any orbit around a center of mass there are the terms periapsis and apoapsis or apapsis pericenter and apocenter are equivalent alternatives
a straight line connecting the periapsis and apoapsis is the line of apsides this is the major axis of the ellipse its greatest diameter for a two-body system the center of mass of the system lies on this line at one of the two foci of the ellipse when one body is sufficiently larger than the other it may be taken to be at this focus however whether or not this is the case both bodies are in similar elliptical orbits each having one focus at the systems center of mass with their respective lines of apsides being of length inversely proportional to their masses historically in geocentric systems apsides were measured from the center of the earth however in the case of the moon the center of mass of the earth–moon system or earth–moon barycenter as the common focus of both the moons and earths orbits about each other is about 75% of the way from earths center to its surface
in orbital mechanics the apsis technically refers to the distance measured between the centers of mass of the central and orbiting body however in the case of spacecraft the family of terms are commonly used to refer to the orbital altitude of the spacecraft from the surface of the central body assuming a constant standard reference radius

note that for conversion from heights above the surface to distances between an orbit and its primary the radius of the central body has to be added and conversely

 terminology 
the words pericenter and apocenter are often seen although periapsisapoapsis are preferred in technical usage
various related terms are used for other celestial objects the -gee -helion -astron and -galacticon forms are frequently used in the astronomical literature when referring to the earth sun stars and the galactic center respectively the suffix -jove is occasionally used for jupiter while -saturnium has very rarely been used in the last 50 years for saturn the -gee form is commonly used as a generic closest approach to planet term instead of specifically applying to the earth during the apollo program the terms pericynthion and apocynthion referencing cynthia an alternative name for the greek moon goddess artemis were used when referring to the moon regarding black holes the term periapomelasma from a greek root was used by physicist geoffrey a landis in 1998 before periaponigricon from latin appeared in the scientific literature in 2002 as well as periapobothron from greek bothros meaning hole or pit


 terminology summary 
the following suffixes are added to peri- and apo- to form the terms for the nearest and farthest orbital distances from these objects


 perihelion and aphelion of the earth 
for the orbit of the earth around the sun the time of apsis is often expressed in terms of a time relative to seasons since this determines the contribution of the elliptical orbit to seasonal variations the variation of the seasons is primarily controlled by the annual cycle of the elevation angle of the sun which is a result of the tilt of the axis of the earth measured from the plane of the ecliptic the earths eccentricity and other orbital elements are not constant but vary slowly due to the perturbing effects of the planets and other objects in the solar system see milankovitch cycles
on a very long time scale the dates of the perihelion and of the aphelion progress through the seasons and they make one complete cycle in 22,000 to 26,000 years there is a corresponding movement of the position of the stars as seen from earth that is called the apsidal precession this is closely related to the precession of the axis
currently the earth reaches perihelion in early january approximately 14 days after the december solstice at perihelion the earths center is about 0.98329 astronomical units au or 147,098,070 km 91,402,500 mi from the suns center
the earth reaches aphelion currently in early july approximately 14 days after the june solstice the aphelion distance between the earths and suns centers is currently about 1.01671 au or 152,097,700 km 94,509,100 mi
in the short term the dates of perihelion and aphelion can vary up to 2 days from one year to another this significant variation is due to the presence of the moon while the earth–moon barycenter is moving on a stable orbit around the sun the position of the earths center which is on average about 4,700 kilometres 2,900 mi from the barycenter could be shifted in any direction from it – and this affects the timing of the actual closest approach between the suns and the earths centers which in turn defines the timing of perihelion in a given year
astronomers commonly express the timing of perihelion relative to the vernal equinox not in terms of days and hours but rather as an angle of orbital displacement the so-called longitude of the periapsis also called longitude of the pericenter for the orbit of the earth this is called the longitude of perihelion and in 2000 it was about 282.895° by the year 2010 this had advanced by a small fraction of a degree to about 283.067°
the dates and times of the perihelions and aphelions for several past and future years are listed in the following table

the following table shows the distances of the planets and dwarf planets from the sun at their perihelion and aphelion
the following chart shows the range of distances of the planets dwarf planets and halleys comet from the sun
