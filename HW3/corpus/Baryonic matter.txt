in astronomy and cosmology baryonic dark matter is dark matter composed of baryons only a small proportion of the dark matter in the universe is likely to be baryonic


 characteristics 
as dark matter baryonic dark matter is undetectable by its emitted radiation but its presence can be inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter this form of dark matter is composed of baryons heavy subatomic particles such as protons and neutrons and combinations of these including non-emitting ordinary atoms


 presence 
baryonic dark matter may occur in non-luminous gas or in massive astrophysical compact halo objects machos - condensed objects such as black holes neutron stars white dwarfs very faint stars or non-luminous objects like planets and brown dwarfs


 estimates of quantity 
the total amount of baryonic dark matter can be inferred from models of big bang nucleosynthesis and observations of the cosmic microwave background both indicate that the amount of baryonic dark matter is much smaller than the total amount of dark matter


 big bang nucleosynthesis 
from the perspective of big bang nucleosynthesis a larger amount of ordinary baryonic matter implies a denser early universe more efficient conversion of matter to helium-4 and less unburned deuterium remaining if all of the dark matter in the universe were baryonic then would be much less deuterium in the universe than is observed this could be resolved if more deuterium were somehow generated but large efforts in the 1970s failed to identify plausible mechanisms for this to occur for instance machos which include for example brown dwarfs bodies of hydrogen and helium with masses less than 0.08 m☉ or 1.6×1029 kg never begin nuclear fusion of hydrogen but they do burn deuterium other possibilities that were examined include jupiters which are similar to brown dwarfs but have masses
