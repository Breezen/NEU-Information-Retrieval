the moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet earth being earths only permanent natural satellite it is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the solar system and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits its primary following jupiters satellite io the moon is the second-densest satellite in the solar system among those whose densities are known
the moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago not long after earth the most widely accepted explanation is that the moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between earth and a mars-sized body called theia
the moon is in synchronous rotation with earth always showing the same face with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters as seen from the earth it is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in earths sky after the sun its surface is actually dark although compared to the night sky it appears very bright with a reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt its gravitational influence produces the ocean tides body tides and the slight lengthening of the day
the moons average orbital distance at the present time is 384,402 km 238,856 mi or 1.28 light-seconds this is about thirty times the diameter of earth with its apparent size in the sky almost the same as that of the sun due to it being 400x farther and larger resulting in the moon covering the sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipse this matching of apparent visual size will not continue in the far future because the moons distance from earth is slowly increasing
the soviet unions luna program was the first to reach the moon with unmanned spacecraft in 1959 the united states nasa apollo program achieved the only manned missions to date beginning with the first manned lunar orbiting mission by apollo 8 in 1968 and six manned lunar landings between 1969 and 1972 with the first being apollo 11 these missions returned lunar rocks which have been used to develop a geological understanding of the moons origin internal structure and later history since the apollo 17 mission in 1972 the moon has been visited only by unmanned spacecraft
within human culture both the moons natural prominence in the earthly sky and its regular cycle of phases as seen from the earth have provided cultural references and influences for human societies and cultures since time immemorial such cultural influences can be found in language lunar based calendar systems art and mythology


 name and etymology 

the usual english proper name for earths natural satellite is the moon which in nonscientific texts is usually not capitalized the noun moon is derived from old english mōna which like all germanic language cognates stems from proto-germanic mēnô which comes from proto-indo-european mḗh₁n̥s moon month which comes from the proto-indo-european root meh₁- to measure the month being the ancient unit of time measured by the moon occasionally the name luna is used in literature especially science fiction luna is used to distinguish it from other moons while in poetry the name has been used to denote personification of our moon
the modern english adjective pertaining to the moon is lunar derived from the latin word for the moon luna the adjective selenic usually only used to refer to selenium is so rarely used to refer to the moon that this meaning is not recorded in most major dictionaries it is derived from the ancient greek word for the moon σελήνη selḗnē from which is however also derived the prefix seleno- as in selenography the study of the physical features of the moon both the greek goddess selene and the roman goddess diana were alternatively called cynthia the names luna cynthia and selene are reflected in terminology for lunar orbits in words such as apolune pericynthion and selenocentric the name diana comes from the proto-indo-european diw-yo heavenly which comes from the pie root dyeu- to shine which in many derivatives means sky heaven and god and is also the origin of latin dies day


 formation 

several mechanisms have been proposed for the moons formation 4.51 billion years ago and some 60 million years after the origin of the solar system these mechanisms included the fission of the moon from earths crust through centrifugal force which would require too great an initial spin of earth the gravitational capture of a pre-formed moon which would require an unfeasibly extended atmosphere of earth to dissipate the energy of the passing moon and the co-formation of earth and the moon together in the primordial accretion disk which does not explain the depletion of metals in the moon these hypotheses also cannot account for the high angular momentum of the earth–moon system

the prevailing hypothesis is that the earth–moon system formed as a result of the impact of a mars-sized body named theia with the proto-earth giant impact that blasted material into orbit about the earth that then accreted to form the present earth-moon system
the far side of the moon has a crust that is 30 mi 48 km thicker than the near side of the moon this is thought to be due to the moon having been amalgamated from two different bodies
this hypothesis although not perfect perhaps best explains the evidence eighteen months prior to an october 1984 conference on lunar origins bill hartmann roger phillips and jeff taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists you have eighteen months go back to your apollo data go back to your computer do whatever you have to but make up your mind dont come to our conference unless you have something to say about the moons birth at the 1984 conference at kona hawaii the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most popular

before the conference there were partisans of the three traditional theories plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn’t think the debate would ever be resolved afterward there were essentially only two groups the giant impact camp and the agnostics

giant impacts are thought to have been common in the early solar system computer simulations of a giant impact have produced results that are consistent with the mass of the lunar core and the present angular momentum of the earth–moon system these simulations also show that most of the moon derived from the impactor rather than the proto-earth more recent simulations suggest a larger fraction of the moon derived from the original earth mass studies of meteorites originating from inner solar system bodies such as mars and vesta show that they have very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions as compared to earth whereas earth and the moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions the isotopic equalization of the earth-moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two although this is debated
the great amount of energy released in the impact event and the subsequent re-accretion of that material into the earth-moon system would have melted the outer shell of earth forming a magma ocean similarly the newly formed moon would also have been affected and had its own lunar magma ocean estimates for its depth range from about 500 km 300 miles to its entire depth 1,737 km 1,079 miles
while the giant impact hypothesis might explain many lines of evidence there are still some unresolved questions most of which involve the moons composition

in 2001 a team at the carnegie institute of washington reported the most precise measurement of the isotopic signatures of lunar rocks to their surprise the team found that the rocks from the apollo program carried an isotopic signature that was identical with rocks from earth and were different from almost all other bodies in the solar system because most of the material that went into orbit to form the moon was thought to come from theia this observation was unexpected in 2007 researchers from the california institute of technology announced that there was less than a 1% chance that theia and earth had identical isotopic signatures published in 2012 an analysis of titanium isotopes in apollo lunar samples showed that the moon has the same composition as earth which conflicts with what is expected if the moon formed far from earths orbit or from theia variations on the giant impact hypothesis may explain this data


 physical characteristics 


 internal structure 

the moon is a differentiated body it has a geochemically distinct crust mantle and core the moon has a solid iron-rich inner core with a radius possibly as small as 240 km 150 mi and a fluid outer core primarily made of liquid iron with a radius of roughly 300 km 190 mi around the core is a partially molten boundary layer with a radius of about 500 km 310 mi this structure is thought to have developed through the fractional crystallization of a global magma ocean shortly after the moons formation 4.5 billion years ago crystallization of this magma ocean would have created a mafic mantle from the precipitation and sinking of the minerals olivine clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene after about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallised lower-density plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust atop the final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle with a high abundance of incompatible and heat-producing elements consistent with this perspective geochemical mapping made from orbit suggests the crust of mostly anorthosite the moon rock samples of the flood lavas that erupted onto the surface from partial melting in the mantle confirm the mafic mantle composition which is more iron-rich than that of earth the crust is on average about 50 km 31 mi thick
the moon is the second-densest satellite in the solar system after io however the inner core of the moon is small with a radius of about 350 km 220 mi or less around 20% of the radius of the moon its composition is not well defined but is probably metallic iron alloyed with a small amount of sulfur and nickel analyses of the moons time-variable rotation suggest that it is at least partly molten


 surface geology 

the topography of the moon has been measured with laser altimetry and stereo image analysis its most visible topographic feature is the giant far-side south pole–aitken basin some 2,240 km 1,390 mi in diameter the largest crater on the moon and the second-largest confirmed impact crater in the solar system at 13 km 8.1 mi deep its floor is the lowest point on the surface of the moon the highest elevations of the moons surface are located directly to the northeast and it has been suggested might have been thickened by the oblique formation impact of the south pole–aitken basin other large impact basins such as imbrium serenitatis crisium smythii and orientale also possess regionally low elevations and elevated rims the far side of the lunar surface is on average about 1.9 km 1.2 mi higher than that of the near side
the discovery of fault scarp cliffs by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter suggest that the moon has shrunk within the past billion years by about 90 metres 300 ft similar shrinkage features exist on mercury


 volcanic features 

the dark and relatively featureless lunar plains clearly seen with the naked eye are called maria latin for seas singular mare as they were once believed to be filled with water they are now known to be vast solidified pools of ancient basaltic lava although similar to terrestrial basalts lunar basalts have more iron and no minerals altered by water the majority of these lavas erupted or flowed into the depressions associated with impact basins several geologic provinces containing shield volcanoes and volcanic domes are found within the near side maria

almost all maria are on the near side of the moon and cover 31% of the surface of the near side compared with 2% of the far side this is thought to be due to a concentration of heat-producing elements under the crust on the near side seen on geochemical maps obtained by lunar prospectors gamma-ray spectrometer which would have caused the underlying mantle to heat up partially melt rise to the surface and erupt most of the moons mare basalts erupted during the imbrian period 3.0–3.5 billion years ago although some radiometrically dated samples are as old as 4.2 billion years until recently the youngest eruptions dated by crater counting appeared to have been only 1.2 billion years ago in 2006 a study of ina a tiny depression in lacus felicitatis found jagged relatively dust-free features that due to the lack of erosion by infalling debris appeared to be only 2 million years old moonquakes and releases of gas also indicate some continued lunar activity in 2014 nasa announced widespread evidence of young lunar volcanism at 70 irregular mare patches identified by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter some less than 50 million years old this raises the possibility of a much warmer lunar mantle than previously believed at least on the near side where the deep crust is substantially warmer due to the greater concentration of radioactive elements just prior to this evidence has been presented for 2–10 million years younger basaltic volcanism inside lowell crater orientale basin located in the transition zone between the near and far sides of the moon an initially hotter mantle andor local enrichment of heat-producing elements in the mantle could be responsible for prolonged activities also on the far side in the orientale basin
the lighter-coloured regions of the moon are called terrae or more commonly highlands because they are higher than most maria they have been radiometrically dated to having formed 4.4 billion years ago and may represent plagioclase cumulates of the lunar magma ocean in contrast to earth no major lunar mountains are believed to have formed as a result of tectonic events
the concentration of maria on the near side likely reflects the substantially thicker crust of the highlands of the far side which may have formed in a slow-velocity impact of a second moon of earth a few tens of millions of years after their formation


 impact craters 

the other major geologic process that has affected the moons surface is impact cratering with craters formed when asteroids and comets collide with the lunar surface there are estimated to be roughly 300,000 craters wider than 1 km 0.6 mi on the moons near side alone the lunar geologic timescale is based on the most prominent impact events including nectaris imbrium and orientale structures characterized by multiple rings of uplifted material between hundreds and thousands of kilometres in diameter and associated with a broad apron of ejecta deposits that form a regional stratigraphic horizon the lack of an atmosphere weather and recent geological processes mean that many of these craters are well-preserved although only a few multi-ring basins have been definitively dated they are useful for assigning relative ages because impact craters accumulate at a nearly constant rate counting the number of craters per unit area can be used to estimate the age of the surface the radiometric ages of impact-melted rocks collected during the apollo missions cluster between 3.8 and 4.1 billion years old this has been used to propose a late heavy bombardment of impacts
blanketed on top of the moons crust is a highly comminuted broken into ever smaller particles and impact gardened surface layer called regolith formed by impact processes the finer regolith the lunar soil of silicon dioxide glass has a texture resembling snow and a scent resembling spent gunpowder the regolith of older surfaces is generally thicker than for younger surfaces it varies in thickness from 10–20 km 6.2–12.4 mi in the highlands and 3–5 km 1.9–3.1 mi in the maria beneath the finely comminuted regolith layer is the megaregolith a layer of highly fractured bedrock many kilometres thick
comparison of high-resolution images obtained by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter has shown a contemporary crater-production rate significantly higher than previously estimated a secondary cratering process caused by distal ejecta is thought to churn the top two centimetres of regolith a hundred times more quickly than previous models suggested–on a timescale of 81,000 years


 lunar swirls 

lunar swirls are enigmatic features found across the moons surface which are characterized by a high albedo appearing optically immature ie the optical characteristics of a relatively young regolith and often displaying a sinuous shape their curvilinear shape is often accentuated by low albedo regions that wind between the bright swirls


 presence of water 

liquid water cannot persist on the lunar surface when exposed to solar radiation water quickly decomposes through a process known as photodissociation and is lost to space however since the 1960s scientists have hypothesized that water ice may be deposited by impacting comets or possibly produced by the reaction of oxygen-rich lunar rocks and hydrogen from solar wind leaving traces of water which could possibly persist in cold permanently shadowed craters at either pole on the moon computer simulations suggest that up to 14,000 km2 5,400 sq mi of the surface may be in permanent shadow the presence of usable quantities of water on the moon is an important factor in rendering lunar habitation as a cost-effective plan the alternative of transporting water from earth would be prohibitively expensive
in years since signatures of water have been found to exist on the lunar surface in 1994 the bistatic radar experiment located on the clementine spacecraft indicated the existence of small frozen pockets of water close to the surface however later radar observations by arecibo suggest these findings may rather be rocks ejected from young impact craters in 1998 the neutron spectrometer on the lunar prospector spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions volcanic lava beads brought back to earth aboard apollo 15 showed small amounts of water in their interior
the 2008 chandrayaan-1 spacecraft has since confirmed the existence of surface water ice using the on-board moon mineralogy mapper the spectrometer observed absorption lines common to hydroxyl in reflected sunlight providing evidence of large quantities of water ice on the lunar surface the spacecraft showed that concentrations may possibly be as high as 1,000 ppm in 2009 lcross sent a 2,300 kg 5,100 lb impactor into a permanently shadowed polar crater and detected at least 100 kg 220 lb of water in a plume of ejected material another examination of the lcross data showed the amount of detected water to be closer to 155 ± 12 kg 342 ± 26 lb
in may 2011 615–1410 ppm water in melt inclusions in lunar sample 74220 was reported the famous high-titanium orange glass soil of volcanic origin collected during the apollo 17 mission in 1972 the inclusions were formed during explosive eruptions on the moon approximately 3.7 billion years ago this concentration is comparable with that of magma in earths upper mantle although of considerable selenological interest this announcement affords little comfort to would-be lunar colonists—the sample originated many kilometers below the surface and the inclusions are so difficult to access that it took 39 years to find them with a state-of-the-art ion microprobe instrument


 gravitational field 

the gravitational field of the moon has been measured through tracking the doppler shift of radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft the main lunar gravity features are mascons large positive gravitational anomalies associated with some of the giant impact basins partly caused by the dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill those basins the anomalies greatly influence the orbit of spacecraft about the moon there are some puzzles lava flows by themselves cannot explain all of the gravitational signature and some mascons exist that are not linked to mare volcanism


 magnetic field 

the moon has an external magnetic field of about 1–100 nanoteslas less than one-hundredth that of earth it does not currently have a global dipolar magnetic field and only has crustal magnetization probably acquired early in lunar history when a dynamo was still operating alternatively some of the remnant magnetization may be from transient magnetic fields generated during large impact events through the expansion of an impact-generated plasma cloud in the presence of an ambient magnetic field this is supported by the apparent location of the largest crustal magnetizations near the antipodes of the giant impact basins


 atmosphere 

the moon has an atmosphere so tenuous as to be nearly vacuum with a total mass of less than 10 metric tons 9.8 long tons 11 short tons the surface pressure of this small mass is around 3 × 10−15 atm 0.3 npa it varies with the lunar day its sources include outgassing and sputtering a product of the bombardment of lunar soil by solar wind ions elements that have been detected include sodium and potassium produced by sputtering also found in the atmospheres of mercury and io helium-4 and neon from the solar wind and argon-40 radon-222 and polonium-210 outgassed after their creation by radioactive decay within the crust and mantle the absence of such neutral species atoms or molecules as oxygen nitrogen carbon hydrogen and magnesium which are present in the regolith is not understood water vapour has been detected by chandrayaan-1 and found to vary with latitude with a maximum at 60–70 degrees it is possibly generated from the sublimation of water ice in the regolith these gases either return into the regolith due to the moons gravity or are lost to space either through solar radiation pressure or if they are ionized by being swept away by the solar winds magnetic field


 dust 
a permanent asymmetric moon dust cloud exists around the moon created by small particles from comets estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the moons surface each 24 hours the particles strike the moons surface ejecting moon dust above the moon the dust stays above the moon approximately 10 minutes taking 5 minutes to rise and 5 minutes to fall on average 120 kilograms of dust are present above the moon rising to 100 kilometers above the surface the dust measurements were made by ladees lunar dust experiment ldex between 20 and 100 kilometers above the surface during a six-month period ldex detected an average of one 0.3 micrometer moon dust particle each minute dust particle counts peaked during the geminid quadrantid northern taurid and omicron centaurid meteor showers when the earth and moon pass through comet debris the cloud is asymmetric more dense near the boundary between the moons dayside and nightside


 past thicker atmosphere 
in october 2017 nasa scientists at the marshall space flight center and the lunar and planetary institute in houston announced their finding based on studies of moon magma samples retrieved by the apollo missions that the moon had once possessed a relatively thick atmosphere for a period of 70 million years between 3 and 4 billion years ago this atmosphere sourced from gases ejected from lunar volcanic eruptions was twice the thickness of that of present-day mars the ancient lunar atmosphere was eventually stripped away by solar winds and dissipated into space


 seasons 
the moons axial tilt with respect to the ecliptic is only 1.5424° much less than the 23.44° of earth because of this the moons solar illumination varies much less with season and topographical details play a crucial role in seasonal effects from images taken by clementine in 1994 it appears that four mountainous regions on the rim of peary crater at the moons north pole may remain illuminated for the entire lunar day creating peaks of eternal light no such regions exist at the south pole similarly there are places that remain in permanent shadow at the bottoms of many polar craters and these craters of eternal darkness are extremely cold lunar reconnaissance orbiter measured the lowest summer temperatures in craters at the southern pole at 35 k −238 °c −397 °f and just 26 k −247 °c −413 °f close to the winter solstice in north polar hermite crater this is the coldest temperature in the solar system ever measured by a spacecraft colder even than the surface of pluto average temperatures of the moons surface are reported but temperatures of different areas will vary greatly depending upon whether they are in sunlight or shadow


 relationship to earth 


 orbit 

the moon makes a complete orbit around earth with respect to the fixed stars about once every 27.3 days its sidereal period however because earth is moving in its orbit around the sun at the same time it takes slightly longer for the moon to show the same phase to earth which is about 29.5 days its synodic period unlike most satellites of other planets the moon orbits closer to the ecliptic plane than to the planets equatorial plane the moons orbit is subtly perturbed by the sun and earth in many small complex and interacting ways for example the plane of the moons orbit gradually rotates once every 18.61 years which affects other aspects of lunar motion these follow-on effects are mathematically described by cassinis laws


 relative size 
the moon is exceptionally large relative to earth a quarter its diameter and 1/81 its mass it is the largest moon in the solar system relative to the size of its planet though charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet pluto at 1/9 plutos mass the earth and the moons barycentre their common centre of mass is located 1,700 km 1,100 mi about a quarter of earths radius beneath earths surface
the earth revolves around the earth-moon barycentre once a sidereal month moving at 1/81 the speed of the moon or about 12.5 metres 41 ft per second this motion is superimposed on the much larger revolution of the earth around the sun at a speed of about 30 kilometres 19 mi per second


 appearance from earth 

the moon is in synchronous rotation as it orbits earth it rotates about its axis in about the same time it takes to orbit earth this results in it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards earth however due to the effect of libration about 59% of the moons surface can actually be seen from earth the side of the moon that faces earth is called the near side and the opposite the far side the far side is often inaccurately called the dark side but it is in fact illuminated as often as the near side once every 29.5 earth days during new moon the near side is dark
the moon had once rotated at a faster rate but early in its history its rotation slowed and became tidally locked in this orientation as a result of frictional effects associated with tidal deformations caused by earth with time the energy of rotation of the moon on its axis was dissipated as heat until there was no rotation of the moon relative to earth in 2016 planetary scientists using data collected on the much earlier nasa lunar prospector mission found two hydrogen-rich areas on opposite sides of the moon probably in the form of water ice it is speculated that these patches were the poles of the moon billions of years ago before it was tidally locked to earth
the moon has an exceptionally low albedo giving it a reflectance that is slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt despite this it is the brightest object in the sky after the sun this is partly due to the brightness enhancement of the opposition surge the moon at quarter phase is only one-tenth as bright rather than half as bright as at full moon additionally color constancy in the visual system recalibrates the relations between the colors of an object and its surroundings and because the surrounding sky is comparatively dark the sunlit moon is perceived as a bright object the edges of the full moon seem as bright as the centre without limb darkening due to the reflective properties of lunar soil which retroreflects light more towards the sun than in other directions the moon does appear larger when close to the horizon but this is a purely psychological effect known as the moon illusion first described in the 7th century bc the full moons angular diameter is about 0.52° on average in the sky roughly the same apparent size as the sun see § eclipses
the moons highest altitude at culmination varies by its phase and time of year the full moon is currently northernmost during winter the 18.61-year nodal cycle has an influence on lunar standstill when the ascending node of the lunar orbit is in the vernal equinox the lunar declination can reach up to plus or minus 28° each month this means the moon can pass overhead if viewed from latitudes up to 28° north or south of the equator instead of only 18° the orientation of the moons crescent also depends on the latitude of the viewing location an observer in the tropics can see a smile-shaped crescent moon the moon is visible for two weeks every 27.3 days at the north and south poles zooplankton in the arctic use moonlight when the sun is below the horizon for months on end

the distance between the moon and earth varies from around 356,400 km 221,500 mi to 406,700 km 252,700 mi at perigee closest and apogee farthest respectively on 14 november 2016 it was closer to earth when at full phase than it has been since 1948 14% closer than its farthest position in apogee reported as a supermoon this closest point coincides within an hour of a full moon and it was 30% more luminous than when at its greatest distance due to its angular diameter being 14% greater because

there has been historical controversy over whether features on the moons surface change over time today many of these claims are thought to be illusory resulting from observation under different lighting conditions poor astronomical seeing or inadequate drawings however outgassing does occasionally occur and could be responsible for a minor percentage of the reported lunar transient phenomena recently it has been suggested that a roughly 3 km 1.9 mi diameter region of the lunar surface was modified by a gas release event about a million years ago
the moons appearance like the suns can be affected by earths atmosphere common optical effects are the 22° halo ring formed when the moons light is refracted through the ice crystals of high cirrostratus clouds and smaller coronal rings when the moon is seen through thin clouds

 tidal effects 

the gravitational attraction that masses have for one another decreases inversely with the square of the distance of those masses from each other as a result the slightly greater attraction that the moon has for the side of earth closest to the moon as compared to the part of the earth opposite the moon results in tidal forces tidal forces affect both the earths crust and oceans
the most obvious effect of tidal forces is to cause two bulges in the earths oceans one on the side facing the moon and the other on the side opposite this results in elevated sea levels called ocean tides as the earth spins on its axis one of the ocean bulges high tide is held in place under the moon while another such tide is opposite as a result there are two high tides and two low tides in about 24 hours since the moon is orbiting the earth in the same direction of the earths rotation the high tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes the 25 minutes is due to the moons time to orbit the earth the sun has the same tidal effect on the earth but its forces of attraction are only 40% that of the moons the suns and moons interplay is responsible for spring and neap tides if the earth were a water world one with no continents it would produce a tide of only one meter and that tide would be very predictable but the ocean tides are greatly modified by other effects the frictional coupling of water to earths rotation through the ocean floors the inertia of waters movement ocean basins that grow shallower near land the sloshing of water between different ocean basins as a result the timing of the tides at most points on the earth is a product of observations that are explained incidentally by theory
while gravitation causes acceleration and movement of the earths fluid oceans gravitational coupling between the moon and earths solid body is mostly elastic and plastic the result is a further tidal effect of the moon on the earth that causes a bulge of the solid portion of the earth nearest the moon that acts as a torque in opposition to the earths rotation this drains angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy from earths spin slowing the earths rotation that angular momentum lost from the earth is transferred to the moon in a process confusingly known as tidal acceleration which lifts the moon into a higher orbit and results in its lower orbital speed about the earth thus the distance between earth and moon is increasing and the earths spin is slowing in reaction measurements from laser reflectors left during the apollo missions lunar ranging experiments have found that the moons distance increases by 38 mm 1.5 in per year roughly the rate at which human fingernails grow atomic clocks also show that earths day lengthens by about 15 microseconds every year slowly increasing the rate at which utc is adjusted by leap seconds left to run its course this tidal drag would continue until the spin of earth and the orbital period of the moon matched creating mutual tidal locking between the two as a result the moon would be suspended in the sky over one meridian as is already currently the case with pluto and its moon charon however the sun will become a red giant engulfing the earth-moon system long before this occurrence
in a like manner the lunar surface experiences tides of around 10 cm 4 in amplitude over 27 days with two components a fixed one due to earth because they are in synchronous rotation and a varying component from the sun the earth-induced component arises from libration a result of the moons orbital eccentricity if the moons orbit were perfectly circular there would only be solar tides libration also changes the angle from which the moon is seen allowing a total of about 59% of its surface to be seen from earth over time the cumulative effects of stress built up by these tidal forces produces moonquakes moonquakes are much less common and weaker than are earthquakes although moon quakes can last for up to an hour—a significantly longer time than terrestrial quakes—because of the absence of water to damp out the seismic vibrations the existence of moonquakes was an unexpected discovery from seismometers placed on the moon by apollo astronauts from 1969 through 1972

eclipses can only occur when the sun earth and moon are all in a straight line termed syzygy solar eclipses occur at new moon when the moon is between the sun and earth in contrast lunar eclipses occur at full moon when earth is between the sun and moon the apparent size of the moon is roughly the same as that of the sun with both being viewed at close to one-half a degree wide the sun is much larger than the moon but it is the vastly greater distance that gives it the same apparent size as the much closer and much smaller moon from the perspective of earth the variations in apparent size due to the non-circular orbits are nearly the same as well though occurring in different cycles this makes possible both total with the moon appearing larger than the sun and annular with the moon appearing smaller than the sun solar eclipses in a total eclipse the moon completely covers the disc of the sun and the solar corona becomes visible to the naked eye because the distance between the moon and earth is very slowly increasing over time the angular diameter of the moon is decreasing also as it evolves toward becoming a red giant the size of the sun and its apparent diameter in the sky are slowly increasing the combination of these two changes means that hundreds of millions of years ago the moon would always completely cover the sun on solar eclipses and no annular eclipses were possible likewise hundreds of millions of years in the future the moon will no longer cover the sun completely and total solar eclipses will not occur
because the moons orbit around earth is inclined by about 5.145° 5° 9 to the orbit of earth around the sun eclipses do not occur at every full and new moon for an eclipse to occur the moon must be near the intersection of the two orbital planes the periodicity and recurrence of eclipses of the sun by the moon and of the moon by earth is described by the saros which has a period of approximately 18 years
because the moon is continuously blocking our view of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky the related phenomenon of occultation occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the moon and is occulted hidden from view in this way a solar eclipse is an occultation of the sun because the moon is comparatively close to earth occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet nor at the same time because of the precession of the lunar orbit each year different stars are occulted


 observation and exploration 


 ancient and medieval studies 

understanding of the moons cycles was an early development of astronomy by the 5th century bc babylonian astronomers had recorded the 18-year saros cycle of lunar eclipses and indian astronomers had described the moons monthly elongation the chinese astronomer shi shen fl 4th century bc gave instructions for predicting solar and lunar eclipses later the physical form of the moon and the cause of moonlight became understood the ancient greek philosopher anaxagoras d 428 bc reasoned that the sun and moon were both giant spherical rocks and that the latter reflected the light of the former although the chinese of the han dynasty believed the moon to be energy equated to qi their radiating influence theory also recognized that the light of the moon was merely a reflection of the sun and jing fang 78–37 bc noted the sphericity of the moon in the 2nd century ad lucian wrote the novel a true story in which the heroes travel to the moon and meet its inhabitants in 499 ad the indian astronomer aryabhata mentioned in his aryabhatiya that reflected sunlight is the cause of the shining of the moon the astronomer and physicist alhazen 965–1039 found that sunlight was not reflected from the moon like a mirror but that light was emitted from every part of the moons sunlit surface in all directions shen kuo 1031–1095 of the song dynasty created an allegory equating the waxing and waning of the moon to a round ball of reflective silver that when doused with white powder and viewed from the side would appear to be a crescent

in aristotles 384–322 bc description of the universe the moon marked the boundary between the spheres of the mutable elements earth water air and fire and the imperishable stars of aether an influential philosophy that would dominate for centuries however in the 2nd century bc seleucus of seleucia correctly theorized that tides were due to the attraction of the moon and that their height depends on the moons position relative to the sun in the same century aristarchus computed the size and distance of the moon from earth obtaining a value of about twenty times the radius of earth for the distance these figures were greatly improved by ptolemy 90–168 ad his values of a mean distance of 59 times earths radius and a diameter of 0.292 earth diameters were close to the correct values of about 60 and 0.273 respectively archimedes 287–212 bc designed a planetarium that could calculate the motions of the moon and other objects in the solar system
during the middle ages before the invention of the telescope the moon was increasingly recognised as a sphere though many believed that it was perfectly smooth
in 1609 galileo galilei drew one of the first telescopic drawings of the moon in his book sidereus nuncius and noted that it was not smooth but had mountains and craters telescopic mapping of the moon followed later in the 17th century the efforts of giovanni battista riccioli and francesco maria grimaldi led to the system of naming of lunar features in use today the more exact 1834–36 mappa selenographica of wilhelm beer and johann heinrich mädler and their associated 1837 book der mond the first trigonometrically accurate study of lunar features included the heights of more than a thousand mountains and introduced the study of the moon at accuracies possible in earthly geography lunar craters first noted by galileo were thought to be volcanic until the 1870s proposal of richard proctor that they were formed by collisions this view gained support in 1892 from the experimentation of geologist grove karl gilbert and from comparative studies from 1920 to the 1940s leading to the development of lunar stratigraphy which by the 1950s was becoming a new and growing branch of astrogeology


 by spacecraft 


 20th century 


 soviet missions 

the cold war-inspired space race between the soviet union and the us led to an acceleration of interest in exploration of the moon once launchers had the necessary capabilities these nations sent unmanned probes on both flyby and impactlander missions spacecraft from the soviet unions luna program were the first to accomplish a number of goals following three unnamed failed missions in 1958 the first human-made object to escape earths gravity and pass near the moon was luna 1 the first human-made object to impact the lunar surface was luna 2 and the first photographs of the normally occluded far side of the moon were made by luna 3 all in 1959
the first spacecraft to perform a successful lunar soft landing was luna 9 and the first unmanned vehicle to orbit the moon was luna 10 both in 1966 rock and soil samples were brought back to earth by three luna sample return missions luna 16 in 1970 luna 20 in 1972 and luna 24 in 1976 which returned 0.3 kg total two pioneering robotic rovers landed on the moon in 1970 and 1973 as a part of soviet lunokhod programme
luna 24 was the last sovietrussian mission to the moon


 united states missions 

during the late 1950s at the height of the cold war the united states army conducted a classified feasibility study that proposed the construction of a manned military outpost on the moon called project horizon with the potential to conduct a wide range of missions from scientific research to nuclear earth bombardment the study included the possibility of conducting a lunar-based nuclear test the air force which at the time was in competition with the army for a leading role in the space program developed its own similar plan called lunex however both these proposals were ultimately passed over as the space program was largely transferred from the military to the civilian agency nasa
following president john f kennedys 1961 commitment to a manned moon landing before the end of the decade the united states under nasa leadership launched a series of unmanned probes to develop an understanding of the lunar surface in preparation for manned missions the jet propulsion laboratorys ranger program produced the first close-up pictures the lunar orbiter program produced maps of the entire moon the surveyor program landed its first spacecraft four months after luna 9 the manned apollo program was developed in parallel after a series of unmanned and manned tests of the apollo spacecraft in earth orbit and spurred on by a potential soviet lunar flight in 1968 apollo 8 made the first manned mission to lunar orbit the subsequent landing of the first humans on the moon in 1969 is seen by many as the culmination of the space race

neil armstrong became the first person to walk on the moon as the commander of the american mission apollo 11 by first setting foot on the moon at 0256 utc on 21 july 1969 an estimated 500 million people worldwide watched the transmission by the apollo tv camera the largest television audience for a live broadcast at that time the apollo missions 11 to 17 except apollo 13 which aborted its planned lunar landing returned 380.05 kilograms 837.87 lb of lunar rock and soil in 2,196 separate samples the american moon landing and return was enabled by considerable technological advances in the early 1960s in domains such as ablation chemistry software engineering and atmospheric re-entry technology and by highly competent management of the enormous technical undertaking
scientific instrument packages were installed on the lunar surface during all the apollo landings long-lived instrument stations including heat flow probes seismometers and magnetometers were installed at the apollo 12 14 15 16 and 17 landing sites direct transmission of data to earth concluded in late 1977 due to budgetary considerations but as the stations lunar laser ranging corner-cube retroreflector arrays are passive instruments they are still being used ranging to the stations is routinely performed from earth-based stations with an accuracy of a few centimetres and data from this experiment are being used to place constraints on the size of the lunar core


 1980s–2000 

after the first moon race there were years of near quietude but starting in the 1990s many more countries have become involved in direct exploration of the moon in 1990 japan became the third country to place a spacecraft into lunar orbit with its hiten spacecraft the spacecraft released a smaller probe hagoromo in lunar orbit but the transmitter failed preventing further scientific use of the mission in 1994 the us sent the joint defense departmentnasa spacecraft clementine to lunar orbit this mission obtained the first near-global topographic map of the moon and the first global multispectral images of the lunar surface this was followed in 1998 by the lunar prospector mission whose instruments indicated the presence of excess hydrogen at the lunar poles which is likely to have been caused by the presence of water ice in the upper few meters of the regolith within permanently shadowed craters
india japan china the united states and the european space agency each sent lunar orbiters and especially isros chandrayaan-1 has contributed to confirming the discovery of lunar water ice in permanently shadowed craters at the poles and bound into the lunar regolith the post-apollo era has also seen two rover missions the final soviet lunokhod mission in 1973 and chinas ongoing change 3 mission which deployed its yutu rover on 14 december 2013 the moon remains under the outer space treaty free to all nations to explore for peaceful purposes


 21st century 

the european spacecraft smart-1 the second ion-propelled spacecraft was in lunar orbit from 15 november 2004 until its lunar impact on 3 september 2006 and made the first detailed survey of chemical elements on the lunar surface
the ambitious chinese lunar exploration program began with change 1 which successfully orbited the moon from 5 november 2007 until its controlled lunar impact on 1 march 2009 it obtained a full image map of the moon change 2 beginning in october 2010 reached the moon more quickly mapped the moon at a higher resolution over an eight-month period then left lunar orbit for an extended stay at the earth–sun l2 lagrangian point before finally performing a flyby of asteroid 4179 toutatis on 13 december 2012 and then heading off into deep space on 14 december 2013 change 3 landed a lunar lander onto the moons surface which in turn deployed a lunar rover named yutu chinese 玉兔 literally jade rabbit this was the first lunar soft landing since luna 24 in 1976 and the first lunar rover mission since lunokhod 2 in 1973 china intends to launch another rover mission change 4 before 2020 followed by a sample return mission change 5 soon after
between 4 october 2007 and 10 june 2009 the japan aerospace exploration agencys kaguya selene mission a lunar orbiter fitted with a high-definition video camera and two small radio-transmitter satellites obtained lunar geophysics data and took the first high-definition movies from beyond earth orbit indias first lunar mission chandrayaan i orbited from 8 november 2008 until loss of contact on 27 august 2009 creating a high resolution chemical mineralogical and photo-geological map of the lunar surface and confirming the presence of water molecules in lunar soil the indian space research organisation planned to launch chandrayaan ii in 2013 which would have included a russian robotic lunar rover however the failure of russias fobos-grunt mission has delayed this project

the us co-launched the lunar reconnaissance orbiter lro and the lcross impactor and follow-up observation orbiter on 18 june 2009 lcross completed its mission by making a planned and widely observed impact in the crater cabeus on 9 october 2009 whereas lro is currently in operation obtaining precise lunar altimetry and high-resolution imagery in november 2011 the lro passed over the large and bright aristarchus crater nasa released photos of the crater on 25 december 2011
two nasa grail spacecraft began orbiting the moon around 1 january 2012 on a mission to learn more about the moons internal structure nasas ladee probe designed to study the lunar exosphere achieved orbit on 6 october 2013
upcoming lunar missions include russias luna-glob an unmanned lander with a set of seismometers and an orbiter based on its failed martian fobos-grunt mission privately funded lunar exploration has been promoted by the google lunar x prize announced 13 september 2007 which offers us20 million to anyone who can land a robotic rover on the moon and meet other specified criteria shackleton energy company is building a program to establish operations on the south pole of the moon to harvest water and supply their propellant depots
nasa began to plan to resume manned missions following the call by us president george w bush on 14 january 2004 for a manned mission to the moon by 2019 and the construction of a lunar base by 2024 the constellation program was funded and construction and testing begun on a manned spacecraft and launch vehicle and design studies for a lunar base however that program has been cancelled in favor of a manned asteroid landing by 2025 and a manned mars orbit by 2035 india has also expressed its hope to send a manned mission to the moon by 2020
on february 28 2018 spacex vodafone nokia and audi announced a collaboration to install a 4g wireless communication network on the moon with the aim of streaming live footage on the surface to earth


 planned commercial missions 
in 2007 the x prize foundation together with google launched the google lunar x prize to encourage commercial endeavors to the moon a prize of 20 million will be awarded to the first private venture to get to the moon with a robotic lander by the end of march 2018 with additional prizes worth 10 million for further milestones as of august 2016 16 teams are participating in the competition
in august 2016 the us government granted permission to us-based start-up moon express to land on the moon this marked the first time that a private enterprise was given the right to do so the decision is regarded as a precedent helping to define regulatory standards for deep-space commercial activity in the future as thus far companies operation had been restricted to being on or around earth


 astronomy from the moon 

for many years the moon has been recognized as an excellent site for telescopes it is relatively nearby astronomical seeing is not a concern certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold and thus especially useful for infrared telescopes and radio telescopes on the far side would be shielded from the radio chatter of earth the lunar soil although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and epoxies and employed in the construction of mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter a lunar zenith telescope can be made cheaply with ionic liquid
in april 1972 the apollo 16 mission recorded various astronomical photos and spectra in ultraviolet with the far ultraviolet cameraspectrograph


 legal status 

although luna landers scattered pennants of the soviet union on the moon and us flags were symbolically planted at their landing sites by the apollo astronauts no nation claims ownership of any part of the moons surface russia and the us are party to the 1967 outer space treaty which defines the moon and all outer space as the province of all mankind this treaty also restricts the use of the moon to peaceful purposes explicitly banning military installations and weapons of mass destruction the 1979 moon agreement was created to restrict the exploitation of the moons resources by any single nation but as of november 2016 it has been signed and ratified by only 18 nations none of which engages in self-launched human space exploration or has plans to do so although several individuals have made claims to the moon in whole or in part none of these are considered credible


 in culture 


 mythology 

a 5,000-year-old rock carving at knowth ireland may represent the moon which would be the earliest depiction discovered the contrast between the brighter highlands and the darker maria creates the patterns seen by different cultures as the man in the moon the rabbit and the buffalo among others in many prehistoric and ancient cultures the moon was personified as a deity or other supernatural phenomenon and astrological views of the moon continue to be propagated today
in proto-indo-european religion the moon was personified as the male god meh1not the ancient sumerians believed that the moon was the god nanna who was the father of inanna the goddess of the planet venus and utu the god of the sun nanna was later known as sîn and was particularly associated with magic and sorcery in greco-roman mythology the sun and the moon are represented as male and female respectively heliossol and seleneluna this is a development unique to the eastern mediterranean and traces of an earlier male moon god in the greek tradition are preserved in the figure of menelaus
in mesopotamian iconography the crescent was the primary symbol of nanna-sîn in ancient greek art the moon goddess selene was represented wearing a crescent on her headgear in an arrangement reminiscent of horns the star and crescent arrangement also goes back to the bronze age representing either the sun and moon or the moon and planet venus in combination it came to represent the goddess artemis or hecate and via the patronage of hecate came to be used as a symbol of byzantium
an iconographic tradition of representing sun and moon with faces developed in the late medieval period
the splitting of the moon arabic انشقاق القمر‎ is a miracle attributed to muhammad


 calendar 

the moons regular phases make it a very convenient timepiece and the periods of its waxing and waning form the basis of many of the oldest calendars tally sticks notched bones dating as far back as 20–30,000 years ago are believed by some to mark the phases of the moon the 30-day month is an approximation of the lunar cycle the english noun month and its cognates in other germanic languages stem from proto-germanic mǣnṓth- which is connected to the above-mentioned proto-germanic mǣnōn indicating the usage of a lunar calendar among the germanic peoples germanic calendar prior to the adoption of a solar calendar the pie root of moon méh1nōt derives from the pie verbal root meh1- to measure indicating a functional conception of the moon ie marker of the month cf the english words measure and menstrual and echoing the moons importance to many ancient cultures in measuring time see latin mensis and ancient greek μείσ meis or μήν mēn meaning month most historical calendars are lunisolar the 7th-century islamic calendar is an exceptional example of a purely lunar calendar months are traditionally determined by the visual sighting of the hilal or earliest crescent moon over the horizon


 lunacy 

the moon has long been associated with insanity and irrationality the words lunacy and lunatic popular shortening loony are derived from the latin name for the moon luna philosophers aristotle and pliny the elder argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals believing that the brain which is mostly water must be affected by the moon and its power over the tides but the moons gravity is too slight to affect any single person even today people who believe in a lunar effect claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals traffic accidents homicides or suicides increase during a full moon but dozens of studies invalidate these claims
