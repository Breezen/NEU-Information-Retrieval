 etymologyedit 

the name russia is derived from rus a medieval state populated mostly by the east slavs however this proper name became more prominent in the later history and the country typically was called by its inhabitants русская земля russkaja zemlja which can be translated as russian land or land of rus in order to distinguish this state from other states derived from it it is denoted as kievan rus by modern historiography the name rus itself comes from the early medieval rus people swedish merchants and warriors who relocated from across the baltic sea and founded a state centered on novgorod that later became kievan rus
an old latin version of the name rus was ruthenia mostly applied to the western and southern regions of rus that were adjacent to catholic europe the current name of the country россия rossija comes from the byzantine greek designation of the rus ρωσσία rossía—spelled ρωσία rosía pronounced roˈsia in modern greek
the standard way to refer to citizens of russia is russians in english and rossiyane russian россияне in russian there are two russian words which are commonly translated into english as russians one is русские russkiye which most often means ethnic russians another is россияне rossiyane which means citizens of russia regardless of ethnicity translations into other languages often do not distinguish these two groups


 historyedit 


 early historyedit 

nomadic pastoralism developed in the pontic-caspian steppe beginning in the chalcolithic
in classical antiquity the pontic steppe was known as scythia beginning in the 8th century bc ancient greek traders brought their civilization to the trade emporiums in tanais and phanagoria ancient greek explorers most notably pytheas even went as far as modern day kaliningrad on the baltic sea romans settled on the western part of the caspian sea where their empire stretched towards the east in the 3rd to 4th centuries ad a semi-legendary gothic kingdom of oium existed in southern russia until it was overrun by huns between the 3rd and 6th centuries ad the bosporan kingdom a hellenistic polity which succeeded the greek colonies was also overwhelmed by nomadic invasions led by warlike tribes such as the huns and eurasian avars a turkic people the khazars ruled the lower volga basin steppes between the caspian and black seas until the 10th century
the ancestors of modern russians are the slavic tribes whose original home is thought by some scholars to have been the wooded areas of the pinsk marshes the east slavs gradually settled western russia in two waves one moving from kiev toward present-day suzdal and murom and another from polotsk toward novgorod and rostov from the 7th century onwards the east slavs constituted the bulk of the population in western russia and assimilated the native finno-ugric peoples including the merya the muromians and the meshchera


 kievan rusedit 

the establishment of the first east slavic states in the 9th century coincided with the arrival of varangians the traders warriors and settlers from the baltic sea region primarily they were vikings of scandinavian origin who ventured along the waterways extending from the eastern baltic to the black and caspian seas according to the primary chronicle a varangian from rus people named rurik was elected ruler of novgorod in 862 in 882 his successor oleg ventured south and conquered kiev which had been previously paying tribute to the khazars founding kievan rus oleg ruriks son igor and igors son sviatoslav subsequently subdued all local east slavic tribes to kievan rule destroyed the khazar khaganate and launched several military expeditions to byzantium and persia
in the 10th to 11th centuries kievan rus became one of the largest and most prosperous states in europe the reigns of vladimir the great 980–1015 and his son yaroslav the wise 1019–1054 constitute the golden age of kiev which saw the acceptance of orthodox christianity from byzantium and the creation of the first east slavic written legal code the russkaya pravda
in the 11th and 12th centuries constant incursions by nomadic turkic tribes such as the kipchaks and the pechenegs caused a massive migration of slavic populations to the safer heavily forested regions of the north particularly to the area known as zalesye

the age of feudalism and decentralization was marked by constant in-fighting between members of the rurik dynasty that ruled kievan rus collectively kievs dominance waned to the benefit of vladimir-suzdal in the north-east novgorod republic in the north-west and galicia-volhynia in the south-west
ultimately kievan rus disintegrated with the final blow being the mongol invasion of 1237–40 that resulted in the destruction of kiev and the death of about half the population of rus the invading mongol elite together with their conquered turkic subjects cumans kipchaks bulgars became known as tatars forming the state of the golden horde which pillaged the russian principalities the mongols ruled the cuman-kipchak confederation and volga bulgaria modern-day southern and central expanses of russia for over two centuries
galicia-volhynia was eventually assimilated by the kingdom of poland while the mongol-dominated vladimir-suzdal and novgorod republic two regions on the periphery of kiev established the basis for the modern russian nation the novgorod together with pskov retained some degree of autonomy during the time of the mongol yoke and were largely spared the atrocities that affected the rest of the country led by prince alexander nevsky novgorodians repelled the invading swedes in the battle of the neva in 1240 as well as the germanic crusaders in the battle of the ice in 1242 breaking their attempts to colonize the northern rus


 grand duchy of moscowedit 

the most powerful state to eventually arise after the destruction of kievan rus was the grand duchy of moscow muscovy in the western chronicles initially a part of vladimir-suzdal while still under the domain of the mongol-tatars and with their connivance moscow began to assert its influence in the central rus in the early 14th century gradually becoming the leading force in the process of the rus lands reunification and expansion of russia moscows last rival the novgorod republic prospered as the chief fur trade center and the easternmost port of the hanseatic league
times remained difficult with frequent mongol-tatar raids agriculture suffered from the beginning of the little ice age as in the rest of europe plague was a frequent occurrence between 1350 and 1490 however because of the lower population density and better hygiene—widespread practicing of banya a wet steam bath—the death rate from plague was not as severe as in western europe and population numbers recovered by 1500
led by prince dmitry donskoy of moscow and helped by the russian orthodox church the united army of russian principalities inflicted a milestone defeat on the mongol-tatars in the battle of kulikovo in 1380 moscow gradually absorbed the surrounding principalities including formerly strong rivals such as tver and novgorod
ivan iii the great finally threw off the control of the golden horde and consolidated the whole of central and northern rus under moscows dominion he was also the first to take the title grand duke of all the russias after the fall of constantinople in 1453 moscow claimed succession to the legacy of the eastern roman empire ivan iii married sophia palaiologina the niece of the last byzantine emperor constantine xi and made the byzantine double-headed eagle his own and eventually russias coat-of-arms


 tsardom of russiaedit 

in development of the third rome ideas the grand duke ivan iv the terrible was officially crowned first tsar caesar of russia in 1547 the tsar promulgated a new code of laws sudebnik of 1550 established the first russian feudal representative body zemsky sobor and introduced local self-management into the rural regions
during his long reign ivan the terrible nearly doubled the already large russian territory by annexing the three tatar khanates parts of the disintegrated golden horde kazan and astrakhan along the volga river and the siberian khanate in southwestern siberia thus by the end of the 16th century russia was transformed into a multiethnic multidenominational and transcontinental state
however the tsardom was weakened by the long and unsuccessful livonian war against the coalition of poland lithuania and sweden for access to the baltic coast and sea trade at the same time the tatars of the crimean khanate the only remaining successor to the golden horde continued to raid southern russia in an effort to restore the volga khanates crimeans and their ottoman allies invaded central russia and were even able to burn down parts of moscow in 1571 but in the next year the large invading army was thoroughly defeated by russians in the battle of molodi forever eliminating the threat of an ottoman–crimean expansion into russia the slave raids of crimeans however did not cease until the late 17th century though the construction of new fortification lines across southern russia such as the great abatis line constantly narrowed the area accessible to incursions

the death of ivans sons marked the end of the ancient rurik dynasty in 1598 and in combination with the famine of 1601–03 led to civil war the rule of pretenders and foreign intervention during the time of troubles in the early 17th century the polish–lithuanian commonwealth occupied parts of russia including moscow in 1612 the poles were forced to retreat by the russian volunteer corps led by two national heroes merchant kuzma minin and prince dmitry pozharsky the romanov dynasty acceded to the throne in 1613 by the decision of zemsky sobor and the country started its gradual recovery from the crisis
russia continued its territorial growth through the 17th century which was the age of cossacks cossacks were warriors organized into military communities resembling pirates and pioneers of the new world in 1648 the peasants of ukraine joined the zaporozhian cossacks in rebellion against poland-lithuania during the khmelnytsky uprising in reaction to the social and religious oppression they had been suffering under polish rule in 1654 the ukrainian leader bohdan khmelnytsky offered to place ukraine under the protection of the russian tsar aleksey i alekseys acceptance of this offer led to another russo-polish war finally ukraine was split along the dnieper river leaving the western part right-bank ukraine under polish rule and the eastern part left-bank ukraine and kiev under russian rule later in 1670–71 the don cossacks led by stenka razin initiated a major uprising in the volga region but the tsars troops were successful in defeating the rebels
in the east the rapid russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of siberia was led mostly by cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory russian explorers pushed eastward primarily along the siberian river routes and by the mid-17th century there were russian settlements in eastern siberia on the chukchi peninsula along the amur river and on the pacific coast in 1648 the bering strait between asia and north america was passed for the first time by fedot popov and semyon dezhnyov


 imperial russiaedit 

under peter the great russia was proclaimed an empire in 1721 and became recognized as a world power ruling from 1682 to 1725 peter defeated sweden in the great northern war forcing it to cede west karelia and ingria two regions lost by russia in the time of troubles as well as estland and livland securing russias access to the sea and sea trade on the baltic sea peter founded a new capital called saint petersburg later known as russias window to europe peter the greats reforms brought considerable western european cultural influences to russia
the reign of peter is daughter elizabeth in 1741–62 saw russias participation in the seven years war 1756–63 during this conflict russia annexed east prussia for a while and even took berlin however upon elisabeths death all these conquests were returned to the kingdom of prussia by pro-prussian peter iii of russia
catherine ii the great who ruled in 1762–96 presided over the age of russian enlightenment she extended russian political control over the polish-lithuanian commonwealth and incorporated most of its territories into russia during the partitions of poland pushing the russian frontier westward into central europe in the south after successful russo-turkish wars against ottoman turkey catherine advanced russias boundary to the black sea defeating the crimean khanate as a result of victories over qajar iran through the russo-persian wars by the first half of the 19th century russia also made significant territorial gains in transcaucasia and the north caucasus forcing the former to irrevocably cede what is nowadays georgia dagestan azerbaijan and armenia to russia this continued with alexander is 1801–25 wresting of finland from the weakened kingdom of sweden in 1809 and of bessarabia from the ottomans in 1812 at the same time russians colonized alaska and even founded settlements in california such as fort ross

in 1803–1806 the first russian circumnavigation was made later followed by other notable russian sea exploration voyages in 1820 a russian expedition discovered the continent of antarctica
in alliances with various european countries russia fought against napoleons france the french invasion of russia at the height of napoleons power in 1812 reached moscow but eventually failed miserably as the obstinate resistance in combination with the bitterly cold russian winter led to a disastrous defeat of invaders in which more than 95% of the pan-european grande armée perished led by mikhail kutuzov and barclay de tolly the russian army ousted napoleon from the country and drove through europe in the war of the sixth coalition finally entering paris alexander i headed russias delegation at the congress of vienna that defined the map of post-napoleonic europe
the officers of the napoleonic wars brought ideas of liberalism back to russia with them and attempted to curtail the tsars powers during the abortive decembrist revolt of 1825 at the end of the conservative reign of nicolas i 1825–55 a zenith period of russias power and influence in europe was disrupted by defeat in the crimean war between 1847 and 1851 about one million people died of asiatic cholera
nicholass successor alexander ii 1855–81 enacted significant changes in the country including the emancipation reform of 1861 these great reforms spurred industrialization and modernized the russian army which had successfully liberated bulgaria from ottoman rule in the 1877–78 russo-turkish war

the late 19th century saw the rise of various socialist movements in russia alexander ii was killed in 1881 by revolutionary terrorists and the reign of his son alexander iii 1881–94 was less liberal but more peaceful the last russian emperor nicholas ii 1894–1917 was unable to prevent the events of the russian revolution of 1905 triggered by the unsuccessful russo-japanese war and the demonstration incident known as bloody sunday the uprising was put down but the government was forced to concede major reforms russian constitution of 1906 including granting the freedoms of speech and assembly the legalization of political parties and the creation of an elected legislative body the state duma of the russian empire the stolypin agrarian reform led to a massive peasant migration and settlement into siberia more than four million settlers arrived in that region between 1906 and 1914


 february revolution and russian republicedit 

in 1914 russia entered world war i in response to austria-hungarys declaration of war on russias ally serbia and fought across multiple fronts while isolated from its triple entente allies in 1916 the brusilov offensive of the russian army almost completely destroyed the military of austria-hungary however the already-existing public distrust of the regime was deepened by the rising costs of war high casualties and rumors of corruption and treason all this formed the climate for the russian revolution of 1917 carried out in two major acts
the february revolution forced nicholas ii to abdicate he and his family were imprisoned and later executed in yekaterinburg during the russian civil war the monarchy was replaced by a shaky coalition of political parties that declared itself the provisional government on september 1 14 1917 upon a decree of the provisional government the russian republic was proclaimed on january 6 19 1918 the russian constituent assembly declared russia a democratic federal republic thus ratifying the provisional governments decision the next day the constituent assembly was dissolved by the all-russian central executive committee


 soviet russia and civil waredit 

an alternative socialist establishment existed alongside the petrograd soviet wielding power through the democratically elected councils of workers and peasants called soviets the rule of the new authorities only aggravated the crisis in the country instead of resolving it eventually the october revolution led by bolshevik leader vladimir lenin overthrew the provisional government and gave full governing power to the soviets leading to the creation of the worlds first socialist state
following the october revolution a civil war broke out between the anti-communist white movement and the new soviet regime with its red army bolshevist russia lost its ukrainian polish baltic and finnish territories by signing the treaty of brest-litovsk that concluded hostilities with the central powers of world war i the allied powers launched an unsuccessful military intervention in support of anti-communist forces in the meantime both the bolsheviks and white movement carried out campaigns of deportations and executions against each other known respectively as the red terror and white terror by the end of the civil war russias economy and infrastructure were heavily damaged millions became white émigrés and the povolzhye famine of 1921 claimed up to 5 million victims


 soviet unionedit 

the russian soviet federative socialist republic called russian socialist federative soviet republic at the time together with the ukrainian byelorussian and transcaucasian soviet socialist republics formed the union of soviet socialist republics ussr or soviet union on december 30 1922 out of the 15 republics that would make up the ussr the largest in size and over half of the total ussr population was the russian sfsr which came to dominate the union for its entire 69-year history
following lenins death in 1924 a troika was designated to govern the soviet union however joseph stalin an elected general secretary of the communist party managed to suppress all opposition groups within the party and consolidate power in his hands leon trotsky the main proponent of world revolution was exiled from the soviet union in 1929 and stalins idea of socialism in one country became the primary line the continued internal struggle in the bolshevik party culminated in the great purge a period of mass repressions in 1937–38 during which hundreds of thousands of people were executed including original party members and military leaders accused of coup détat plots
under stalins leadership the government launched a planned economy industrialisation of the largely rural country and collectivization of its agriculture during this period of rapid economic and social change millions of people were sent to penal labor camps including many political convicts for their opposition to stalins rule millions were deported and exiled to remote areas of the soviet union the transitional disorganisation of the countrys agriculture combined with the harsh state policies and a drought led to the soviet famine of 1932–1933 the soviet union though with a heavy price was transformed from a largely agrarian economy to a major industrial powerhouse in a short span of time
under the doctrine of state atheism in the soviet union there was a government-sponsored program of forced conversion to atheism conducted by communists the communist regime targeted religions based on state interests and while most organized religions were never outlawed religious property was confiscated believers were harassed and religion was ridiculed while atheism was propagated in schools in 1925 the government founded the league of militant atheists to intensify the persecution accordingly although personal expressions of religious faith were not explicitly banned a strong sense of social stigma was imposed on them by the official structures and mass media and it was generally considered unacceptable for members of certain professions teachers state bureaucrats soldiers to be openly religious as for the russian orthodox church soviet authorities sought to control it and in times of national crisis to exploit it for the regimes own purposes but their ultimate goal was to eliminate it during the first five years of soviet power the bolsheviks executed 28 russian orthodox bishops and over 1,200 russian orthodox priests many others were imprisoned or exiled believers were harassed and persecuted most seminaries were closed and the publication of most religious material was prohibited by 1941 only 500 churches remained open out of about 54,000 in existence prior to world war i
the appeasement policy of great britain and france towards adolf hitlers annexation of austria and czechoslovakia did not stem an increase in the power of nazi germany around the same time the third reich allied with the empire of japan a rival of the ussr in the far east and an open enemy of the ussr in the soviet–japanese border wars in 1938–39

in august 1939 the soviet government decided to improve relations with germany by concluding the molotov-ribbentrop pact pledging non-aggression between the two countries and dividing eastern europe into their respective spheres of influence while hitler conquered poland and france and other countries acted on a single front at the start of world war ii the ussr was able to build up its military and occupy the western ukraine hertza region and northern bukovina as a result of the soviet invasion of poland winter war occupation of the baltic states and soviet occupation of bessarabia and northern bukovina
on june 22 1941 nazi germany broke the non-aggression treaty and invaded the soviet union with the largest and most powerful invasion force in human history opening the largest theater of world war ii although the german army had considerable early success their attack was halted in the battle of moscow subsequently the germans were dealt major defeats first at the battle of stalingrad in the winter of 1942–43 and then in the battle of kursk in the summer of 1943 another german failure was the siege of leningrad in which the city was fully blockaded on land between 1941 and 1944 by german and finnish forces and suffered starvation and more than a million deaths but never surrendered under stalins administration and the leadership of such commanders as georgy zhukov and konstantin rokossovsky soviet forces took eastern europe in 1944–45 and captured berlin in may 1945 in august 1945 the soviet army ousted the japanese from chinas manchukuo and north korea contributing to the allied victory over japan

the 1941–45 period of world war ii is known in russia as the great patriotic war the soviet union together with the united states the united kingdom and china were considered as the big four of allied powers in world war ii  and later became the four policemen which was the foundation of the united nations security council during this war which included many of the most lethal battle operations in human history soviet military and civilian deaths were 10.6 million and 15.9 million respectively accounting for about a third of all world war ii casualties the full demographic loss to the soviet peoples was even greater the soviet economy and infrastructure suffered massive devastation which caused the soviet famine of 1946–47 but the soviet union emerged as an acknowledged military superpower on the continent

after the war eastern and central europe including east germany and part of austria was occupied by red army according to the potsdam conference dependent socialist governments were installed in the eastern bloc satellite states becoming the worlds second nuclear weapons power the ussr established the warsaw pact alliance and entered into a struggle for global dominance known as the cold war with the united states and nato the soviet union supported revolutionary movements across the world including the newly formed peoples republic of china the democratic peoples republic of korea and later on the republic of cuba significant amounts of soviet resources were allocated in aid to the other socialist states
after stalins death and a short period of collective rule the new leader nikita khrushchev denounced the cult of personality of stalin and launched the policy of de-stalinization the penal labor system was reformed and many prisoners were released and rehabilitated many of them posthumously the general easement of repressive policies became known later as the khrushchev thaw at the same time tensions with the united states heightened when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the united states jupiter missiles in turkey and soviet missiles in cuba
in 1957 the soviet union launched the worlds first artificial satellite sputnik 1 thus starting the space age russias cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first human to orbit the earth aboard the vostok 1 manned spacecraft on april 12 1961
following the ousting of khrushchev in 1964 another period of collective rule ensued until leonid brezhnev became the leader the era of the 1970s and the early 1980s was designated later as the era of stagnation a period when economic growth slowed and social policies became static the 1965 kosygin reform aimed for partial decentralization of the soviet economy and shifted the emphasis from heavy industry and weapons to light industry and consumer goods but was stifled by the conservative communist leadership

in 1979 after a communist-led revolution in afghanistan soviet forces entered that country the occupation drained economic resources and dragged on without achieving meaningful political results ultimately the soviet army was withdrawn from afghanistan in 1989 due to international opposition persistent anti-soviet guerilla warfare and a lack of support by soviet citizens

from 1985 onwards the last soviet leader mikhail gorbachev who sought to enact liberal reforms in the soviet system introduced the policies of glasnost openness and perestroika restructuring in an attempt to end the period of economic stagnation and to democratise the government this however led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements prior to 1991 the soviet economy was the second largest in the world but during its last years it was afflicted by shortages of goods in grocery stores huge budget deficits and explosive growth in the money supply leading to inflation
by 1991 economic and political turmoil began to boil over as the baltic republics chose to secede from the soviet union on march 17 a referendum was held in which the vast majority of participating citizens voted in favour of changing the soviet union into a renewed federation in august 1991 a coup détat attempt by members of gorbachevs government directed against gorbachev and aimed at preserving the soviet union instead led to the end of the communist party of the soviet union on december 25 1991 the ussr was dissolved into 15 post-soviet states


 russian federationedit 

in june 1991 boris yeltsin became the first directly elected president in russian history when he was elected president of the russian soviet federative socialist republic which became the independent russian federation in december of that year during and after the disintegration of the soviet union wide-ranging reforms including privatization and market and trade liberalization were undertaken including radical changes along the lines of shock therapy as recommended by the united states and the international monetary fund all this resulted in a major economic crisis characterized by a 50% decline in both gdp and industrial output between 1990 and 1995
the privatization largely shifted control of enterprises from state agencies to individuals with inside connections in the government many of the newly rich moved billions in cash and assets outside of the country in an enormous capital flight the depression of the economy led to the collapse of social services the birth rate plummeted while the death rate skyrocketed millions plunged into poverty from a level of 1.5% in the late soviet era to 39–49% by mid-1993 the 1990s saw extreme corruption and lawlessness the rise of criminal gangs and violent crime
the 1990s were plagued by armed conflicts in the north caucasus both local ethnic skirmishes and separatist islamist insurrections from the time chechen separatists declared independence in the early 1990s an intermittent guerrilla war has been fought between the rebel groups and the russian military terrorist attacks against civilians carried out by separatists most notably the moscow theater hostage crisis and beslan school siege caused hundreds of deaths and drew worldwide attention
russia took up the responsibility for settling the ussrs external debts even though its population made up just half of the population of the ussr at the time of its dissolution high budget deficits caused the 1998 russian financial crisis and resulted in a further gdp decline

on december 31 1999 president yeltsin unexpectedly resigned handing the post to the recently appointed prime minister vladimir putin who then won the 2000 presidential election putin suppressed the chechen insurgency although sporadic violence still occurs throughout the northern caucasus high oil prices and the initially weak currency followed by increasing domestic demand consumption and investments has helped the economy grow for nine straight years improving the standard of living and increasing russias influence on the world stage however since the world economic crisis of 2008 and a subsequent drop in oil prices russias economy has stagnated and poverty has again started to rise while many reforms made during the putin presidency have been generally criticized by western nations as undemocratic putins leadership over the return of order stability and progress has won him widespread admiration in russia
on march 2 2008 dmitry medvedev was elected president of russia while putin became prime minister putin returned to the presidency following the 2012 presidential elections and medvedev was appointed prime minister
in 2014 after president viktor yanukovych of ukraine fled as a result of a revolution putin requested and received authorization from the russian parliament to deploy russian troops to ukraine following a crimean referendum in which separation was favored by a large majority of voters the russian leadership announced the accession of crimea into the russian federation though this and the referendum that preceded it were not accepted internationally on march 27 the united nations general assembly voted in favor of a non-binding resolution opposing the russian annexation of crimea by a vote of 100 member states in favour 11 against and 58 abstentions
in september 2015 russia started military intervention in the syrian civil war consisting of air strikes against militant groups of the islamic state al-nusra front al-qaeda in the levant and the army of conquest

as one of five permanent members of the un security council russia plays a major role in maintaining international peace and security the country participates in the quartet on the middle east and the six-party talks with north korea russia is a member of the g8 industrialized nations the council of europe osce and apec russia usually takes a leading role in regional organisations such as the cis eurasec csto and the sco russia became the 39th member state of the council of europe in 1996 in 1998 russia ratified the european convention on human rights the legal basis for eu relations with russia is the partnership and cooperation agreement which came into force in 1997 the agreement recalls the parties shared respect for democracy and human rights political and economic freedom and commitment to international peace and security in may 2003 the eu and russia agreed to reinforce their cooperation on the basis of common values and shared interests former president vladimir putin had advocated a strategic partnership with close integration in various dimensions including establishment of eu-russia common spaces since the dissolution of the soviet union russia has developed a friendlier relationship with the united states and nato the nato-russia council was established in 2002 to allow the united states russia and the 27 allies in nato to work together as equal partners to pursue opportunities for joint collaboration

russia maintains strong and positive relations with other bric countries india is the largest customer of russian military equipment and the two countries share extensive defense and strategic relations in recent years the country has strengthened bilateral ties especially with the peoples republic of china by signing the treaty of friendship as well as building the trans-siberian oil pipeline and gas pipeline from siberia to china
an important aspect of russias relations with the west is the criticism of russias political system and human rights management including lgbt rights media freedom and reports about killed journalists by western governments the mass media and the leading democracy and human rights watchdogs in particular such organisations as amnesty international and human rights watch consider russia to have not enough democratic attributes and to allow few political rights and civil liberties to its citizens freedom house an international organisation funded by the united states ranks russia as not free citing carefully engineered elections and absence of debate russian authorities dismiss these claims and especially criticise freedom house the russian ministry of foreign affairs has called the 2006 freedom in the world report prefabricated stating that the human rights issues have been turned into a political weapon in particular by the united states the ministry also claims that such organisations as freedom house and human rights watch use the same scheme of voluntary extrapolation of isolated facts that of course can be found in any country into dominant tendencies


 militaryedit 

the russian military is divided into the ground forces navy and air force there are also three independent arms of service strategic missile troops aerospace defence forces and the airborne troops in 2006 the military had 1.037 million personnel on active duty it is mandatory for all male citizens aged 18–27 to be drafted for a year of service in armed forces
russia has the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world it has the second largest fleet of ballistic missile submarines and is the only country apart from the united states with a modern strategic bomber force russias tank force is the largest in the world its surface navy and air force are among the largest ones
the country has a large and fully indigenous arms industry producing most of its own military equipment with only a few types of weapons imported russia is one of the worlds top supplier of arms a spot it has held since 2001 accounting for around 30% of worldwide weapons sales and exporting weapons to about 80 countries the stockholm international peace research institute sipri found that russia was the second biggest exporter of arms in 2010–14 increasing their exports by 37 per cent from the period 2005–2009 in 2010–14 russia delivered weapons to 56 states and to rebel forces in eastern ukraine
the russian governments published 2014 military budget is about 2.49 trillion rubles approximately us69.3 billion the third largest in the world behind the us and china the official budget is set to rise to 3.03 trillion rubles approximately us83.7 billion in 2015 and 3.36 trillion rubles approximately us93.9 billion in 2016 however unofficial estimates put the budget significantly higher for example the stockholm international peace research institute sipri 2013 military expenditure database estimated russias military expenditure in 2012 at us90.749 billion this estimate is an increase of more than us18 billion on sipris estimate of the russian military budget for 2011 us71.9 billion as of 2014 russias military budget is higher than any other european nation


 political divisionsedit 

federal subjects
according to the constitution the country comprises eighty-five federal subjects including the disputed republic of crimea and federal city of sevastopol in 1993 when the constitution was adopted there were eighty-nine federal subjects listed but later some of them were merged these subjects have equal representation—two delegates each—in the federation council however they differ in the degree of autonomy they enjoy
46 oblasts provinces most common type of federal subjects with locally elected governor and legislature
22 republics nominally autonomous each is tasked with drafting its own constitution direct-elected head of republic or a similar post and parliament republics are allowed to establish their own official language alongside russian but are represented by the federal government in international affairs republics are meant to be home to specific ethnic minorities
9 krais territories essentially the same as oblasts the territory designation is historic originally given to frontier regions and later also to the administrative divisions that comprised autonomous okrugs or autonomous oblasts
4 autonomous okrugs autonomous districts originally autonomous entities within oblasts and krais created for ethnic minorities their status was elevated to that of federal subjects in the 1990s with the exception of chukotka autonomous okrug all autonomous okrugs are still administratively subordinated to a krai or an oblast of which they are a part
1 autonomous oblast the jewish autonomous oblast historically autonomous oblasts were administrative units subordinated to krais in 1990 all of them except for the jewish ao were elevated in status to that of a republic
3 federal cities moscow saint petersburg and sevastopol major cities that function as separate regions

federal districts
federal subjects are grouped into eight federal districts each administered by an envoy appointed by the president of russia unlike the federal subjects the federal districts are not a subnational level of government but are a level of administration of the federal government federal districts envoys serve as liaisons between the federal subjects and the federal government and are primarily responsible for overseeing the compliance of the federal subjects with the federal laws


 geographyedit 

russia is the largest country in the world its total area is 17,075,200 square kilometres 6,592,800 sq mi it lies between latitudes 41° and 82° n and longitudes 19° e and 169° w
russias territorial expansion was achieved largely in the late 16th century under the cossack yermak timofeyevich during the reign of ivan the terrible at a time when competing city-states in the western regions of russia had banded together to form one country yermak mustered an army and pushed eastward where he conquered nearly all the lands once belonging to the mongols defeating their ruler khan kuchum
russia has a wide natural resource base including major deposits of timber petroleum natural gas coal ores and other mineral resources


 topographyedit 
the two most widely separated points in russia are about 8,000 km 4,971 mi apart along a geodesic line these points are a 60 km 37 mi long vistula spit the boundary with poland separating the gdańsk bay from the vistula lagoon and the most southeastern point of the kuril islands the points which are farthest separated in longitude are 6,600 km 4,101 mi apart along a geodesic line these points are in the west the same spit on the boundary with poland and in the east the big diomede island the russian federation spans 11 time zones

most of russia consists of vast stretches of plains that are predominantly steppe to the south and heavily forested to the north with tundra along the northern coast russia possesses 10% of the worlds arable land mountain ranges are found along the southern borders such as the caucasus containing mount elbrus which at 5,642 m 18,510 ft is the highest point in both russia and europe and the altai containing mount belukha which at the 4,506 m 14,783 ft is the highest point of siberia outside of the russian far east and in the eastern parts such as the verkhoyansk range or the volcanoes of kamchatka peninsula containing klyuchevskaya sopka which at the 4,750 m 15,584 ft is the highest active volcano in eurasia as well as the highest point of asian russia the ural mountains rich in mineral resources form a north-south range that divides europe and asia
russia has an extensive coastline of over 37,000 km 22,991 mi along the arctic and pacific oceans as well as along the baltic sea sea of azov black sea and caspian sea the barents sea white sea kara sea laptev sea east siberian sea chukchi sea bering sea sea of okhotsk and the sea of japan are linked to russia via the arctic and pacific russias major islands and archipelagos include novaya zemlya the franz josef land the severnaya zemlya the new siberian islands wrangel island the kuril islands and sakhalin the diomede islands one controlled by russia the other by the united states are just 3 km 1.9 mi apart and kunashir island is about 20 km 12.4 mi from hokkaido japan

russia has thousands of rivers and inland bodies of water providing it with one of the worlds largest surface water resources its lakes contain approximately one-quarter of the worlds liquid fresh water the largest and most prominent of russias bodies of fresh water is lake baikal the worlds deepest purest oldest and most capacious fresh water lake baikal alone contains over one-fifth of the worlds fresh surface water other major lakes include ladoga and onega two of the largest lakes in europe russia is second only to brazil in volume of the total renewable water resources of the countrys 100,000 rivers the volga is the most famous not only because it is the longest river in europe but also because of its major role in russian history the siberian rivers ob yenisey lena and amur are among the longest rivers in the world


 climateedit 

the enormous size of russia and the remoteness of many areas from the sea result in the dominance of the humid continental climate which is prevalent in all parts of the country except for the tundra and the extreme southeast mountains in the south obstruct the flow of warm air masses from the indian ocean while the plain of the west and north makes the country open to arctic and atlantic influences
most of northern european russia and siberia has a subarctic climate with extremely severe winters in the inner regions of northeast siberia mostly the sakha republic where the northern pole of cold is located with the record low temperature of −71.2 °c or −96.2 °f and more moderate winters elsewhere both the strip of land along the shore of the arctic ocean and the russian arctic islands have a polar climate
the coastal part of krasnodar krai on the black sea most notably in sochi possesses a humid subtropical climate with mild and wet winters in many regions of east siberia and the far east winter is dry compared to summer other parts of the country experience more even precipitation across seasons winter precipitation in most parts of the country usually falls as snow the region along the lower volga and caspian sea coast as well as some areas of southernmost siberia possesses a semi-arid climate
throughout much of the territory there are only two distinct seasons—winter and summer—as spring and autumn are usually brief periods of change between extremely low and extremely high temperatures the coldest month is january february on the coastline the warmest is usually july great ranges of temperature are typical in winter temperatures get colder both from south to north and from west to east summers can be quite hot even in siberia the continental interiors are the driest areas


 biodiversityedit 

from north to south the east european plain also known as russian plain is clad sequentially in arctic tundra coniferous forest taiga mixed and broad-leaf forests grassland steppe and semi-desert fringing the caspian sea as the changes in vegetation reflect the changes in climate siberia supports a similar sequence but is largely taiga russia has the worlds largest forest reserves known as the lungs of europe second only to the amazon rainforest in the amount of carbon dioxide it absorbs
there are 266 mammal species and 780 bird species in russia a total of 415 animal species have been included in the red data book of the russian federation as of 1997 and are now protected there are 28 unesco world heritage sites in russia 40 unesco biosphere reserves 41 national parks and 101 nature reserves


 economyedit 

russia has an upper-middle income mixed economy with enormous natural resources particularly oil and natural gas it has the 12th largest economy in the world by nominal gdp and the 6th largest by purchasing power parity ppp since the turn of the 21st century higher domestic consumption and greater political stability have bolstered economic growth in russia the country ended 2008 with its ninth straight year of growth but growth has slowed with the decline in the price of oil and gas real gdp per capita ppp current international was 19,840 in 2010 growth was primarily driven by non-traded services and goods for the domestic market as opposed to oil or mineral extraction and exports the average nominal salary in russia was 967 per month in early 2013 up from 80 in 2000 in may 2016 the average nominal monthly wages fell below 450 per month and tax on the income of individuals is payable at the rate of 13% on most incomes approximately 19.2 million of russians lived below the national poverty line in 2016 significantly up from 16.1 million in 2015 unemployment in russia was 5.4% in 2014 down from about 12.4% in 1999 officially about 20–25% of the russian population is categorized as middle class however some economists and sociologists think this figure is inflated and the real fraction is about 7 after the united states the european union and other countries imposed economic sanctions after the annexation of crimea and a collapse in oil prices the proportion of middle-class could decrease drastically

oil natural gas metals and timber account for more than 80% of russian exports abroad since 2003 the exports of natural resources started decreasing in economic importance as the internal market strengthened considerably as of 2012 the oil-and-gas sector accounted for 16% of gdp 52% of federal budget revenues and over 80% of total exports oil export earnings allowed russia to increase its foreign reserves from 12 billion in 1999 to 597.3 billion on august 1 2008 as of april 2017 foreign reserves in russia fell to 332 usd billion the macroeconomic policy under finance minister alexei kudrin was prudent and sound with excess income being stored in the stabilization fund of russia in 2006 russia repaid most of its formerly massive debts leaving it with one of the lowest foreign debts among major economies the stabilization fund helped russia to come out of the global financial crisis in a much better state than many experts had expected
a simpler more streamlined tax code adopted in 2001 reduced the tax burden on people and dramatically increased state revenue russia has a flat tax rate of 13 this ranks it as the country with the second most attractive personal tax system for single managers in the world after the united arab emirates according to bloomberg russia is considered well ahead of most other resource-rich countries in its economic development with a long tradition of education science and industry the country has a higher proportion of higher education graduates than any other country in eurasia

the economic development of the country has been uneven geographically with the moscow region contributing a very large share of the countrys gdp inequality of household income and wealth has also been noted with credit suisse finding russian wealth distribution so much more extreme than other countries studied it deserves to be placed in a separate category another problem is modernisation of infrastructure ageing and inadequate after years of being neglected in the 1990s the government has said 1 trillion will be invested in development of infrastructure by 2020 in december 2011 russia finally joined the world trade organisation allowing it a greater access to overseas markets some analysts estimate that wto membership could bring the russian economy a bounce of up to 3% annually russia ranks as the second-most corrupt country in europe after ukraine according to the corruption perceptions index the norwegian-russian chamber of commerce also states that corruption is one of the biggest problems both russian and international companies have to deal with corruption in russia is perceived as a significant problem impacting all aspects of life including public administration law enforcement healthcare and education the phenomenon of corruption is strongly established in the historical model of public governance in russia and attributed to general weakness of rule of law in russia according to 2016 results of corruption perception index of transparency international russia ranked 131th place out of 176 countries with score 29
there are many different estimates of the actual cost of corruption according to official government statistics from rosstat the shadow economy occupied only 15% of russias gdp in 2011 and this included unreported salaries to avoid taxes and social payments and other types of tax evasion according to rosstats estimates corruption in 2011 amounted to only 3.5 to 7% of gdp in comparison some independent experts maintain that corruption consumes as much of 25% of russias gdp a world bank report puts this figure at 48 there is also an interesting shift in the main focus of bribery whereas previously officials took bribes to shut their eyes to legal infractions they now take them simply to perform their duties many experts admit that in recent years corruption in russia has become a business in the 1990s businessmen had to pay different criminal groups to provide a krysha literally a roof ie protection nowadays this protective function is performed by officials corrupt hierarchies characterize different sectors of the economy including education
in the end the russian population pays for this corruption for example some experts believe that the rapid increases in tariffs for housing water gas and electricity which significantly outpace the rate of inflation are a direct result of high volumes of corruption at the highest levels in the recent years the reaction to corruption has changed starting from putins second term very few corruption cases have been the subject of outrage putins system is remarkable for its ubiquitous and open merging of the civil service and business as well as its use of relatives friends and acquaintances to benefit from budgetary expenditures and take over state property corporate property and land raiding is commonplace
on march 26 2017 protests against alleged corruption in the federal russian government took place simultaneously in many cities across the country they were triggered by the lack of proper response from the russian authorities to the published investigative film he is not dimon to you which has garnered more than 20 million views on youtube a new wave of mass protests has been announced for june 12 2017

the russian central bank announced plans in 2013 to free float the russian ruble in 2015 according to a stress test conducted by the central bank russian financial system would be able to handle a currency decline of 25–30% without major central bank interference however the russian economy began stagnating in late 2013 and in combination with the war in donbass is in danger of entering stagflation slow growth and high inflation the recent decline in the russian ruble has increased the costs for russian companies to make interest payments on debt issued in us dollar or other foreign currencies that have strengthened against the ruble thus it costs russian companies more of their ruble-denominated revenue to repay their debt holders in dollars or other foreign currencies as of march 2016 the ruble was devalued more than 50 percent since july 2014 moreover after bringing inflation down to 3.6% in 2012 the lowest rate since gaining independence from the soviet union inflation in russia jumped to nearly 7.5% in 2014 causing the central bank to increase its lending rate to 8% from 5.5% in 2013 in an october 2014 article in bloomberg business week it was reported that russia had significantly started shifting its economy towards china in response to increasing financial tensions following its annexation of crimea and subsequent western economic sanctions


 agricultureedit 

russias total area of cultivated land is estimated at 1,237,294 square kilometres 477,722 sq mi the fourth largest in the world from 1999 to 2009 russias agriculture grew steadily and the country turned from a grain importer to the third largest grain exporter after the eu and the united states the production of meat has grown from 6,813,000 tonnes in 1999 to 9,331,000 tonnes in 2008 and continues to grow
this restoration of agriculture was supported by a credit policy of the government helping both individual farmers and large privatized corporate farms that once were soviet kolkhozes and which still own the significant share of agricultural land while large farms concentrate mainly on grain production and husbandry products small private household plots produce most of the countrys potatoes vegetables and fruits
since russia borders three oceans the atlantic arctic and pacific russian fishing fleets are a major world fish supplier russia captured 3,191,068 tons of fish in 2005 both exports and imports of fish and sea products grew significantly in recent years reaching 2,415 and 2,036 million respectively in 2008
sprawling from the baltic sea to the pacific ocean russia has more than a fifth of the worlds forests which makes it the largest forest country in the world however according to a 2012 study by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations and the government of the russian federation the considerable potential of russian forests is underutilized and russias share of the global trade in forest products is less than four percent


 energyedit 

in recent years russia has frequently been described in the media as an energy superpower the country has the worlds largest natural gas reserves the 8th largest oil reserves and the second largest coal reserves russia is the worlds leading natural gas exporter and second largest natural gas producer while also the largest oil exporter and the largest oil producer
russia is the 3rd largest electricity producer in the world and the 5th largest renewable energy producer the latter because of the well-developed hydroelectricity production in the country large cascades of hydropower plants are built in european russia along big rivers like the volga the asian part of russia also features a number of major hydropower stations however the gigantic hydroelectric potential of siberia and the russian far east largely remains unexploited
russia was the first country to develop civilian nuclear power and to construct the worlds first nuclear power plant currently the country is the 4th largest nuclear energy producer with all nuclear power in russia being managed by rosatom state corporation the sector is rapidly developing with an aim of increasing the total share of nuclear energy from current 16.9% to 23% by 2020 the russian government plans to allocate 127 billion rubles 5.42 billion to a federal program dedicated to the next generation of nuclear energy technology about 1 trillion rubles 42.7 billion is to be allocated from the federal budget to nuclear power and industry development before 2015
in may 2014 on a two-day trip to shanghai president putin signed a deal on behalf of gazprom for the russian energy giant to supply china with 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year construction of a pipeline to facilitate the deal was agreed whereby russia would contribute 55bn to the cost and china 22bn in what putin described as the worlds biggest construction project for the next four years the natural gas would begin to flow sometime between 2018 and 2020 and would continue for 30 years at an ultimate cost to china of 400bn


 transportedit 

railway transport in russia is mostly under the control of the state-run russian railways monopoly the company accounts for over 3.6% of russias gdp and handles 39% of the total freight traffic including pipelines and more than 42% of passenger traffic the total length of common-used railway tracks exceeds 85,500 km 53,127 mi second only to the united states over 44,000 km 27,340 mi of tracks are electrified which is the largest number in the world and additionally there are more than 30,000 km 18,641 mi of industrial non-common carrier lines railways in russia unlike in the most of the world use broad gauge of 1,520 mm 4 ft 11 27⁄32 in with the exception of 957 km 595 mi on sakhalin island using narrow gauge of 1,067 mm 3 ft 6 in the most renowned railway in russia is trans-siberian transsib spanning a record 7 time zones and serving the longest single continuous services in the world moscow-vladivostok 9,259 km 5,753 mi moscow–pyongyang 10,267 km 6,380 mi and kiev–vladivostok 11,085 km 6,888 mi
as of 2006 russia had 933,000 km of roads of which 755,000 were paved some of these make up the russian federal motorway system with a large land area the road density is the lowest of all the g8 and bric countries
much of russias inland waterways which total 102,000 km 63,380 mi are made up of natural rivers or lakes in the european part of the country the network of channels connects the basins of major rivers russias capital moscow is sometimes called the port of the five seas because of its waterway connections to the baltic white caspian azov and black seas

major sea ports of russia include rostov-on-don on the azov sea novorossiysk on the black sea astrakhan and makhachkala on the caspian kaliningrad and st petersburg on the baltic arkhangelsk on the white sea murmansk on the barents sea petropavlovsk-kamchatsky and vladivostok on the pacific ocean in 2008 the country owned 1,448 merchant marine ships the worlds only fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers advances the economic exploitation of the arctic continental shelf of russia and the development of sea trade through the northern sea route between europe and east asia
by total length of pipelines russia is second only to the united states currently many new pipeline projects are being realized including nord stream and south stream natural gas pipelines to europe and the eastern siberia – pacific ocean oil pipeline espo to the russian far east and china
russia has 1,216 airports the busiest being sheremetyevo domodedovo and vnukovo in moscow and pulkovo in st petersburg
typically major russian cities have well-developed systems of public transport with the most common varieties of exploited vehicles being bus trolleybus and tram seven russian cities namely moscow saint petersburg nizhny novgorod novosibirsk samara yekaterinburg and kazan have underground metros while volgograd features a metrotram the total length of metros in russia is 465.4 kilometres 289.2 mi moscow metro and saint petersburg metro are the oldest in russia opened in 1935 and 1955 respectively these two are among the fastest and busiest metro systems in the world and some of them are famous for rich decorations and unique designs of their stations which is a common tradition in russian metros and railways


 science and technologyedit 

science and technology in russia blossomed since the age of enlightenment when peter the great founded the russian academy of sciences and saint petersburg state university and polymath mikhail lomonosov established the moscow state university paving the way for a strong native tradition in learning and innovation in the 19th and 20th centuries the country produced a large number of notable scientists and inventors
the russian physics school began with lomonosov who proposed the law of conservation of matter preceding the energy conservation law russian discoveries and inventions in physics include the electric arc electrodynamical lenzs law space groups of crystals photoelectric cell superfluidity cherenkov radiation electron paramagnetic resonance heterotransistors and 3d holography lasers and masers were co-invented by nikolai basov and alexander prokhorov while the idea of tokamak for controlled nuclear fusion was introduced by igor tamm andrei sakharov and lev artsimovich leading eventually the modern international iter project where russia is a party
since the time of nikolay lobachevsky the copernicus of geometry who pioneered the non-euclidean geometry and a prominent tutor pafnuty chebyshev the russian mathematical school became one of the most influential in the world chebyshevs students included aleksandr lyapunov who founded the modern stability theory and andrey markov who invented the markov chains in the 20th century soviet mathematicians such as andrey kolmogorov israel gelfand and sergey sobolev made major contributions to various areas of mathematics nine sovietrussian mathematicians were awarded with the fields medal a most prestigious award in mathematics recently grigori perelman was offered the first ever clay millennium prize problems award for his final proof of the poincaré conjecture in 2002
russian chemist dmitry mendeleev invented the periodic table the main framework of modern chemistry aleksandr butlerov was one of the creators of the theory of chemical structure playing a central role in organic chemistry russian biologists include dmitry ivanovsky who discovered viruses ivan pavlov who was the first to experiment with the classical conditioning and ilya mechnikov who was a pioneer researcher of the immune system and probiotics
many russian scientists and inventors were émigrés like igor sikorsky who built the first airliners and modern-type helicopters vladimir zworykin often called the father of tv chemist ilya prigogine noted for his work on dissipative structures and complex systems nobel prize-winning economists simon kuznets and wassily leontief physicist georgiy gamov an author of the big bang theory and social scientist pitirim sorokin many foreigners worked in russia for a long time like leonard euler and alfred nobel
russian inventions include arc welding by nikolay benardos further developed by nikolay slavyanov konstantin khrenov and other russian engineers gleb kotelnikov invented the knapsack parachute while evgeniy chertovsky introduced the pressure suit alexander lodygin and pavel yablochkov were pioneers of electric lighting and mikhail dolivo-dobrovolsky introduced the first three-phase electric power systems widely used today sergei lebedev invented the first commercially viable and mass-produced type of synthetic rubber the first ternary computer setun was developed by nikolay brusentsov

in the 20th century a number of prominent soviet aerospace engineers inspired by the fundamental works of nikolai zhukovsky sergei chaplygin and others designed many hundreds of models of military and civilian aircraft and founded a number of kbs construction bureaus that now constitute the bulk of russian united aircraft corporation famous russian aircraft include the civilian tu-series su and mig fighter aircraft ka and mi-series helicopters many russian aircraft models are on the list of most produced aircraft in history
famous russian battle tanks include t34 the most heavily produced tank design of world war ii and further tanks of t-series including the most produced tank in history t54/55 the ak47 and ak74 by mikhail kalashnikov constitute the most widely used type of assault rifle throughout the world—so much so that more ak-type rifles have been manufactured than all other assault rifles combined
with all these achievements however since the late soviet era russia was lagging behind the west in a number of technologies mostly those related to energy conservation and consumer goods production the crisis of the 1990s led to the drastic reduction of the state support for science and a brain drain migration from russia
in the 2000s on the wave of a new economic boom the situation in the russian science and technology has improved and the government launched a campaign aimed into modernisation and innovation russian president dmitry medvedev formulated top priorities for the countrys technological development
efficient energy use
information technology including both common products and the products combined with space technology
nuclear energy
pharmaceuticals
currently russia has completed the glonass satellite navigation system the country is developing its own fifth-generation jet fighter and constructing the first serial mobile nuclear plant in the world


 space explorationedit 
russian achievements in the field of space technology and space exploration are traced back to konstantin tsiolkovsky the father of theoretical astronautics his works had inspired leading soviet rocket engineers such as sergey korolyov valentin glushko and many others who contributed to the success of the soviet space program in the early stages of the space race and beyond
in 1957 the first earth-orbiting artificial satellite sputnik 1 was launched in 1961 the first human trip into space was successfully made by yury gagarin many other soviet and russian space exploration records ensued including the first spacewalk performed by alexey leonov luna 9 was the first spacecraft to land on the moon venera 7 was the first to land on another planet venus mars 3 then the first to land on mars the first space exploration rover lunokhod 1 and the first space station salyut 1 and mir
after the collapse of the soviet union some government-funded space exploration programs including the buran space shuttle program were cancelled or delayed while participation of the russian space industry in commercial activities and international cooperation intensified nowadays russia is the largest satellite launcher after the united states space shuttle program ended in 2011 soyuz rockets became the only provider of transport for astronauts at the international space station


 water supply and sanitationedit 

in russia approximately 70 per cent of drinking water comes from surface water and 30 per cent from groundwater in 2004 water supply systems had a total capacity of 90 million cubic metres a day the average residential water use was 248 litres per capita per day one fourth of the worlds fresh surface and groundwater is located in russia the water utilities sector is one of the largest industries in russia serving the entire russian population


 demographicsedit 

ethnic russians comprise 81% of the countrys population the russian federation is also home to several sizeable minorities in all 160 different other ethnic groups and indigenous peoples live within its borders though russias population is comparatively large its density is low because of the countrys enormous size population is densest in european russia near the ural mountains and in southwest siberia 73% of the population lives in urban areas while 27% in rural ones the results of the 2010 census show a total population of 142,856,536
russias population peaked at 148,689,000 in 1991 just before the dissolution of the soviet union it began to experience a rapid decline starting in the mid-1990s the decline has slowed to near stagnation in recent years because of reduced death rates increased birth rates and increased immigration

 religionedit 

russians have practised orthodox christianity since the 10th century according to the historical traditions of the orthodox church christianity was first brought to the territory of modern belarus russia and ukraine by saint andrew the first apostle of jesus christ following the primary chronicle the definitive christianization of kievan rus dates from the year 988 the year is disputed when vladimir the great was baptized in chersonesus and proceeded to baptize his family and people in kiev the latter events are traditionally referred to as the baptism of rus russian крещение руси ukrainian хрещення русі in russian and ukrainian literature much of the russian population like other slavic peoples preserved for centuries a double belief dvoeverie in both indigenous religion and orthodox christianity
at the time of the 1917 revolution the russian orthodox church was deeply integrated into the autocratic state enjoying official status this was a significant factor that contributed to the bolshevik attitude to religion and the steps they took to control it bolsheviks consisted of many people with non-russian communist russians and influential jewish backgrounds such as vladimir lenin leon trotsky grigory zinoviev lev kamenev grigori sokolnikov who were indifferent towards christianity and based on the writings of jewish philosopher karl marx with marxism–leninism as an ideology went on to form the communist party
thus the ussr became one of the first communist states to proclaim as an ideological objective the elimination of religion and its replacement with universal atheism the communist government ridiculed religions and their believers and propagated atheism in schools the confiscation of religious assets was often based on accusations of illegal accumulation of wealth
state atheism in the soviet union was known in russian as gosateizm and was based on the ideology of marxism–leninism marxist–leninist atheism has consistently advocated the control suppression and elimination of religion within about a year of the revolution the state expropriated all church property including the churches themselves and in the period from 1922 to 1926 28 russian orthodox bishops and more than 1,200 priests were killed many more were persecuted after the collapse of the soviet union there has been a renewal of religions in russia and among slavs various movements have emerged besides christianity including rodnovery slavic native faith ringing cedars anastasianism hinduism siberian shamanism and other religions
currently there is no official census of religion in russia and estimates are based on surveys only in 2012 the research organization sreda published arena atlas a detailed enumeration of religious populations and nationalities in russia based on a large-sample country-wide survey they found that 46.8% of russians declared themselves christians including 41% russian orthodox 1.5% simply orthodox or members of non-russian orthodox churches 4.1% unaffiliated christians and less than 1% for both catholic and protestant while 25% were spiritual but not religious 13% were atheists 6.5% were muslims 1.2% were followers of traditional religions honoring gods and ancestors including rodnovery tengrism and other ethnic religions and 0.5% were tibetan buddhists however later that year the levada center estimated that 76% of russians were christians and in june 2013 the public opinion foundation estimated that 65% of the population was christian these findings are in line with pew research centers 2011 estimate that 73.6% of russians were christians with russian public opinion research center vcioms 2010 survey 77% christian and with ipsos moris 2011 survey 69
the most recent pew research center finding was that in 2015 71% of the population of russia declared itself eastern orthodox 15% religiously unaffiliated—a category which includes atheists agnostics and those who describe their religion as “nothing in particular” 10% muslim and 2% other christians while 1% belonged to other faiths the religiously unaffiliated divided between 4% as atheists 1% as agnostics and 10% as nothing in particular the study cited that during the communist era the government repression of religion was widespread and due to the soviet anti-religious legislation in 1991 37% of the population of russia was eastern orthodox after the dissolution of the soviet union the affiliation to the eastern orthodox church have risen substantially and in 2015 about 71% of the population of russia declared itself to be eastern orthodox and the share of who identitied as religiously unaffiliated declined from a 61% in 1991 to 18% in 2008

orthodox christianity islam judaism buddhism and ethnic religions are recognised as russias traditional religions marking the countrys historical heritage
traced back to the christianization of kievan rus in the 10th century russian orthodoxy is the dominant religion in the country smaller christian denominations such as catholics armenian gregorians and various protestant churches also exist the russian orthodox church was the countrys state religion prior to the revolution and remains the largest religious body in the country an estimated 95% of the registered orthodox parishes belong to the russian orthodox church while there are a number of smaller orthodox churches however the vast majority of orthodox believers do not attend church on a regular basis easter is the most popular religious holiday in russia celebrated by a large segment of the russian population including large numbers of those who are non-religious more than three-quarters of the russian population celebrate easter by making traditional easter cakes coloured eggs and paskha

islam is the second largest religion in russia after russian orthodoxy it is the traditional or predominant religion amongst some caucasian ethnicities notably the chechens the ingush and the circassians and amongst some turkic peoples notably the tatars and the bashkirs
buddhism is traditional in three regions of the russian federation buryatia tuva and kalmykia according to various reports the proportion of not religious people in russia is between 16% and 48% of the population according to recent studies the proportion of atheists has significantly decreased over the decades after the dissolution of the soviet union
in cultural and social affairs vladimir putin has collaborated closely with the russian orthodox church patriarch kirill of moscow head of the church endorsed his election in 2012 steven myers reports the church once heavily repressed had emerged from the soviet collapse as one of the most respected institutions now kiril led the faithful directly into an alliance with the state mark woods provides specific examples of how the church under patriarch kirill of moscow has backed the expansion of russian power into crimea and eastern ukraine more broadly the new york times reports in september 2016 how that churchs policy prescriptions support the kremlins appeal to social conservatives
a fervent foe of homosexuality and any attempt to put individual rights above those of family community or nation the russian orthodox church helps project russia as the natural ally of all those who pine for a more secure illiberal world free from the tradition-crushing rush of globalization multiculturalism and womens and gay rights
on april 26 2017 for the first time the us commission on international religious freedom classified russia as one of the worlds worst violators of religious liberty recommending in its 2017 annual report that the us government deem russia a country of particular concern under the international religious freedom act and negotiate for religious liberty the report states —it is the sole state to have not only continually intensified its repression of religious freedom since uscirf commenced monitoring it but also to have expanded its repressive policiesranging from administrative harassment to arbitrary imprisonment to extrajudicial killing are implemented in a fashion that is systematic ongoing and egregious on april 4 2017 un special rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression david kaye un special rapporteur on freedoms of peaceful assembly and association maina kiai and un special rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief ahmed shaheed condemned russias treatment of jehovahs witnesses many other countries and international organizations have spoken out on russias religious abuses


 healthedit 

the russian constitution guarantees free universal health care for all its citizens in practice however free health care is partially restricted because of mandatory registration while russia has more physicians hospitals and health care workers than almost any other country in the world on a per capita basis since the dissolution of the soviet union the health of the russian population has declined considerably as a result of social economic and lifestyle changes the trend has been reversed only in the recent years with average life expectancy having increased 5.2 years for males and 3.1 years for females between 2006 and 2014
due to the ongoing russian financial crisis since 2014 major cuts in health spending have resulted in a decline in the quality of service of the state healthcare system about 40% of basic medical facilities have fewer staff than they are supposed to have with others being closed down waiting times for treatment have increased and patients have been forced to pay for more services that were previously free
as of 2014 the average life expectancy in russia was 65.29 years for males and 76.49 years for females the biggest factor contributing to the relatively low life expectancy for males is a high mortality rate among working-age males deaths mostly occur from preventable causes including alcohol poisoning smoking traffic accidents and violent crime as a result russia has one of the worlds most female-biased sex ratios with 0.859 males to every female

with the change in values imposed by communist ideology the tradition of preservation was broken independent preservation societies even those that defended only secular landmarks such as moscow-based oiru were disbanded by the end of the 1920s a new anti-religious campaign launched in 1929 coincided with collectivization of peasants destruction of churches in the cities peaked around 1932 a number of churches were demolished including the cathedral of christ the saviour in moscow in moscow alone losses of 1917–2006 are estimated at over 640 notable buildings including 150 to 200 listed buildings out of a total inventory of 3,500 – some disappeared completely others were replaced with concrete replicas
in 1955 a new soviet leader nikita khrushchev condemned the excesses of the former academic architecture and the late soviet era was dominated by plain functionalism in architecture this helped somewhat to resolve the housing problem but created a large quantity of buildings of low architectural quality much in contrast with the previous bright styles in 1959 nikita khrushchev launched his anti-religious campaign by 1964 over 10 thousand churches out of 20 thousand were shut down mostly in rural areas and many were demolished of 58 monasteries and convents operating in 1959 only sixteen remained by 1964 of moscows fifty churches operating in 1959 thirty were closed and six demolished
