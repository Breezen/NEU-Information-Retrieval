classical mechanics describes the motion of macroscopic objects from projectiles to parts of machinery and astronomical objects such as spacecraft planets stars and galaxies
if the present state of an object is known it is possible to predict by the laws of classical mechanics how it will move in the future determinism and how it has moved in the past reversibility
the earliest development of classical mechanics is often referred to as newtonian mechanics it consists of the physical concepts employed by and the mathematical methods invented by isaac newton and gottfried wilhelm leibniz and others in the 17th century to describe the motion of bodies under the influence of a system of forces
later more abstract methods were developed leading to the reformulations of classical mechanics known as lagrangian mechanics and hamiltonian mechanics these advances made predominantly in the 18th and 19th centuries extend substantially beyond newtons work particularly through their use of analytical mechanics they are with some modification also used in all areas of modern physics
classical mechanics provides extremely accurate results when studying large objects that are not extremely heavy and speeds not approaching the speed of light when the objects being examined have about the size of an atom diameter it becomes necessary to introduce the other major sub-field of mechanics quantum mechanics to describe velocities that are not small compared to the speed of light special relativity is needed in case that objects become extremely heavy general relativity becomes applicable however a number of modern sources do include relativistic mechanics into classical physics which in their view represents classical mechanics in its most developed and accurate form


 description of the theory 

the following introduces the basic concepts of classical mechanics for simplicity it often models real-world objects as point particles objects with negligible size the motion of a point particle is characterized by a small number of parameters its position mass and the forces applied to it each of these parameters is discussed in turn
in reality the kind of objects that classical mechanics can describe always have a non-zero size the physics of very small particles such as the electron is more accurately described by quantum mechanics objects with non-zero size have more complicated behavior than hypothetical point particles because of the additional degrees of freedom eg a baseball can spin while it is moving however the results for point particles can be used to study such objects by treating them as composite objects made of a large number of collectively acting point particles the center of mass of a composite object behaves like a point particle
classical mechanics uses common-sense notions of how matter and forces exist and interact it assumes that matter and energy have definite knowable attributes such as location in space and speed non-relativistic mechanics also assumes that forces act instantaneously see also action at a distance


 position and its derivatives 

the position of a point particle is defined in relation to a coordinate system centered on an arbitrary fixed reference point in space called the origin o a simple coordinate system might describe the position of a particle p with a vector notated by an arrow labeled r that points from the origin o to point p in general the point particle does not need to be stationary relative to o in cases where p is moving relative to o r is defined as a function of t time in pre-einstein relativity known as galilean relativity time is considered an absolute ie the time interval that is observed to elapse between any given pair of events is the same for all observers in addition to relying on absolute time classical mechanics assumes euclidean geometry for the structure of space


 velocity and speed 

the velocity or the rate of change of position with time is defined as the derivative of the position with respect to time

  
    
      
        
          v

in classical mechanics velocities are directly additive and subtractive for example if one car travels east at 60 kmh and passes another car traveling in the same direction at 50 kmh the slower car perceives the faster car as traveling east at 60 − 50  10 kmh however from the perspective of the faster car the slower car is moving 10 kmh to the west often denoted as -10 kmh where the sign implies opposite direction velocities are directly additive as vector quantities they must be dealt with using vector analysis
mathematically if the velocity of the first object in the previous discussion is denoted by the vector u  ud and the velocity of the second object by the vector v  ve where u is the speed of the first object v is the speed of the second object and d and e are unit vectors in the directions of motion of each object respectively then the velocity of the first object as seen by the second object is

  
    
      
        
          
            u

          v
        
        
        
      
    
    displaystyle mathbf u mathbf u -mathbf v 
  
similarly the first object sees the velocity of the second object as

  
    
      
        
          
            v
            ′
          
        
        
        
          v
        
        −
        
          u
        
        
        
      
    
    displaystyle mathbf v mathbf v -mathbf u 
  
when both objects are moving in the same direction this equation can be simplified to

  
    
      
        
          
            u
          
          ′

    displaystyle mathbf u u-vmathbf d 
  
or by ignoring direction the difference can be given in terms of speed only

  
    
      
        
          u
          ′

acceleration represents the velocitys change over time velocity can change in either magnitude or direction or both occasionally a decrease in the magnitude of velocity v is referred to as deceleration but generally any change in the velocity over time including deceleration is simply referred to as acceleration


 frames of reference 

while the position velocity and acceleration of a particle can be described with respect to any observer in any state of motion classical mechanics assumes the existence of a special family of reference frames in which the mechanical laws of nature take a comparatively simple form these special reference frames are called inertial frames
an inertial frame is a frame of reference within which an object interacting with no forces an idealized situation appears either at rest or moving uniformly in a straight line this is the fundamental definition of an inertial frame these are characterized by the requirement that all forces entering the observers physical laws originate from identifiable sources caused by fields such as electro-static field caused by static electrical charges electro-magnetic field caused by moving charges gravitational field caused by mass and so forth
a key concept of inertial frames is the method for identifying them for practical purposes reference frames that do not accelerate with respect to distant stars an extremely distant point are regarded as good approximations to inertial frames non-inertial reference frames accelerate in relation to an existing inertial frame they form the basis for einsteins relativity due to the relative motion particles in the non-inertial frame appear to move in ways not explained by forces from existing fields in the reference frame hence it appears that there are other forces that enter the equations of motion solely as a result of the relative acceleration these forces are referred to as fictitious forces inertia forces or pseudo-forces
consider two reference frames s and s for observers in each of the reference frames an event has space-time coordinates of xyzt in frame s and xyzt in frame s assuming time is measured the same in all reference frames and if we require x  x when t  0 then the relation between the space-time coordinates of the same event observed from the reference frames s and s which are moving at a relative velocity of u in the x direction is

this set of formulas defines a group transformation known as the galilean transformation informally the galilean transform this group is a limiting case of the poincaré group used in special relativity the limiting case applies when the velocity u is very small compared to c the speed of light
the transformations have the following consequences
v′  v − u the velocity v′ of a particle from the perspective of s′ is slower by u than its velocity v from the perspective of s
a′  a the acceleration of a particle is the same in any inertial reference frame
f′  f the force on a particle is the same in any inertial reference frame
the speed of light is not a constant in classical mechanics nor does the special position given to the speed of light in relativistic mechanics have a counterpart in classical mechanics
for some problems it is convenient to use rotating coordinates reference frames thereby one can either keep a mapping to a convenient inertial frame or introduce additionally a fictitious centrifugal force and coriolis force

newton was the first to mathematically express the relationship between force and momentum some physicists interpret newtons second law of motion as a definition of force and mass while others consider it a fundamental postulate a law of nature either interpretation has the same mathematical consequences historically known as newtons second law

where v0 is the initial velocity this means that the velocity of this particle decays exponentially to zero as time progresses in this case an equivalent viewpoint is that the kinetic energy of the particle is absorbed by friction which converts it to heat energy in accordance with the conservation of energy and the particle is slowing down this expression can be further integrated to obtain the position r of the particle as a function of time
important forces include the gravitational force and the lorentz force for electromagnetism in addition newtons third law can sometimes be used to deduce the forces acting on a particle if it is known that particle a exerts a force f on another particle b it follows that b must exert an equal and opposite reaction force −f on a the strong form of newtons third law requires that f and −f act along the line connecting a and b while the weak form does not illustrations of the weak form of newtons third law are often found for magnetic forces

is constant in time it is often useful because many commonly encountered forces are conservative


 beyond newtons laws 
classical mechanics also describes the more complex motions of extended non-pointlike objects eulers laws provide extensions to newtons laws in this area the concepts of angular momentum rely on the same calculus used to describe one-dimensional motion the rocket equation extends the notion of rate of change of an objects momentum to include the effects of an object losing mass
there are two important alternative formulations of classical mechanics lagrangian mechanics and hamiltonian mechanics these and other modern formulations usually bypass the concept of force instead referring to other physical quantities such as energy speed and momentum for describing mechanical systems in generalized coordinates
the expressions given above for momentum and kinetic energy are only valid when there is no significant electromagnetic contribution in electromagnetism newtons second law for current-carrying wires breaks down unless one includes the electromagnetic field contribution to the momentum of the system as expressed by the poynting vector divided by c2 where c is the speed of light in free space


 limits of validity 

many branches of classical mechanics are simplifications or approximations of more accurate forms two of the most accurate being general relativity and relativistic statistical mechanics geometric optics is an approximation to the quantum theory of light and does not have a superior classical form
when both quantum mechanics and classical mechanics cannot apply such as at the quantum level with many degrees of freedom quantum field theory qft is of use qft deals with small distances and large speeds with many degrees of freedom as well as the possibility of any change in the number of particles throughout the interaction when treating large degrees of freedom at the macroscopic level statistical mechanics becomes useful statistical mechanics describes the behavior of large but countable numbers of particles and their interactions as a whole at the macroscopic level statistical mechanics is mainly used in thermodynamics for systems that lie outside the bounds of the assumptions of classical thermodynamics in the case of high velocity objects approaching the speed of light classical mechanics is enhanced by special relativity in case that objects become extremely heavy ie their schwarzschild radius is not negligibly small for a given application deviations from newtonian mechanics become apparent and can be quantified by using the parameterized post-newtonian formalism in that case general relativity gr becomes applicable however until now there is no theory of quantum gravity unifying gr and qft in the sense that it could be used when objects become extremely small and heavy45


 the newtonian approximation to special relativity 
in special relativity the momentum of a particle is given by

  
    
      
        
          p

                v
              
            
            
              1
              −
              
                v
                
                  2
                
              
              
                
              
              
                c
                
                  2
                
              
            
          
        
        
        
      
    
    displaystyle mathbf p frac mmathbf v sqrt 1-v2c2
  
where m is the particles rest mass v its velocity and c is the speed of light
if v is very small compared to c v2c2 is approximately zero and so

  
    
      
        
          p
        
        ≈
        m
        
          v
        
        
        
      
    
    displaystyle mathbf p approx mmathbf v 
  
thus the newtonian equation p  mv is an approximation of the relativistic equation for bodies moving with low speeds compared to the speed of light
for example the relativistic cyclotron frequency of a cyclotron gyrotron or high voltage magnetron is given by

  
    
      
        f
        
        
          f

              m
              
                0
              
            
            
              
                m
                
                  0
                
              
              
              t
              
                
              
              
                c
                
                  2
                
              
            
          
        
        
        
      
    
    displaystyle ffmathrm c frac m0m0tc2
  
where fc is the classical frequency of an electron or other charged particle with kinetic energy t and rest mass m0 circling in a magnetic field the rest mass of an electron is 511 kev so the frequency correction is 1% for a magnetic vacuum tube with a 5.11 kv direct current accelerating voltage


 the classical approximation to quantum mechanics 
the ray approximation of classical mechanics breaks down when the de broglie wavelength is not much smaller than other dimensions of the system for non-relativistic particles this wavelength is

  
    
      
        λ
        
        
          
            h
            p
          
        
      
    
    displaystyle lambda frac hp
  
where h is plancks constant and p is the momentum
again this happens with electrons before it happens with heavier particles for example the electrons used by clinton davisson and lester germer in 1927 accelerated by 54 volts had a wavelength of 0.167 nm which was long enough to exhibit a single diffraction side lobe when reflecting from the face of a nickel crystal with atomic spacing of 0.215 nm with a larger vacuum chamber it would seem relatively easy to increase the angular resolution from around a radian to a milliradian and see quantum diffraction from the periodic patterns of integrated circuit computer memory
more practical examples of the failure of classical mechanics on an engineering scale are conduction by quantum tunneling in tunnel diodes and very narrow transistor gates in integrated circuits
classical mechanics is the same extreme high frequency approximation as geometric optics it is more often accurate because it describes particles and bodies with rest mass these have more momentum and therefore shorter de broglie wavelengths than massless particles such as light with the same kinetic energies


 history 

the study of the motion of bodies is an ancient one making classical mechanics one of the oldest and largest subjects in science engineering and technology
some greek philosophers of antiquity among them aristotle founder of aristotelian physics may have been the first to maintain the idea that everything happens for a reason and that theoretical principles can assist in the understanding of nature while to a modern reader many of these preserved ideas come forth as eminently reasonable there is a conspicuous lack of both mathematical theory and controlled experiment as we know it these later became decisive factors in forming modern science and their early application came to be known as classical mechanics
in his elementa super demonstrationem ponderum medieval mathematician jordanus de nemore introduced the concept of positional gravity and the use of component forces

the first published causal explanation of the motions of planets was johannes keplers astronomia nova published in 1609 he concluded based on tycho brahes observations on the orbit of mars that the planets orbits were ellipses this break with ancient thought was happening around the same time that galileo was proposing abstract mathematical laws for the motion of objects he may or may not have performed the famous experiment of dropping two cannonballs of different weights from the tower of pisa showing that they both hit the ground at the same time the reality of that particular experiment is disputed but he did carry out quantitative experiments by rolling balls on an inclined plane his theory of accelerated motion was derived from the results of such experiments and forms a cornerstone of classical mechanics

newton founded his principles of natural philosophy on three proposed laws of motion the law of inertia his second law of acceleration mentioned above and the law of action and reaction and hence laid the foundations for classical mechanics both newtons second and third laws were given the proper scientific and mathematical treatment in newtons philosophiæ naturalis principia mathematica here they are distinguished from earlier attempts at explaining similar phenomena which were either incomplete incorrect or given little accurate mathematical expression newton also enunciated the principles of conservation of momentum and angular momentum in mechanics newton was also the first to provide the first correct scientific and mathematical formulation of gravity in newtons law of universal gravitation the combination of newtons laws of motion and gravitation provide the fullest and most accurate description of classical mechanics he demonstrated that these laws apply to everyday objects as well as to celestial objects in particular he obtained a theoretical explanation of keplers laws of motion of the planets
newton had previously invented the calculus of mathematics and used it to perform the mathematical calculations for acceptability his book the principia was formulated entirely in terms of the long-established geometric methods which were soon eclipsed by his calculus however it was leibniz who developed the notation of the derivative and integral preferred today

newton and most of his contemporaries with the notable exception of huygens worked on the assumption that classical mechanics would be able to explain all phenomena including light in the form of geometric optics even when discovering the so-called newtons rings a wave interference phenomenon he maintained his own corpuscular theory of light
after newton classical mechanics became a principal field of study in mathematics as well as physics several re-formulations progressively allowed finding solutions to a far greater number of problems the first notable re-formulation was in 1788 by joseph louis lagrange lagrangian mechanics was in turn re-formulated in 1833 by william rowan hamilton
some difficulties were discovered in the late 19th century that could only be resolved by more modern physics some of these difficulties related to compatibility with electromagnetic theory and the famous michelson–morley experiment the resolution of these problems led to the special theory of relativity often still considered a part of classical mechanics
a second set of difficulties were related to thermodynamics when combined with thermodynamics classical mechanics leads to the gibbs paradox of classical statistical mechanics in which entropy is not a well-defined quantity black-body radiation was not explained without the introduction of quanta as experiments reached the atomic level classical mechanics failed to explain even approximately such basic things as the energy levels and sizes of atoms and the photo-electric effect the effort at resolving these problems led to the development of quantum mechanics
since the end of the 20th century classical mechanics in physics has no longer been an independent theory instead classical mechanics is now considered an approximate theory to the more general quantum mechanics emphasis has shifted to understanding the fundamental forces of nature as in the standard model and its more modern extensions into a unified theory of everything classical mechanics is a theory useful for the study of the motion of non-quantum mechanical low-energy particles in weak gravitational fields also it has been extended into the complex domain where complex classical mechanics exhibits behaviors very similar to quantum mechanics


 branches 
classical mechanics was traditionally divided into three main branches
statics the study of equilibrium and its relation to forces
dynamics the study of motion and its relation to forces
kinematics dealing with the implications of observed motions without regard for circumstances causing them
another division is based on the choice of mathematical formalism
newtonian mechanics
lagrangian mechanics
hamiltonian mechanics
alternatively a division can be made by region of application
celestial mechanics relating to stars planets and other celestial bodies
continuum mechanics for materials modelled as a continuum eg solids and fluids ie liquids and gases
relativistic mechanics ie including the special and general theories of relativity for bodies whose speed is close to the speed of light
statistical mechanics which provides a framework for relating the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic or bulk thermodynamic properties of materials
