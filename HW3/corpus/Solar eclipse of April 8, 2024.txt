 solar eclipses 2022–2025 
each member in a semester series of solar eclipses repeats approximately every 177 days and 4 hours a semester at alternating nodes of the moons orbit


 saros 139 
it is a part of saros series 139 repeating every 18 years 11 days 8 hours containing 71 events the series started with partial solar eclipse on may 17 1501 it contains hybrid eclipses on august 11 1627 through december 9 1825 and total eclipses from december 21 1843 through march 26 2601 the series ends at member 71 as a partial eclipse on july 3 2763 members in the same column are one exeligmos apart and thus occur in the same geographic area
the solar eclipse of june 13 2132 will be the longest total solar eclipse since july 11 1991 at 6 minutes 55 seconds
the longest duration of totality will be produced by member 39 at 7 minutes 29 seconds on july 16 2186 this is the longest solar eclipse computed between 4000bc and 6000ad


 tritos series 
this eclipse is a part of a tritos cycle repeating at alternating nodes every 135 synodic months ≈ 3986.63 days or 11 years minus 1 month their appearance and longitude are irregular due to a lack of synchronization with the anomalistic month period of perigee but groupings of 3 tritos cycles ≈ 33 years minus 3 months come close ≈ 434.044 anomalistic months so eclipses are similar in these groupings


 metonic series 
the metonic series repeats eclipses every 19 years 6939.69 days lasting about 5 cycles eclipses occur in nearly the same calendar date in addition the octon subseries repeats 1/5 of that or every 3.8 years 1387.94 days
