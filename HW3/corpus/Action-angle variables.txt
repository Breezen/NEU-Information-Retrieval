in classical mechanics action-angle coordinates are a set of canonical coordinates useful in solving many integrable systems the method of action-angles is useful for obtaining the frequencies of oscillatory or rotational motion without solving the equations of motion action-angle coordinates are chiefly used when the hamilton–jacobi equations are completely separable hence the hamiltonian does not depend explicitly on time ie the energy is conserved action-angle variables define an invariant torus so called because holding the action constant defines the surface of a torus while the angle variables parameterize the coordinates on the torus
the bohr–sommerfeld quantization conditions used to develop quantum mechanics before the advent of wave mechanics state that the action must be an integral multiple of plancks constant similarly einsteins insight into ebk quantization and the difficulty of quantizing non-integrable systems was expressed in terms of the invariant tori of action-angle coordinates
action-angle coordinates are also useful in perturbation theory of hamiltonian mechanics especially in determining adiabatic invariants one of the earliest results from chaos theory for the non-linear perturbations of dynamical systems with a small number of degrees of freedom is the kam theorem which states that the invariant tori are stable under small perturbations
the use of action-angle variables was central to the solution of the toda lattice and to the definition of lax pairs or more generally the idea of the isospectral evolution of a system

 summary of basic protocol 
the general procedure has three steps
calculate the new generalized momenta 
  
    
      
        
          j
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    displaystyle jk
  
express the original hamiltonian entirely in terms of these variables
take the derivatives of the hamiltonian with respect to these momenta to obtain the frequencies 
  
    
      
        
          ν
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    displaystyle nu k
  


 degeneracy 
in some cases the frequencies of two different generalized coordinates are identical ie 
  
    
      
        
          ν
          
            k
          
        
        
        
          ν
          
            l
          
        
      
    
    displaystyle nu knu l
   for 
  
    
      
        k
        ≠
        l
      
    
    displaystyle kneq l
   in such cases the motion is called degenerate
degenerate motion signals that there are additional general conserved quantities for example the frequencies of the kepler problem are degenerate corresponding to the conservation of the laplace–runge–lenz vector
degenerate motion also signals that the hamilton–jacobi equations are completely separable in more than one coordinate system for example the kepler problem is completely separable in both spherical coordinates and parabolic coordinates
