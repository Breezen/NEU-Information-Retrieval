in solar physics a spicule is a dynamic jet of about 500 km diameter in the chromosphere of the sun it moves upwards at about 20 kms from the photosphere they were discovered in 1877 by father angelo secchi of the observatory of roman collegium in rome


 description 
spicules last for about 15 minutes at the solar limb they appear elongated if seen on the disk they are known as mottles or fibrils they are usually associated with regions of high magnetic flux their mass flux is about 100 times that of the solar wind they rise at a rate of 20 kms or 72,000 kmh and can reach several thousand kilometers in height before collapsing and fading away


 prevalence 
there are about 300,000 active spicules at any one time on the suns chromosphere amounting to about 1% of the suns surface an individual spicule typically reaches 3,000-10,000 km altitude above the photosphere


 causes 
bart de pontieu lockheed martin solar and astrophysics laboratory palo alto california united states robert erdélyi and stewart james both from the university of sheffield united kingdom hypothesised in 2004 that spicules formed as a result of p-mode oscillations in the suns surface sound waves with a period of about five minutes that causes the suns surface to rise and fall at several hundred meters per second see helioseismology magnetic flux tubes that tilted away from the vertical can focus and guide the rising material up into the solar atmosphere to form a spicule there is still however some controversy about the issue in the solar physics community
