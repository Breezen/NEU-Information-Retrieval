albert abraham michelson ffrs hfrse december 19 1852 – may 9 1931 was an american physicist known for his work on measuring the speed of light and especially for the michelson–morley experiment in 1907 he received the nobel prize in physics becoming the first american to win the nobel prize in a science


 biography 
michelson was born in strzelno province of posen in germany now poland the son of samuel michelson and his wife rozalia przyłubska both of jewish descent he moved to the us with his parents in 1855 at the age of two he grew up in the mining towns of murphys camp california and virginia city nevada where his father was a merchant his family was jewish by birth but non-religious and michelson himself was a lifelong agnostic he spent his high school years in san francisco in the home of his aunt henriette levy née michelson who was the mother of author harriet lane levy
president ulysses s grant awarded michelson a special appointment to the us naval academy in 1869 during his four years as a midshipman at the academy michelson excelled in optics heat climatology and drawing after graduating in 1873 and two years at sea he returned to the naval academy in 1875 to become an instructor in physics and chemistry until 1879 in 1879 he was posted to the nautical almanac office washington part of the united states naval observatory to work with simon newcomb in the following year he obtained leave of absence to continue his studies in europe he visited the universities of berlin and heidelberg and the collège de france and école polytechnique in paris
in 1877 he married margaret hemingway daughter of a wealthy new york stockbroker and lawyer they had two sons and a daughter
michelson was fascinated with the sciences and the problem of measuring the speed of light in particular while at annapolis he conducted his first experiments of the speed of light as part of a class demonstration in 1877 his annapolis experiment was refined and in 1879 he measured the speed of light in air to be 299,864 ± 51 kilometres per second and estimated the speed of light in vacuum as 299,940 kms or 186,380 mis after two years of studies in europe he resigned from the navy in 1881 in 1883 he accepted a position as professor of physics at the case school of applied science in cleveland ohio and concentrated on developing an improved interferometer in 1887 he and edward morley carried out the famous michelson–morley experiment which failed to detect evidence of the existence of the luminiferous ether he later moved on to use astronomical interferometers in the measurement of stellar diameters and in measuring the separations of binary stars
in 1889 michelson became a professor at clark university at worcester massachusetts and in 1892 was appointed professor and the first head of the department of physics at the newly organized university of chicago
in 1907 michelson had the honor of being the first american to receive a nobel prize in physics for his optical precision instruments and the spectroscopic and metrological investigations carried out with their aid he also won the copley medal in 1907 the henry draper medal in 1916 and the gold medal of the royal astronomical society in 1923 a crater on the moon is named after him
michelson died in pasadena california at the age of 78 the university of chicago residence halls remembered michelson and his achievements by dedicating michelson house in his honor case western reserve has dedicated a michelson house to him and michelson hall an academic building of science classrooms laboratories and offices at the united states naval academy also bears his name clark university named a theatre after him michelson laboratory at naval air weapons station china lake in ridgecrest california is named for him there is a display in the publicly accessible area of the lab which includes facsimiles of michelsons nobel prize medal the prize document and examples of his diffraction gratings
numerous awards lectures and honors have been created in albert a michelson’s name some of the current awards and lectures named for michelson include the following the bomem-michelson award and lecture annually presented until 2017 by the coblentz society the michelson-morley award and lecture along with the michelson lecture series and the michelson postdoctoral prize lectureship all of which are given annually by case western reserve university the aa michelson award presented every year by the computer measurement group the albert a michelson award given by the navy league of the united states and the michelson memorial lecture series presented annually by the division of mathematics and science at the us naval academy


 family 
in 1899 he married edna stanton they raised one son and three daughters


 speed of light 


 early measurements 
as early as 1869 while still serving as an officer in the united states navy michelson started planning a repeat of the rotating-mirror method of léon foucault for measuring the speed of light using improved optics and a longer baseline he conducted some preliminary measurements using largely improvised equipment in 1878 about the same time that his work came to the attention of simon newcomb director of the nautical almanac office who was already advanced in planning his own study michelson published his result of 299,910 ± 50 kms in 1879 before joining newcomb in washington dc to assist with his measurements there thus began a long professional collaboration and friendship between the two
simon newcomb with his more adequately funded project obtained a value of 299,860 ± 30 kms just at the extreme edge of consistency with michelsons michelson continued to refine his method and in 1883 published a measurement of 299,853 ± 60 kms rather closer to that of his mentor


 mount wilson and lookout mountain 
in 1906 a novel electrical method was used by e b rosa and the national bureau of standards to obtain a value for the speed of light of 299,781 ± 10 kms though this result has subsequently been shown to be severely biased by the poor electrical standards in use at the time it seems to have set a fashion for rather lower measured values
from 1920 michelson started planning a definitive measurement from the mount wilson observatory using a baseline to lookout mountain a prominent bump on the south ridge of mount san antonio old baldy some 22 miles distant
in 1922 the us coast and geodetic survey began two years of painstaking measurement of the baseline using the recently available invar tapes with the baseline length established in 1924 measurements were carried out over the next two years to obtain the published value of 299,796 ± 4 kms
famous as the measurement is it was beset by problems not least of which was the haze created by the smoke from forest fires which blurred the mirror image it is also probable that the intensively detailed work of the geodetic survey with an estimated error of less than one part in 1 million was compromised by a shift in the baseline arising from the santa barbara earthquake of june 29 1925 which was an estimated magnitude of 6.3 on the richter scale
the now-famous michelson–morley experiment also influenced the affirmation attempts of peer albert einsteins theory of general relativity and special relativity using similar optical instrumentation these instruments and related collaborations included the participation of fellow physicists dayton miller hendrik lorentz and robert shankland


 michelson pease and pearson 
the period after 1927 marked the advent of new measurements of the speed of light using novel electro-optic devices all substantially lower than michelsons 1926 value
michelson sought another measurement but this time in an evacuated tube to avoid difficulties in interpreting the image owing to atmospheric effects in 1929 he began a collaboration with francis g pease and fred pearson to perform a measurement in a 1.6 km tube 3 feet in diameter at the irvine ranch near santa ana california in multiple reflections the light path was increased to 5 miles for the first time in history the speed of light was measured in an almost perfect vacuum of 0.5 mm of mercury michelson died with only 36 of the 233 measurement series completed and the experiment was subsequently beset by geological instability and condensation problems before the result of 299,774 ± 11 kms consistent with the prevailing electro-optic values was published posthumously in 1935


 michelson-morley interferometry experiment 

in 1887 he collaborated with colleague edward williams morley of western reserve university now part of case western reserve university in the michelson–morley experiment their experiment for the expected motion of the earth relative to the aether the hypothetical medium in which light was supposed to travel resulted in a null result surprised michelson repeated the experiment with greater and greater precision over the next years but continued to find no ability to measure the aether the michelson-morley results were immensely influential in the physics community leading hendrik lorentz to devise his now-famous lorentz contraction equations as a means of explaining the null result
there has been some historical controversy over whether albert einstein was aware of the michelson–morley results when he developed his theory of special relativity which pronounced the aether to be superfluous in a later interview einstein said of the michelson–morley experiment i was not conscious it had influenced me directly i guess i just took it for granted that it was true regardless of einsteins specific knowledge the experiment is today considered the canonical experiment in regards to showing the lack of a detectable aether
the precision of their equipment allowed michelson and morley to be the first to get precise values for the fine structure in the atomic spectral lines for which in 1916 arnold sommerfeld gave a theoretical explanation introducing the fine-structure constant


 astronomical interferometry 
from 1920 and into 1921 michelson and francis g pease became the first individuals to measure the diameter of a star other than the sun they used an astronomical interferometer at the mount wilson observatory to measure the diameter of the super-giant star betelgeuse a periscope arrangement was used to obtain a densified pupil in the interferometer a method later investigated in detail by antoine émile henry labeyrie for use in hypertelescopes the measurement of stellar diameters and the separations of binary stars took up an increasing amount of michelsons life after this
a century later the specific interferometer instrumentation design produced by albert michelson has become the principal means to conduct astronomical interferometry the michelson interferometer design is found on modern operational observatories such as vlti chara and the us navys npoi


 michelson in popular culture 

in an episode of the television series bonanza look to the stars broadcast march 18 1962 ben cartwright lorne greene helps the 16-year-old michelson portrayed by 25-year-old douglas lambert 1936–1986 obtain an appointment to the us naval academy despite the opposition of the bigoted town schoolteacher played by william schallert bonanza was set in and around virginia city nevada where michelson lived with his parents prior to leaving for the naval academy in a voice-over at the end of the episode greene mentions michelsons 1907 nobel prize
the home in which michelson lived as a child in murphys camp california is now a tasting room for hovey wine
new beast theater works in collaboration with high concept laboratories produced a semi-opera about michelson his obsessive working style and its effect on his family life the production ran from february 11 to february 26 2011 in chicago at the building stage michelson was portrayed by jon stutzman the play was directed by david maral with music composed by joshua dumas
norman fitzroy maclean wrote an essay billiards is a good game published in the norman maclean reader ed o alan weltzien 2008 it is an appreciation of michelson from macleans vantage point as a graduate student regularly watching him play billiards
