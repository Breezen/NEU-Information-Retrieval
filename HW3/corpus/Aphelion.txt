the perihelion  of any orbit of a celestial body about the sun is the point where the body comes nearest to the sun it is the opposite of aphelion  which is the point in the orbit where the celestial body is farthest from the sun


 etymology 
the words perihelion and aphelion were coined by johannes kepler to describe the orbital motion of the planets the words are formed from the prefixes peri- greek περί near and apo- greek ἀπό away from affixed to the greek word for the sun ἥλιοσ
perihelion and aphelion are sometimes incorrectly used for the orbits of objects about bodies other than the sun the correct terms are
for orbits around the earth perigee and apogee
for orbits around a star periastron and apastron
for orbits around any center of mass periapsis or pericenter and apoapsis or apocenter


 astronomical meaning 
according to keplers first law of planetary motion all planets comets and asteroids in the solar system have approximately elliptical orbits around the sun it is only approximate because of perturbations due to the gravity of other bodies every ellipse has two focus points and the sun is at one of these focus points for the elliptical orbits of its satellites hence an orbiting body has a closest and a farthest point from its parent object that is a perihelion and an aphelion each extreme is known as an apsis
orbital eccentricity measures the flatness departure from a perfect circle of the orbit


 application to earth 

earth is about 147.1 million kilometers 91.4 million miles from the sun at perihelion around january 3 in contrast to about 152.1 million kilometers 94.5 million miles at aphelion around july 4 — a difference of about 5.0 million kilometers 3.1 million miles these dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors which follow cyclical patterns known as milankovitch cycles for a table of these dates for various years see apsis
because of the increased distance at aphelion only 93.55% of the solar radiation from the sun falls on a given area of land as does at perihelion however this fluctuation does not account for the seasons as it is summer in the northern hemisphere when it is winter in the southern hemisphere and vice versa instead seasons result from the tilt of earths axis which is 23.4 degrees away from perpendicular to the plane of earths orbit around the sun winter falls on the hemisphere where sunlight strikes least directly and summer falls where sunlight strikes most directly regardless of the earths distance from the sun
in the northern hemisphere summer occurs at the same time as aphelion despite this there are larger land masses in the northern hemisphere which are easier to heat than the seas consequently summers are 2.3 °c 4 °f warmer in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere under similar conditions
