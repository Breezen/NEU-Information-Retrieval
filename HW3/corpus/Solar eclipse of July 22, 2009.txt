the eclipse and the reaction of thousands of observers at varanasi was captured by the science channel wonders of the universe series hosted by brian cox
this eclipse may be the most-viewed total solar eclipse in history with 30 million people in shanghai and hangzhou alone


 observations 

thousands of pilgrims gathered on the banks of the ganges river in varanasi india to experience the eclipse as a religious or spiritual event some people expected that there would be a relationship either positive or negative between their health and the occurrence of the eclipse

indian scientists observed the solar eclipse from an indian air force plane
the chinese government used the opportunity to provide scientific education and to dispel any superstition a flight by china eastern airlines from wuhan to shanghai took a slight detour and followed the course of the eclipse to allow longer observation time for the scientists on board
observers in japan were excited by the prospect of experiencing the first eclipse in 46 years but found the experience dampened by cloudy skies obscuring the view
in bangladesh where the eclipse lasted approximately 3 minutes and 44 seconds thousands of people were able to witness the eclipse despite rain and overcast skies


 duration 

this solar eclipse was the longest total solar eclipse to occur in the 21st century and will not be surpassed in duration until 13 june 2132 totality lasted for up to 6 minutes and 39 seconds with the maximum eclipse occurring in the ocean at 023521 utc about 100 km south of the bonin islands southeast of japan the uninhabited north iwo jima island was the landmass with totality time closest to maximum while the closest inhabited point was akusekijima where the eclipse lasted 6 minutes and 26 seconds
the cruise ship costa classica was chartered specifically to view this eclipse and by viewing the eclipse at the point of maximum duration and cruising along the centerline during the event duration was extended to 6 minutes 42 seconds
the eclipse was part of saros series 136 as was the solar eclipse of july 11 1991 which was slightly longer lasting up to 6 minutes 53 seconds previous eclipses of the same saros series on june 30 1973 and june 20 1955 were longer lasting 7 min 04 and 7 min 08 respectively the next event from this series will be on august 2 2027 the exceptional duration was a result of the moon being near perigee with the apparent diameter of the moon 8% larger than the sun magnitude 1.080 and the earth being near aphelion where the sun appeared slightly smaller
in contrast the annular solar eclipse of january 26 2009 occurred near lunar apogee and 7% smaller apparent diameter to the sun and the next solar eclipse of january 15 2010 was also annular with the moon 8.1% smaller than the sun
