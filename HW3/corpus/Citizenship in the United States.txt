military participation is not currently required in the united states but a policy of conscription of men has been in place at various times both in war and in peace in american history most recently during the vietnam war currently the united states armed forces are a professional all-volunteer force although both male us citizens and male non-citizen permanent residents are required to register with the selective service system and may be called up in the event of a future draft johns hopkins university political scientist benjamin ginsberg writes the professional military has limited the need for citizen soldiers

 civic participation 
civic participation is not required in the united states there is no requirement to attend town meetings belong to a political party or vote in elections however a benefit of naturalization is the ability to participate fully in the civic life of the country there is disagreement about whether popular lack of involvement in politics is helpful or harmful
vanderbilt professor dana d nelson suggests that most americans merely vote for president every four years and sees this pattern as undemocratic in her book bad for democracy nelson argues that declining citizen participation in politics is unhealthy for long term prospects for democracy
however writers such as robert d kaplan in the atlantic see benefits to non-involvement he wrote the very indifference of most people allows for a calm and healthy political climate kaplan elaborated apathy after all often means that the political situation is healthy enough to be ignored the last thing america needs is more voters—particularly badly educated and alienated ones—with a passion for politics he argued that civic participation in itself is not always a sufficient condition to bring good outcomes and pointed to authoritarian societies such as singapore which prospered because it had relative safety from corruption from breach of contract from property expropriation and from bureaucratic inefficiency


 dual citizenship 

a person who is considered a citizen by more than one nation has dual citizenship it is possible for a united states citizen to have dual citizenship this can be achieved in various ways such as by birth in the united states to a parent who is a citizen of a foreign country or in certain circumstances the foreign nationality may be transmitted even by a grandparent by birth in another country to a parents who isare a united states citizens or by having parents who are citizens of different countries anyone who becomes a naturalized us citizen is required to renounce any prior allegiance to other countries during the naturalization ceremony however this renunciation of allegiance is generally not considered renunciation of citizenship to those countries
the earliest recorded instances of dual citizenship began before the french revolution when the british captured american ships and forced them back to europe the british crown considered subjects from the united states as british by birth and forced them to fight in the napoleonic wars
under certain circumstances there are relevant distinctions between dual citizens who hold a substantial contact with a country for example by holding a passport or by residing in the country for a certain period of time and those who do not for example under the heroes earnings assistance and relief tax heart act of 2008 us citizens in general are subject to an expatriation tax if they give up us citizenship but there are exceptions specifically 26 usc § 877ag1b for those who are either under age 18½ upon giving up us citizenship and have lived in the us for less than ten years in their lives or who are dual citizens by birth residing in their other country of citizenship at the time of giving up us citizenship and have lived in the us for less than ten out of the past fifteen years similarly the united states considers holders of a foreign passport to have a substantial contact with the country that issued the passport which may preclude security clearance
us citizens are required by federal law to identify themselves with a us passport not with any other foreign passport when entering or leaving the united states the supreme court case of afroyim v rusk declared that a us citizen did not lose his citizenship by voting in an election in a foreign country or by acquiring foreign citizenship if they did not intend to lose us citizenship us citizens who have dual citizenship do not lose their united states citizenship unless they renounce it officially


 history of citizenship in the united states 

citizenship began in colonial times as an active relation between men working cooperatively to solve municipal problems and participating actively in democratic decision-making such as in new england town hall meetings men met regularly to discuss local affairs and make decisions these town meetings were described as the earliest form of american democracy which was vital since citizen participation in public affairs helped keep democracy sturdy according to alexis de tocqueville in 1835 a variety of forces changed this relation during the nations history citizenship became less defined by participation in politics and more defined as a legal relation with accompanying rights and privileges while the realm of civic participation in the public sphere has shrunk the citizenship franchise has been expanded to include not just propertied white adult men but black men and adult women
earlier on us citizenship was not given to people of indian or east asian descent a k mozumdar was the first person born in the indian sub-continent to attain us citizenship few years earlier as a result of the 1898 united states v wong kim ark supreme court decision ethnic chinese born in the united states became citizens during world war ii due to japans heavy involvement as an aggressor it was decided to restrict many japanese citizens from applying for us citizenship while chinese citizens encountered no trouble because of chinas alliance with the united states
the equal nationality act of 1934 was an american law which allowed foreign-born children of american mothers and alien fathers who had entered america before age 18 and lived in america for five years to apply for american citizenship for the first time it also made the naturalization process quicker for american womens alien husbands this law equalized expatriation immigration naturalization and repatriation between women and men however it was not applied retroactively and was modified by later laws such as the nationality act of 1940


 birthright citizenship 

us citizenship is usually acquired by birth when a child is born in the territory of the united states in addition to us states this includes the district of columbia guam puerto rico the northern mariana islands and the us virgin islands citizenship however was not specified in the original constitution in 1868 the fourteenth amendment specifically defined persons who were either born or naturalized in the united states and subject to its jurisdiction as citizens all babies born in the united states—except those born to enemy aliens in wartime or the children of foreign diplomats—enjoy us citizenship under the supreme courts long-standing interpretation of the fourteenth amendment the amendment states all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside there remains dispute as to who is subject to the jurisdiction of the united states at birth
by acts of congress every person born in puerto rico the us virgin islands guam and the northern mariana islands is a united states citizen by birth also every person born in the former panama canal zone whose father or mother or both are or were a citizen is a united states citizen by birth
regardless of where they are born children of us citizens are us citizens in most cases children born outside the united states with at least one us citizen parent usually have birthright citizenship by parentage
a child of unknown parentage found in the us while under the age of 5 is considered a us citizen until provenbefore reaching the age of 22 to have not been born in the us
while persons born in the united states are considered to be citizens and can have passports children under age eighteen are legally considered to be minors and cannot vote or hold office upon the event of their eighteenth birthday they are considered full citizens but there is no ceremony acknowledging this relation or any correspondence between the new citizen and the government to this effect citizenship is assumed to exist and the relation is assumed to remain viable until death or until it is renounced or dissolved by some other legal process secondary schools teach the basics of citizenship and create informed and responsible citizens who are skilled in the arts of effective deliberation and action
americans who live in foreign countries and become members of other governments have in some instances been stripped of citizenship although there have been court cases where decisions regarding citizenship have been reversed


 naturalized citizenship 
acts of congress provide for acquisition of citizenship by persons born abroad


 agency in charge 

the agency in charge of admitting new citizens is the united states citizenship and immigration services commonly abbreviated as uscis it is a bureau of the department of homeland security it offers web-based services the agency depends on application fees for revenue in 2009 with a struggling economy applications were down sharply and consequently there was much less revenue to upgrade and streamline services there was speculation that if the administration of president barack obama passed immigration reform measures then the agency could face a welcome but overwhelming surge of americans-in-waiting and longer processing times for citizenship applications the uscis has made efforts to digitize records a uscis website says the us citizenship and immigration services uscis is committed to offering the best possible service to you our customer and which says with our focus on customer service we offer you a variety of services both before and after you file your case the website allowed applicants to estimate the length of time required to process specific types of cases to check application status and to access a customer guide the uscis processes cases in the order theyre received


 pathways to citizenship 

people applying to become citizens must satisfy certain requirements for example there have been requirements that applicants have been permanent residents for five years three if married to a us citizen be of good moral character meaning no felony convictions be of sound mind in the judgment of immigration officials have knowledge of the constitution and be able to speak and understand english unless they are elderly or disabled applicants must also pass a simple citizenship test up until recently a test published by the immigration and naturalization service asked questions such as how many stars are there in our flag and what is the constitution and who is the president of the united states today at one point the government printing office sold flashcards for 8.50 to help test takers prepare for the test in 2006 the government replaced the former trivia test with a ten-question oral test designed to shun simple historical facts about america that can be recounted in a few words for more explanation about the principles of american democracy such as freedom one reviewer described the new citizenship test as thoughtful while some have criticized the new version of the test officials counter that the new test is a teachable moment without making it conceptually more difficult since the list of possible questions and answers as before will be publicly available six correct answers constitutes a passing grade the new test probes for signs that immigrants understand and share american values a unique way to become a permanent resident is to apply to the us government dv lottery this program is a drawing for foreigners to apply for a drawing to become a permanent resident
military participation is often a way for immigrant residents to become citizens since many people seek citizenship for its financial and social benefits the promise of citizenship can be seen as a means of motivating persons to do dangerous activities such as fight in wars for example a 2009 article in the new york times said that the united states military was recruiting skilled immigrants who are living in this country with temporary visas by promising an opportunity to become citizens in as little as six months in exchange for service in afghanistan and iraq where us forces are stretched thin the option was not open to illegal immigrants one estimate was that in 2009 the us military had 29,000 foreign-born people currently serving who were not american citizens spouses of citizens or non-citizens who served in the military also have less difficulty becoming citizens one analyst noted that many immigrants not yet citizens have volunteered to serve in the united states military forces  some have been killed and others wounded  perhaps this can be seen as a cynical attempt to qualify more easily for us citizenship  but i think that service in the us military has to be taken as a pretty serious commitment to the united states immigrant soldiers who fight for the us often have an easier and faster path to citizenship in 2002 president bush signed an executive order to eliminate the three-year waiting period and made service personnel immediately eligible for citizenship in 2003 congress voted to cut the waiting period to become a citizen from three years down to one year for immigrants who had served in the armed forces in 2003 of 1.4 million service members 37,000 active-duty members were not citizens and of these 20 percent had applied for citizenship by june 2003 12 non-citizens had died fighting for the united states in the iraqi war the military has had a tradition of filling out its ranks with aliens living in the us non-citizens fought in world war ii the military has struggled to fill its depleted ranks by recruiting more non-us citizens but there is considerable anxiety about using foreigners to serve in the us armed forces general dwight d eisenhower was quoted as saying when rome went out and hired mercenary soldiers rome fell
grandparent rule section 322 of the ina added in 1994 enabled children of a us citizen who did not get citizenship at birth to use the physical presence period in the us of a grandparent who was a citizen to qualify for us citizenship in 2006 there were 4,000 applications of citizenship using the physical presence of grandparents israelis comprise 90% of those taking advantage of the clause


 strong demand 
according to a senior fellow at the migration policy institute citizenship is a very very valuable commodity however one study suggested legal residents eligible for citizenship but who dont apply tend to have low incomes 41 percent do not speak english well 60 percent or have low levels of education 25 percent there is strong demand for citizenship based on the number of applications filed from 1920 to 1940 the number of immigrants to the united states who became citizens numbered about 200,000 each year there was a spike after world war ii and then the level reduced to about 150,000 per year until resuming to the 200,000 level beginning about 1980 in the mid-1990s to 2009 the levels rose to about 500,000 per year with considerable variation in 1996 more than one million people became citizens through naturalization in 1997 there were 1.41 million applications filed in 2006 1.38 million the number of naturalized citizens in the united states rose from 6.5 million in the mid-1990s to 11 million in 2002 by 2003 the pool of immigrants eligible to become naturalized citizens was 8 million and of these 2.7 million lived in california in 2003 the number of new citizens from naturalization was 463,204 in 2007 the number was 702,589 in 2007 1.38 million people applied for citizenship creating a backlog in 2008 applications decreased to 525,786
naturalization fees were 60 in 1989 90 in 1991 95 in 1994 225 in 1999 260 in 2002 320 in 2003 330 in 2005 in 2007 application fees were increased from 330 to 595 and an additional 80 computerized fingerprinting fee was added the biometrics fee was increased to 85 in 2010 on december 23 2016 the application fees were increased again from 595 to 640 the high fees have been criticized as putting up one more wall to citizenship increases in fees for citizenship have drawn criticism doris meissner a senior fellow at the migration policy institute and former immigration and naturalization service commissioner doubted that fee increases deter citizenship-seekers in 2009 the number of immigrants applying for citizenship plunged 62 percent reasons cited were the slowing economy and the cost of naturalization


 citizenship ceremonies 

the citizenship process has been described as a ritual that is meaningful for many immigrants many new citizens are sworn in during fourth of july ceremonies most citizenship ceremonies take place at offices of the us citizenship and immigration services however one swearing-in ceremony was held at arlington national cemetery in virginia in 2008 the judge who chose this venue explained i did it to honor our countrys warriors and to give the new citizens a sense for what makes this country great according to federal law citizenship applicants who are also changing their names must appear before a federal judge


 honorary citizenship 

the title of honorary citizen of the united states has been granted eight times by an act of congress or by a proclamation issued by the president pursuant to authorization granted by congress the eight individuals are sir winston churchill raoul wallenberg william penn hannah callowhill penn mother teresa the marquis de lafayette casimir pulaski and bernardo de gálvez y madrid viscount of galveston and count of gálvez
sometimes the government awarded non-citizen immigrants who died fighting for american forces with the posthumous title of us citizen but this is not considered honorary citizenship in june 2003 congress approved legislation to help families of fallen non-citizen soldiers


 corporate citizenship 
there is a sense in which corporations can be considered citizens since corporations are considered persons in the eyes of the law it is possible to think of corporations as being like citizens for example the airline virgin america asked the united states department of transportation to be treated as an american air carrier the advantage of citizenship is having the protection and support of the united states government when jockeying with foreign governments for access to air routes and overseas airports alaska airlines a competitor of virgin america asked for a review of the situation according to us law foreign ownership in a us air carrier is limited to 25% of the voting interest in the carrier but executives at virgin america insisted the airline met this requirement
for the purposes of diversity jurisdiction in the united states civil procedure corporate citizenship is determined by the principal place of business of the corporation there is some degree of disagreement among legal authorities as to how exactly this may be determined
another sense of corporate citizenship is a way to show support for causes such as social issues and the environment and indirectly gain a kind of reputational advantage


 citizenship vs nationality 
a distinction is made between us citizenship and us nationality under us law citizenship in the united states comprises a larger set of privileges and rights for those persons that are us citizens which is not afforded to individuals that are only us nationals by virtue of their rights under us nationality law united states law makes a precise distinction between a united states citizen and a united states national although all us citizens are also us nationals not all us nationals are us citizens the united states naturalization act of 1790 1 stat 103 provided the first rules to be followed by the united states in the granting of national citizenship after the ratification of the us constitution a number of other acts and statutes followed the act of 1790 that expanded or addressed specific situations but it was not until the immigration and nationality act of 1952 publ 82–414 66 stat 163 enacted june 27 1952 codified under title 8 of the united states code 8 usc ch 12 that the variety of statutes governing citizenship law were organized within one single body of text the immigration and nationality act of 1952 set forth the legal requirements for the acquisition of american nationality the fourteenth amendment 1868 addressed citizenship rights the united states nationality law 8 usc § 1408 despite its nationality title comprises the statues that embody the law regarding both american citizenship and american nationality
for example as specified in 8 usc § 1408 a person whose only connection to the us is through birth in an outlying possession which as of march 2015 was defined in 8 usc § 1101 as american samoa and swains island or through descent from a person so born acquires only us nationality not us citizenship such person is said to be a us national not a us citizen or simply a us noncitizen national
as of february 11 2014 american samoans continued to be us nationals but not us citizens ie us noncitizen nationals people born in american samoa receive passports declaring the holder is only a us national not a us citizen for an america samoan to become a us citizen he or she must relocate to another part of the united states initiate the naturalization process pay the 680 fee as of february 11 2014 pass a moral character assessment be fingerprinted and pass an englishcivics examination
in addition residents of the northern mariana islands who automatically gained us citizenship in 1986 as a result of the covenant between the northern mariana islands and the us could elect to become us noncitizen nationals within 6 months of the implementation of the covenant or within 6 months of turning 18
the nationality status of a person born in an unincorporated us minor outlying island is not specifically mentioned by law but under international law and supreme court dicta they are also regarded as us noncitizen nationals
u s noncitizen nationals may reside and work in the united states without restrictions and may apply for citizenship under the same rules as resident aliens like resident aliens they are not presently allowed by any us state to vote in federal or state elections although as with resident aliens there is no constitutional prohibition against their doing so like us citizens us noncitizen nationals may transmit their us noncitizen nationality to children born abroad although the rules are somewhat different from those for us citizens
the us passport issued to noncitizen nationals contains the endorsement code 9 which states the bearer is a united states national and not a united states citizen on the annotations page


 controversies 
the issue of citizenship naturalization is a highly contentious matter in us politics particularly regarding illegal immigrants candidates in the 2008 presidential election such as rudolph giuliani tried to carve out a middle ground on the issue of illegal immigration but rivals such as john mccain advocated legislation requiring illegal immigrants to first leave the country before being eligible to apply as citizens some measures to require proof of citizenship upon registering to vote have met with controversy
issues such as whether to include questions about current citizenship status in census questions have been debated in the senate generally there tends to be controversy when citizenship affects political issues for example issues such as asking questions about citizenship on the united states census tend to cause controversy census data affects state electoral clout it also affects budgetary allocations including non-citizens in census counts also shifts political power to states that have large numbers of non-citizens due to the fact that reapportionment of congressional seats is based on census data
there have been controversies based on speculation about which way newly naturalized citizens are likely to vote since immigrants from many countries have been presumed to vote democratic if naturalized there have been efforts by democratic administrations to streamline citizenship applications before elections to increase turnout republicans in contrast have exerted pressure to slow down the process in 1997 there were efforts to strip the citizenship of 5,000 newly approved immigrants who it was thought had been wrongly naturalized a legal effort to do this presented enormous challenges an examination by the immigration and naturalization service of 1.1 million people who were granted citizenship from september 1995 to september 1996 found 4,946 cases in which a criminal arrest should have disqualified an applicant or in which an applicant lied about his or her criminal history before the 2008 election there was controversy about the speed of the uscis in processing applications one report suggested that the agency would complete 930,000 applications in time for the newly processed citizens to vote in the november 2008 election foreign-born naturalized citizens tend to vote at the same rates as natives for example in the state of new jersey in the 2008 election the foreign born represented 20.1 percent of the states population of 8,754,560 of these 636,000 were eighteen or older and hence eligible to vote of eligible voters 396,000 actually voted which was about 62 so foreign-born citizens vote in roughly the same proportion 62 as native citizens 67
there has been controversy about the agency in charge of citizenship the uscis has been criticized as being a notoriously surly inattentive bureaucracy with long backlogs in which would-be citizens spent years waiting for paperwork rules made by united states congress and the federal government regarding citizenship are highly technical and often confusing and the agency is forced to cope with enforcement within a complex regulatory milieu there have been instances in which applicants for citizenship have been deported on technicalities one pennsylvania doctor and his wife both from the philippines who applied for citizenship and one mr darnell from canada who was married to an american with two children from this marriage ran afoul of legal technicalities and faced deportation the new york times reported that mr darnell discovered that a 10-year-old conviction for domestic violence involving a former girlfriend even though it had been reduced to a misdemeanor and erased from his public record made him ineligible to become a citizen—or even to continue living in the united states overworked federal examiners under pressure to make quick decisions as well as weed out security risks have been described as preferring to err on the side of rejection in 2000 399,670 applications were denied about 1/3 of all applications in 2007 89,683 applications for naturalization were denied about 12 percent of those presented
generally eligibility for citizenship is denied for the millions of people living in the united states illegally although from time to time there have been amnesties in 2006 there were mass protests numbering hundreds of thousands of people throughout the us demanding us citizenship for illegal immigrants many carried banners which read we have a dream too one estimate is that there are 12 million illegal immigrants in the usa in 2006 there are many american high school students with citizenship issues in 2008 it was estimated that there were 65,000 illegal immigrant students the number was less clear for post-secondary education a 1982 supreme court decision entitled illegal immigrants to free education from kindergarten through high school undocumented immigrants who get arrested face difficulties in the courtroom as they have no constitutional right to challenge the outcome of their deportation hearings in 2009 writer tom barry of the boston review criticized the crackdown against illegal immigrants since it flooded the federal courts with nonviolent offenders besieged poor communities and dramatically increased the us prison population while doing little to solve the problem itself barry criticized the united states high incarceration rate as being fives times greater than the average rate in the rest of the world virginia senator jim webb agreed that we are doing something dramatically wrong in our criminal justice system


 renunciation of citizenship 

united states citizens can renounce citizenship the process of renunciation requires the citizen to appear at a united states embassy or consulate and sign various documents stating he or she is of good mental health is acting without force or duress and realizes that the renunciation is irrevocable a renunciation of other citizenships may be a requirement in some countries before the grant of their citizenship it is a common misunderstanding that one must first be a citizen of another country in order to be eligible for the renunciation of his or her us citizenship however persons choosing to renounce us citizenship who lack citizenship elsewhere and who will therefore become a stateless person are warned of the consequences of such a decision in such cases the state department will review the application and after going over the documentation may decide to bar the person from entering the united states even for visits
a factor in such determinations by the state department is whether the renunciation is being done for tax purposes ie to avoid united states taxation according to the internal revenue service the effective date of the renunciation is the final day that income taxes are due – assuming that all us assets have been liquidated and have left us jurisdiction
