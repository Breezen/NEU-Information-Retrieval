several features cover the surface of the moon these are listed below


 valleys 
among many lunar features are several large valleys that have been given names most of these valleys are named after a nearby crater see the list of craters on the moon for more information


 water features 

this is a list of maria singular mare on the moon lunar maria are the large dark regions of the moon they do not actually contain any water however they are believed to have been formed from molten rock from the moons mantle coming out onto the surface of the moon it also includes the one oceanus and the features known by the names lacus palus and sinus the modern system of lunar nomenclature was introduced in 1651 by riccioli ricciolis map of the moon was drawn by francesco maria grimaldi who has a crater named after him


 maria and oceanus 
there was also a region on the lunar farside that was briefly misidentified as a mare and named mare desiderii sea of dreams it is no longer recognized other former maria include
mare parvum small sea immediately to the east of inghirami
mare incognitum unknown sea
mare novum new sea northeast of plutarch
mare struve struves sea near messala


 lacus 
a related set of features are the lunar lacus singular lacus latin for lake which are smaller basaltic plains of similar origin


 sinus and paludes 
a related set of features are the sinus singular sinus latin for bay and paludes singular palus latin for marsh
some sources also list a palus nebularum marsh of mists at 38.0° n 1.0° e however the designation for this feature has not been officially recognized by the iau


 mountains 
these are isolated mountains or massifs
note that the heights listed below are not consistent across sources in the 1960s the us army mapping service used elevation relative to 1,737,988 meters from the center of the moon in the 1970s the us defense mapping agency used 1,730,000 meters the clementine topographic data published in the 1990s uses 1,737,400 meters
also note that this table is not comprehensive and does not list the highest places on the moon clementine data show a range of about 18,100 meters from lowest to highest point on the moon the highest point located on the far side of the moon is approximately 6500 meters higher than mons huygens usually listed as the tallest mountain


 mountain ranges 


 other features 
the moons surface is covered in many interesting geological features in addition to mountains valleys and craters the following surface features have received names in the lunar nomenclature many of these features are named after a nearby crater or mountain
the listed diameter for these features is the longest dimension that contains the entire geological formation the latitude and longitude are in selenographic coordinates


 albedo 
these features are notable for their high albedo compared to the surrounding terrain
note on the far side of the moon there are unnamed albedo features on mare ingenii and mare marginis these are located antipodal to the mare imbrium and mare orientale impact basins


 catena 
a catena is a chain of craters


 dorsa 
these features are wrinkle-ridge systems commonly found on lunar maria


 dorsum 
these features are wrinkle ridges commonly found on lunar mare


 promontorium 
these features form a cape or headland on a mare


 rima 
these features are lunar rilles


 rimae 
these features are lunar rille systems


 rupis 
these are escarpments in the surface


 terra 
the continental areas between the seas were given comparable names by giovanni battista riccioli but were opposite the names used for the seas thus there were the lands of sterility terra sterilitatis heat terra caloris and liveliness terra vitae however these names for the highland regions are no longer used on recent maps and terrae are not officially recognized as standard lunar nomenclature by the international astronomical union


 craters 
the large majority of these features are impact craters the crater nomenclature is governed by the international astronomical union and this listing only includes features that are officially recognized by that scientific society
the lunar craters are listed in the following subsections where a formation has associated satellite craters these are detailed on the main crater description pages
