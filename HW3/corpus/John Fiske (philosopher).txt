 biography 
john fiske was born edmund fiske green at hartford connecticut march 30 1842 he was the only child of edmund brewster green of smyrna delaware and mary fiske bound of middletown connecticut his father was editor of newspapers in hartford new york city and panama where he died in 1852 and his widow married edwin w stoughton of new york in 1855 on the second marriage of his mother edmund fiske green assumed the name of his maternal great-grandfather john fiske
as a child fiske exhibited remarkable precocity he lived at middletown during childhood until he entered harvard he graduated from harvard college in 1863 and from harvard law school in 1865 he had already admitted to the suffolk bar in 1864 but never practised law his career as author began in 1861 with an article on “mr buckles fallacies” published in the national quarterly review after that he was a frequent contributor to american and british periodicals
from 1869 to 1871 he was university lecturer on philosophy at harvard in 1870 instructor in history there and assistant librarian 1872-1879 on resigning the latter position in 1879 he was elected a member of the board of overseers and at the expiration of the six-years term was re-elected in 1885 beginning in 1881 he lectured annually on american history at washington university st louis missouri and beginning in 1884 held a professorship of american history at that institution but continued to make his home in cambridge massachusetts he lectured on american history at university college london in 1879 and at the royal institution of great britain in 1880 he gave many hundreds of lectures chiefly upon american history in the principal cities of the united states and great britain fiske was elected a member of the american antiquarian society in 1884
the largest part of his life was devoted to the study of history but at an early age inquiries into the nature of human progress led him to a careful study of the doctrine of evolution and it was through the popularization of charles darwins work that he first became known to the public he applied himself to the philosophical interpretation of darwins work and produced many books and essays on this subject his philosophy was influenced by herbert spencers views on evolution in a letter from charles darwin to john fiske dated from 1874 the naturalist remarks i never in my life read so lucid an expositor and therefore thinker as you are

nineteenth-century enthusiasm for brain size as a simple measure of human performance championed by scientists including darwins cousin francis galton and the french neurologist paul broca led fiske to believe in the racial superiority of the anglo-saxon race fiskes beliefs on race did not preclude his commitment to abolitionist causes indeed so anti-slavery was he that twenty-three years after the cessation of the american civil war he declared the norths victory complete despite the feeble wails of unteachable bigots in his book the destiny of man 1884 he devotes a whole chapter to the end of the working of natural selection upon man describing it as a fact of unparalleled grandeur in his view the action of natural selection upon man has  been essentially diminished through the operation of social conditions
in books such as outlines of cosmic philosophy isbn 0-384-15780-7 fiske aimed to show that in reality there has never been any conflict between religion and science nor is any reconciliation called for where harmony has always existed on page 364 he demonstrates his sensitivity to christianity as a religion
we arrive at a deeper reason than has hitherto been disclosed for the difference between our position with reference to christianity and that which has been assumed by radicalism and by positivism it is not merely that we refuse to attack christianity because we recognize its necessary adaptation to a certain stage of culture not yet passed by the average minds of the community  it is that we still regard christianity as in the deepest sense our own religion
fiske was a popular lecturer on these topics in his early career later he turned to historical writings publishing books such as the discovery of america 1892 in addition he edited with james grant wilson appletons cyclopædia of american biography 1887 he died worn out by overwork at gloucester massachusetts july 4 1901

in a brief but scathing critique of this book in his preface to the new nation 1962 the historian merrill jensen called fiskes work a book of vast influence but of no value as either history or example a few sentences farther in jensens preface he stated andrew c mclaughlin an impeccably conservative historian of the constitution who wrote a far better book on the same period said that fiskes book was altogether without scientific standing because it is little more than a remarkably skillful adaptation of a very few secondary authorities showing almost no evidence of first hand acquaintance with the sources
