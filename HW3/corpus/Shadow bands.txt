shadow bands are thin wavy lines of alternating light and dark that can be seen moving and undulating in parallel on plain-coloured surfaces immediately before and after a total solar eclipse they are caused by the refraction by earths atmospheric turbulence of the solar crescent as it thins to a narrow slit which increasingly collimates the light reaching earth in the minute just before and after totality
the shadows detailed structure is due to random patterns of fine air turbulence that refract the collimated sunlight arriving from the narrow eclipse crescent
the bands rapid sliding motion is due to shifting air currents combined with the angular motion of the sun projecting through higher altitudes the degree of collimation in the light gradually increases as the crescent thins until the solar disk is completely covered and the eclipse is total
stars twinkle for the same reason they are so far from earth that they appear as point sources of light easily disturbed by earths atmospheric turbulence which acts like lenses and prisms diverting the lights path viewed toward the collimated light of a star the shadows bands from atmospheric refraction pass over the eye


 history 
in the 9th century ce shadow bands during a total solar eclipse were described for the first time – in the völuspá part of the old icelandic poetic edda
in 1820 hermann goldschmidt of germany noted shadow bands visible just before and after totality at some eclipses
in 1842 george b airy the english astronomer royal saw his first total eclipse of the sun he recalled shadow bands as one of the highlights as the totality approached a strange fluctuation of light was seen upon the walls and the ground so striking that in some places children ran after it and tried to catch it with their hands
in 2008 british astrophysicist stuart eves speculated that shadow bands might be an effect of infrasound which involves the shadow of the moon travelling at supersonic speed and inducing an atmospheric shock wave however astronomy professor barrie jones an expert on shadow bands stated the accepted theory works theres no need to seek an alternative
