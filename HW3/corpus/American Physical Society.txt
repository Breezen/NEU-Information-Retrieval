the american physical society aps is the worlds second largest organization of physicists the society publishes more than a dozen scientific journals including the prestigious physical review and physical review letters and organizes more than twenty science meetings each year aps is a member society of the american institute of physics


 history 
the american physical society was founded on may 20 1899 when thirty-six physicists gathered at columbia university for that purpose they proclaimed the mission of the new society to be to advance and diffuse the knowledge of physics and in one way or another the aps has been at that task ever since in the early years virtually the sole activity of the aps was to hold scientific meetings initially four per year in 1913 the aps took over the operation of the physical review which had been founded in 1893 at cornell university and journal publication became its second major activity the physical review was followed by reviews of modern physics in 1929 and by physical review letters in 1958 over the years phys rev has subdivided into five separate sections as the fields of physics proliferated and the number of submissions grew
in more recent years the activities of the society have broadened considerably stimulated by the increase in federal funding in the period after the second world war and even more by the increased public involvement of scientists in the 1960s the aps is active in public and governmental affairs and in the international physics community in addition the society conducts extensive programs in education science outreach specifically physics outreach and media relations aps has 14 divisions and 11 topical groups covering all areas of physics research there are 6 forums that reflect the interest of its 50,000 members in broader issues and 9 sections organized by geographical region
in 1999 aps physics celebrated its centennial with the biggest-ever physics meeting in atlanta in 2005 aps took the lead role in united states participation in the world year of physics initiating several programs to broadly publicize physics during the 100th anniversary of albert einsteins annus mirabilis einsteinhome one of the projects aps initiated during world year of physics is an ongoing and popular distributed computing project


 name change proposal 
during the summer of 2005 the society conducted an electronic poll in which the majority of aps members preferred the name american physics society the poll became the motivation for a proposal of a name change promised in the leadership election that year however because of legal issues the planned name change was eventually abandoned by the aps executive board
to promote public recognition of aps as a physics society while retaining the name american physical society the aps executive board adopted a new logo incorporating the phrase aps physics general use of aps physics to refer to aps or the american physical society is encouraged the new aps physics logo was designed by kerry g johnson marvin cohen who was then aps president said i like the logo at least now when you are in an elevator at an aps meeting and someone looks at your badge they wont ask you about sports
