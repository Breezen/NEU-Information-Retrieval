the full moon is the lunar phase when the moon appears fully illuminated from earths perspective this occurs when earth is located directly between the sun and the moon more exactly when the ecliptic longitudes of the sun and moon differ by 180° this means that the lunar hemisphere facing earth – the near side – is completely sunlit and appears as a circular disk while the far side is dark the full moon occurs once roughly every month
when the moon moves into earths shadow a lunar eclipse occurs during which all or part of the moons face may appear reddish due to the rayleigh scattering of blue wavelengths and the refraction of sunlight through earths atmosphere lunar eclipses happen only during full moon and around points on its orbit where the satellite may pass through the planets shadow a lunar eclipses does not occur every month because the moons orbit is inclined 5.14° to the ecliptic plane thus the moon usually passes north or south of earths shadow which is mostly restricted to this plane of reference lunar eclipses happen only when the full moon occurs around either node of its orbit ascending or descending therefore a lunar eclipse occurs approximately every 6 months and often 2 weeks before or after a solar eclipse which occurs during new moon around the opposite node
the interval period between a new or full moon and the next same phase a synodic month averages about 29.53 days therefore in those lunar calendars in which each month begins on the day of the new moon the full moon falls on either the 14th or 15th day of the lunar month because a calendar month consists of a whole number of days a lunar month may be either 29 or 30 days long


 characteristics 
a full moon is often thought of as an event of a full nights duration this is somewhat misleading because its phase seen from earth continuously waxes or wanes though much too slowly to notice in real time with the naked eye its maximum illumination occurs at the moment waxing has stopped for any given location about half of these maximum full moons may be visible while the other half occurs during the day when the full moon is below the horizon
many almanacs list full moons not only by date but also by their exact time usually in coordinated universal time utc typical monthly calendars that include lunar phases may be offset by one day when used in a different time zone
full moon is generally a suboptimal time to conduct astronomical observations because the bright sunlight reflected by the moon then outshines the apparently dimmer stars
on 12 december 2008 the full moon occurred closer to the earth than it had been at any time for the previous 15 years called a supermoon
on 19 march 2011 another full supermoon occurred closer to the earth than at any time for the previous 18 years
on 14 november 2016 a full supermoon occurred closer to the earth than at any time for the previous 68 years

where n is the number of full moons since the first full moon of 2000 the true time of a full moon may differ from this approximation by up to about 14.5 hours as a result of the non-circularity of the moons orbit see new moon for an explanation of the formula and its parameters
the age and apparent size of the full moon vary in a cycle of just under 14 synodic months which has been referred to as a full moon cycle


 in folklore and tradition 

full moons are traditionally associated with temporal insomnia inability to sleep insanity hence the terms lunacy and lunatic and various magical phenomena such as lycanthropy psychologists however have found that there is no strong evidence for effects on human behavior around the time of a full moon they find that studies are generally not consistent with some showing a positive effect and others showing a negative effect in one instance the 23 december 2000 issue of the british medical journal published two studies on dog bite admission to hospitals in england and australia the study of the bradford royal infirmary found that dog bites were twice as common during a full moon whereas the study conducted by the public hospitals in australia found that they were less likely all this is relevant to canine rather than human behavior


 full moon names 
historically month names are names of moons lunations not necessarily full moons in lunisolar calendars since the introduction of the solar julian calendar in the roman empire and later the gregorian calendar worldwide people no longer perceive month names as moon names the traditional old english month names were equated with the names of the julian calendar from an early time soon after christianization according to the testimony of bede ca ad 700
some full moons have developed new names in modern times eg the blue moon and the names harvest moon and hunters moon for the full moons of autumn


 harvest and hunters moons 

the harvest moon and hunters moon are traditional terms for the full moons occurring during late summer and in the autumn in the northern hemisphere usually in september and october respectively the harvest moon is the full moon closest to the autumnal equinox 22 or 23 september coming anywhere from two weeks before to two weeks after that date the hunters moon is the full moon following it the names are recorded from the early 18th century the oxford english dictionary entry for harvest moon cites a 1706 reference and for hunters moon a 1710 edition of the british apollo where the term is attributed to the country people the country people call this the hunters-moon the names became traditional in american folklore where they are now often popularly attributed to the native americans the feast of the hunters moon is a yearly festival in west lafayette indiana held in late september or early october each year since 1968 in 2010 the harvest moon occurred on the night of equinox itself some 5​1⁄2 hours after the point of equinox for the first time since 1991
all full moons rise around the time of sunset because the moon moves eastward among the stars faster than the sun its meridian passage is delayed causing it to rise later each day – on average by about 50.47 minutes the harvest moon and hunters moon are unique because the time difference between moonrises on successive evenings is much shorter than average the moon rises approximately 30 minutes later from one night to the next as seen from about 40 degrees n or s latitude this is because a full moon in september appears to move not straight east but north-east in the sky thus there is no long period of darkness between sunset and moonrise for several days following the actual date of the full moon


 farmers almanacs 
the maine farmers almanac from c the 1930s began to publish native american indian full moon names the farmers almanac since 1955 published in maine but not the same publication as the maine farmers almanac continues to do so
an early list of indian month names was published in 1918 by daniel carter beard in his the american boys book of signs signals and symbols for use by the boy scouts beards indian month names were
january difficulty black smoke
february raccoon bare spots on the ground
march wind little grass sore-eye
april ducks goose-eggs
may green grass root-food
june corn-planting strawberry
july buffalo bull hot sun
august harvest cow buffalo
september wild rice red plum
october leaf-falling nuts
november deer-mating fur-pelts
december wolves big moon
such names have gained currency in american folklore they appear in print more widely outside of the almanac tradition from the 1990s in popular publications about the moon mysteries of the moon by patricia haddock great mysteries series greenhaven press 1992 gave an extensive list of such names along with the individual tribal groups they were supposedly associated with haddock supposes that certain colonial american moon names were adopted from algonquian languages which were formerly spoken in the territory of new england while others are based in european tradition eg the colonial american names for the may moon milk moon mothers moon hare moon have no parallels in the supposed native names while the name of november beaver moon is supposedly based in the algonquin
the individual names given in farmers almanac include
january wolf moon this is the name of december in beard 1918 also old moon
february snow moon also hunger moon
march worm moon crow moon sap moon lenten moon
april seed moon pink moon sprouting grass moon egg moon cf goose-egg in beard 1918 fish moon
may milk moon flower moon corn planting moon
june mead moon strawberry moon cf beard 1918 rose moon thunder moon
july hay moon buck moon elk moon thunder moon
august corn moon sturgeon moon red moon green corn moon grain moon
september harvest moon full corn moon
october hunters moon blood moonsanguine moon
november beaver moon frosty moon
december oak moon cold moon long nights moon
the long nights moon is the last of the year and the closest to the winter solstice
ice moon is also used to refer to the first full moon of january or february

 lunar and lunisolar calendars 

most pre-modern calendars the world over were lunisolar combining the solar year with the lunation by means of intercalary months the julian calendar abandoned this method in favour of a purely solar reckoning while conversely the 7th-century islamic calendar opted for a purely lunar one
a continuing lunisolar calendar is in the hebrew calendar evidence of this is noted in the dates of passover and easter in judaism and christianity respectively the date of the jewish rosh hashana and sukkot festivals along with all other jewish holidays are dependent on the dates of the new moons


 intercalary months 

in lunisolar calendars an intercalary month occurs seven times in the 19 years of the metonic cycle or on average every 2.7 years 19/7 in the hebrew calendar this is noted with a periodic extra month of adar in the early spring


 blue moon 

in the modern system of traditional full moon names tied to the solstice and equinox points a supernumerary full moon in such a period is called a blue moon the term blue moon used in this sense may date to as early as the 16th century but it became well known in the united states due to the farmers almanac published since 1818
according to the farmers almanac a blue moon is the third full moon in any period between either solstice and equinox or between equinox and solstice calculated using the mean tropical year which contains four full moons these seasons are equal in length unlike the astronomical ones which vary in length depending on the earths speed in its elliptical orbit round the sun to compare in 1983 the equal length seasons began at 1.48 am on 23 march 9.15 am on 22 june 4.42 pm on 21 september and 12.10 am on 22 december while the astronomical seasons began at 4.39 am on 21 march 11.09 pm on 21 june 2.42 pm on 23 september and 10.30 am on 22 december all times gmt due to a misinterpretation of this definition in the march 1946 sky  telescope magazine blue moon has also been used in the sense of the second full moon in any month which contains two full moons this usage has been noted as erroneous by sky  telescope in 1999 according to either definition blue moons occur with the average frequency of intercalary months seven times in 19 years the farmers almanac system of full moon names effectively defining a lunisolar calendar
