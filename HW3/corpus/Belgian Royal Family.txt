the monarchy of belgium is a constitutional popular and hereditary monarchy whose incumbent is titled the king or queen of the belgians dutch koningin der belgen french roi  reine des belges german königin der belgier and serves as the countrys head of state there have been seven belgian monarchs since independence in 1830
the incumbent philippe ascended the throne on 21 july 2013 following the abdication of his father


 origins 
when belgium became independent in 1830 the national congress chose a constitutional monarchy as the form of government the congress voted on the question on 22 november 1830 supporting monarchy by 174 votes to 13 in february 1831 the congress nominated louis duke of nemours the son of the french king louis-philippe but international considerations deterred louis-philippe from accepting the honour for his son
following this refusal the national congress appointed erasme-louis baron surlet de chokier to be the regent of belgium on 25 february 1831 leopold of saxe-coburg and gotha was designated as king of the belgians by the national congress and swore allegiance to the belgian constitution in front of saint jacobs church at coudenberg palace in brussels on 21 july this day has since become a national holiday for belgium and its citizens


 hereditary and constitutional 
as a hereditary constitutional monarchy system the role and operation of belgiums monarchy is governed by the constitution the royal office of king is designated solely for a descendant of the first king of the belgians leopold i
since he is bound by the constitution above all other ideological and religious considerations political opinions and debates and economic interests the king is intended to act as an arbiter and guardian of belgian national unity and independence belgiums monarchs are inaugurated in a purely civil swearing-in ceremony
the kingdom of belgium was never an absolute monarchy nevertheless in 1961 the historian ramon arango wrote that the belgian monarchy is not truly constitutional


 leopold i leopold ii and albert i 
king leopold i was head of foreign affairs as an ancien régime monarch the foreign ministers having the authority to act only as ministers of the king leopold i quickly became one of the most important shareholders of the société générale de belgique
leopolds son king leopold ii is chiefly remembered for the founding and capitalization of the congo free state which caused public resentment when human rights abuses were made public millions of congolese were killed as a result of leopolds policies in the congo
on several occasions leopold ii publicly expressed disagreement with the ruling government eg on 15 august 1887 and in 1905 against prime minister auguste beernaert and was accused by yvon gouet of noncompliance with the countrys parliamentary system in a similar manner albert i of belgium would later state that he was in command of the belgian army contrary to his prime minister charles de broqueville also against the belgian constitution


 leopold iii and baudouin 
louis wodon the chef de cabinet of leopold iii from 1934 to 1940 thought the kings oath to the constitution implied a royal position over and above the constitution he compared the king to a father the head of a family regarding the moral mission of the king said arango it is permissible to point to a certain analogy between his role and that of a father or more generally of parents in a family the family is of course a legal institution as is the state but what would a family be where everything was limited among those who compose it to simply legal relationships in a family when one considers only legal relationships one comes very close to a breakdown in the moral ties founded on reciprocal affection without which a family would be like any other fragile association according to arango leopold iii of belgium shared these views about the belgian monarchy
in 1991 towards the end of the reign of baudouin senator yves de wasseige a former member of the belgian constitutional court cited four points of democracy which the belgian constitution lacks
the king chooses the ministers
the king is able to influence the ministers when he speaks with them about bills projects and nominations
the king promulgates bills and
the king must agree to any change of the constitution


 constitutional political and historical consequences 
the belgian monarchy was from the beginning a constitutional monarchy patterned after that of the united kingdom raymond fusilier wrote the belgian regime of 1830 was also inspired by the french constitution of the kingdom of france 1791-1792 the united states declaration of independence of 1776 and the old political traditions of both walloon and flemish provinces it should be observed that all monarchies have suffered periods of change as a result of which the power of the sovereign was reduced but for the most part those periods occurred before the development of the system of constitutional monarchy and were steps leading to its establishment the characteristic evidence of this is in great britain where there was an evolution from the time when kings ruled through the agency of ministers to that time when ministers began to govern through the instrumentality of the crown
unlike the british constitutional system in belgium the monarchy underwent a belated evolution which came after the establishment of the constitutional monarchical system because in 1830-1831 an independent state parliamentary system and monarchy were established simultaneously hans daalder professor of political science at the rijksuniversiteit leiden wrote did such simultaneous developments not result in a possible failure to lay down the limits of the royal prerogatives with some precision - which implied that the view of the king as the keeper of the nation with rights and duties of its own retained legitimacy 
for raymond fusilier the belgian monarchy had to be placed - at least in the beginning - between the regimes where the king rules and those in which the king does not rule but only reigns the belgian monarchy is closer to the principle the king does not rule  but the belgian kings were not only at the head of the dignified part of the constitution the belgian monarchy is not merely symbolic because it participates in directing affairs of state insofar as the kings will coincides with that of the ministers who alone bear responsibility for the policy of government for francis delpérée to reign does not only mean to preside over ceremonies but also to take a part in the running of the state the belgian historian jean stengers wrote that some foreigners believe the monarchy is indispensable to national unity that is very naive he is only a piece on the chessboard but a piece which matters


 list of kings of the belgians 

to date all have belonged to the house of saxe-coburg and gotha this is a family tree of the kings of the belgians hereditary constitutional monarchs of belgium as defined by the belgian constitution


 title 
the proper title of the belgian monarch is king of the belgians rather than king of belgium the title indicates a popular monarchy linked to the people of belgium ie a hereditary head of state yet ratified by popular will whereas king of belgium would indicate standard constitutional or absolute monarchy linked to territory or state1 for example in 1830 king louis philippe was proclaimed king of the french rather than king of france the greek monarch was titled king of the hellenes indicating a personal link with the people not just the state moreover the latin translation of king of belgium would have been rex belgii which from 1815 was the name for the king of the netherlands therefore the belgian separatists ie the founders of belgium chose rex belgarum2
belgium is the only current european monarchy that does not apply the tradition of the new monarch automatically ascending the throne upon the death or abdication of the previous monarch according to article 91 of the belgian constitution the monarch accedes to the throne only upon taking a constitutional oath before a joint session of the two houses of parliament the joint session has to be held within ten days of the death of the deceased or abdicated king the new belgian monarch is required to take the belgian constitutional oath i swear to observe the constitution and the laws of the belgian people to maintain the national independence and the integrity of the territory which is uttered in the three official languages french dutch and german
members of the belgian royal family are often known by two names a dutch and a french one for example the current monarch is called philippe in french and filip in dutch the fifth king of the belgians was baudouin in french and boudewijn in dutch
in contrast to king philippes title of king of the belgians princess elisabeth is called princess of belgium as the title prince of the belgians does not exist she is also duchess of brabant the traditional title of the heir apparent to the belgian throne this title precedes the title princess of belgium
in the other official language of german monarchs are usually referred to by their french names the same is true for english with the exception of leopold where the accent is removed for the purpose of simplicity
because of the first world war and the resultant strong anti-german sentiment the family name was changed in 1920 from saxe-coburg-gotha to van belgië de belgique or von belgien of belgium depending upon which of the countrys three official languages dutch french and german is in use it is this family name which is used on the identity cards and in all official documents by belgiums royalty eg marriage licenses in addition to this change of name the armorial bearings of saxony were removed from the belgian royal coat of arms see above other coburgers from the multi-branched saxe-coburg family have also changed their name such as george v who adopted the family name of windsor after the british royal family’s place of residence


 constitutional role 

the belgian monarchy symbolises and maintains a feeling of national unity by representing the country in public functions and international meetings
in addition the monarch has a number of responsibilities in the process of the formation of the government the procedure usually begins with the nomination of the informateur by the monarch after the general election the informateur officially informs the monarch of the main political formations which may be available for governance after this phase the monarch can appoint another informateur or appoint a formateur who will have the charge of forming a new government of which he or she generally becomes the prime minister
the constitution of belgium entrusts the monarch with federal executive powers the appointment and dismissal of ministers the implementation of the laws passed by the federal parliament the submission of bills to the federal parliament and the management of international relations the monarch sanctions and promulgates all laws passed by parliament in accordance with article 106 of the belgian constitution the monarch cannot act without the countersignature of the responsible minister who in doing so assumes political responsibility this means that federal executive power is exercised in practice by the federal government which is accountable to the chamber of representatives in accordance with article 101 of the constitution
the monarch receives the prime minister at the palace of brussels at least once a week and also regularly calls other members of the government to the palace in order to discuss political matters during these meetings the monarch has the right to be informed of proposed governmental policies the right to advise and the right to warn on any matter as the monarch sees fit the monarch also holds meetings with the leaders of all the major political parties and regular members of parliament all of these meetings are organised by the monarchs personal political cabinet which is part of the royal household
the monarch is the commander-in-chief of the belgian armed forces and makes appointments to the higher positions the names of the nominees are sent to the monarch by the ministry of defence the monarchs military duties are carried out with the help of the military household which is headed by a general office belgians may write to the monarch when they meet difficulties with administrative powers
the monarch is also one of the three components of the federal legislative power in accordance with the belgian constitution together with the two chambers of the federal parliament the chamber of representatives and the senate all laws passed by the federal parliament must be signed and promulgated by the monarch
previously children of the king were entitled to a seat in the senate senator by right when they were 18 this right was abolished in 2014 as part of the sixth belgian state reform


 inviolability 

article 88 of the belgian constitution provides that the kings person is inviolable his ministers are responsible this means that the king cannot be prosecuted arrested or convicted of crimes cannot be summoned to appear before a civil court and is not accountable to the federal parliament this inviolability was deemed incompatible however with article 27 of the rome statute of the international criminal court which states that official capacity shall not exempt a person from criminal responsibility under the statute


 traditions 
the court still keeps some old traditions most famous is the tradition that the reigning king of the belgians becomes the godfather of the 7th son and the queen the godmother of the 7th daughter the child is then given the name of the sovereign and receives a gift from the palace and lord mayor of the city another tradition is the centuries old ceremonial welcome the new king receives in the country during the joyous entry this tradition goes back to the dukes of brabant


 popular support 
the belgian monarchy enjoys a lower degree of support than other european monarchies and is often questioned popular support for the monarchy has historically been higher in flanders and lower in wallonia the generally pro-monarchy catholic party and later christian social party dominated in flanders while the more industrialised wallonia had more support for the belgian labour party and later socialist party for example the 1950 referendum saw flanders voting strongly in favour of king leopold iii returning whereas wallonia was largely against however in recent decades these roles have reversed as religiosity in flanders has decreased and the king is seen as protecting the country against flemish separatism and the countrys partition
