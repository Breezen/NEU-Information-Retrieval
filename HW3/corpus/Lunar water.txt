lunar water is water that is present on the moon liquid water cannot persist at the moons surface and water vapor is decomposed by sunlight with hydrogen quickly lost to outer space however scientists have since the 1960s conjectured that water ice could survive in cold permanently shadowed craters at the moons poles water molecules are also detected in the thin layer of gases above the lunar surface
water h2o and the chemically related hydroxyl group -oh can also exist in forms chemically bound as hydrates and hydroxides to lunar minerals rather than as free water and evidence strongly suggests that this is indeed the case in low concentrations over much of the moons surface in fact adsorbed water is calculated to exist at trace concentrations of 10 to 1000 parts per million in 1978 it was reported that samples returned by the soviet luna 24 probe contained 0.1% water by mass sample inconclusive evidence of free water ice at the lunar poles was accumulated from a variety of observations suggesting the presence of bound hydrogen
on 18 november 2008 the moon impact probe was released from indias chandrayaan-1 at a height of 100 kilometres 62 mi during its 25-minute descent the impact probes chandras altitudinal composition chace recorded evidence of water in 650 mass spectra gathered in the thin atmosphere above the moons surface in september 2009 nasa payload moon mineralogy mapper onboard chandrayaan-1 detected water on the moon surface and hydroxyl absorption lines in reflected sunlight in november 2009 nasa re-confirmed water on moon with its lcross space probe which detected a significant amount of hydroxyl group in the material thrown up from a south polar crater by an impactor this may be attributed to water-bearing materials – what appears to be near pure crystalline water-ice in march 2010 it was reported that the mini-sar on board chandrayaan-1 had discovered more than 40 permanently darkened craters near the moons north pole that are hypothesized to contain an estimated 600 million metric tonnes 1.3 trillion pounds of water-ice
water may have been delivered to the moon over geological timescales by the regular bombardment of water-bearing comets asteroids and meteoroids  or continuously produced in situ by the hydrogen ions protons of the solar wind impacting oxygen-bearing minerals
the search for the presence of lunar water has attracted considerable attention and motivated several recent lunar missions largely because of waters usefulness in rendering long-term lunar habitation feasible


 lunar water discovery 

on 24 september 2009 science magazine reported that the moon mineralogy mapper m3 on the indian space research organisations isro chandrayaan-1 had detected water on the moon m3 detected absorption features near 2.8–3.0 μm 0.00011–0.00012 in on the surface of the moon for silicate bodies such features are typically attributed to hydroxyl- andor water-bearing materials on the moon the feature is seen as a widely distributed absorption that appears strongest at cooler high latitudes and at several fresh feldspathic craters the general lack of correlation of this feature in sunlit m3 data with neutron spectrometer h abundance data suggests that the formation and retention of oh and h2o is an ongoing surficial process ohh2o production processes may feed polar cold traps and make the lunar regolith a candidate source of volatiles for human exploration
the moon mineralogy mapper m3 an imaging spectrometer was one of the 11 instruments on board chandrayaan-1 whose mission came to a premature end on 29 august 2009 m3 was aimed at providing the first mineral map of the entire lunar surface
lunar scientists had discussed the possibility of water repositories for decades they are now increasingly confident that the decades-long debate is over a report says the moon in fact has water in all sorts of places not just locked up in minerals but scattered throughout the broken-up surface and potentially in blocks or sheets of ice at depth the results from the chandrayaan mission are also offering a wide array of watery signals


 history of observations 


 20th century 
apollo program
the possibility of ice in the floors of polar lunar craters was first suggested in 1961 by caltech researchers kenneth watson bruce c murray and harrison brown although trace amounts of water were found in lunar rock samples collected by apollo astronauts this was assumed to be a result of contamination and the majority of the lunar surface was generally assumed to be completely dry however a 2008 study of lunar rock samples revealed evidence of water molecules trapped in volcanic glass beads
the first direct evidence of water vapor near the moon was obtained by the apollo 14 alsep suprathermal ion detector experiment side on march 7 1971 a series of bursts of water vapor ions were observed by the instrument mass spectrometer at the lunar surface near the apollo 14 landing site
luna 24
in february 1978 soviet scientists m akhmanova b dementev and m markov of the vernadsky institute of geochemistry and analytic chemistry published a paper claiming a detection of water fairly definitively their study showed that the samples returned to earth by the 1976 soviet probe luna 24 contained about 0.1% water by mass as seen in infrared absorption spectroscopy at about 3 μm 0.00012 in wavelength at a detection level about 10 times above the threshold
clementine mission

a proposed evidence of water ice on the moon came in 1994 from the united states military clementine probe in an investigation known as the bistatic radar experiment clementine used its transmitter to beam radio waves into the dark regions of the south pole of the moon echoes of these waves were detected by the large dish antennas of the deep space network on earth the magnitude and polarisation of these echoes was consistent with an icy rather than rocky surface but the results were inconclusive and their significance has been questioned earth-based radar measurements were used to identify the areas that are in permanent shadow and hence have the potential to harbour lunar ice estimates of the total extent of shadowed areas poleward of 87.5 degrees latitude are 1,030 and 2,550 square kilometres 400 and 980 sq mi for the north and south poles respectively subsequent computer simulations encompassing additional terrain suggested that an area up to 14,000 square kilometres 5,400 sq mi might be in permanent shadow
lunar prospector
the lunar prospector probe launched in 1998 employed a neutron spectrometer to measure the amount of hydrogen in the lunar regolith near the polar regions it was able to determine hydrogen abundance and location to within 50 parts per million and detected enhanced hydrogen concentrations at the lunar north and south poles these were interpreted as indicating significant amounts of water ice trapped in permanently shadowed craters but could also be due to the presence of the hydroxyl radical •oh chemically bound to minerals based on data from clementine and lunar prospector nasa scientists have estimated that if surface water ice is present the total quantity could be of the order of 1–3 cubic kilometres 0.24–0.72 cu mi in july 1999 at the end of its mission the lunar prospector probe was deliberately crashed into shoemaker crater near the moons south pole in the hope that detectable quantities of water would be liberated however spectroscopic observations from ground-based telescopes did not reveal the spectral signature of water
cassini–huygens
more suspicions about the existence of water on the moon were generated by inconclusive data produced by cassini–huygens mission which passed the moon in 1999


 21st century 
deep impact
in 2005 observations of the moon by the deep impact spacecraft produced inconclusive spectroscopic data suggestive of water on the moon in 2006 observations with the arecibo planetary radar showed that some of the near-polar clementine radar returns previously claimed to be indicative of ice might instead be associated with rocks ejected from young craters if true this would indicate that the neutron results from lunar prospector were primarily from hydrogen in forms other than ice such as trapped hydrogen molecules or organics nevertheless the interpretation of the arecibo data do not exclude the possibility of water ice in permanently shadowed craters in june 2009 nasas deep impact spacecraft now redesignated epoxi made further confirmatory bound hydrogen measurements during another lunar flyby
kaguya
as part of its lunar mapping programme japans kaguya probe launched in september 2007 for a 19-month mission carried out gamma ray spectrometry observations from orbit that can measure the abundances of various elements on the moons surface japans kaguya probes high resolution imaging sensors failed to detect any signs of water ice in permanently shaded craters around the south pole of the moon and it ended its mission by crashing into the lunar surface in order to study the ejecta plume content
change 1
the peoples republic of chinas change 1 orbiter launched in october 2007 took the first detailed photographs of some polar areas where ice water is likely to be found

chandrayaan-1
on november 14 2008 the indian spacecraft chandrayaan-1 released the moon impact probe mip that impacted shackleton crater of the lunar south pole at 2031 on 14 november 2008 releasing subsurface debris that was analyzed for presence of water ice on 25 september 2009 isro announced that the mip had discovered water on the moon just before impact this announcement was made after the discovery of water was announced on september 24 2009 by science magazine by the nasa payload moon mineralogy mapper carried on board chandrayaan-1 mip discovered water on moon before nasas moon mineralogy mapper but the announcement of this discovery was not made until nasa confirmed it
on september 25 2009 nasa declared that data sent from its moon mineralogy mapper m3 instrument aboard chandrayaan-1 orbiter confirmed the existence of hydrogen over large areas of the moons surface albeit in low concentrations and in the form of hydroxyl group  · oh chemically bound to soil this supports earlier evidence from spectrometers aboard the deep impact and cassini probes
on march 2010 it was reported that the mini-sar on board chandrayaan-1 had discovered more than 40 permanently darkened craters near the moons north pole that are hypothesized to contain an estimated 600 million metric tonnes of water-ice the radars high cpr is not uniquely diagnostic of either roughness or ice the science team must take into account the environment of the occurrences of high cpr signal to interpret its cause the ice must be relatively pure and at least a couple of meters thick to give this signature  the estimated amount of water ice potentially present is comparable to the quantity estimated from the previous mission of lunar prospectors neutron data
although the results are consistent with recent findings of other nasa instruments onboard chandrayaan-1 the moon mineralogy mapper mp3 discovered water molecules in the moons polar regions while water vapor was detected by nasas lunar crater observation and sensing satellite or lcross this observation is not consistent with the presence of thick deposits of nearly pure water ice within a few meters of the lunar surface but it does not rule out the presence of small ∼10 cm 3.9 in discrete pieces of ice mixed in with the regolith
lunar reconnaissance orbiter
the search for lunar ice continued with nasas lunar reconnaissance orbiter lro  lcross mission launched june 18 2009 lros onboard instruments carried out a variety of observations that may provide further evidence of water on october 9 2009 the centaur upper stage of its atlas v carrier rocket was directed to impact cabeus crater at 1131 utc followed shortly by the lcross spacecraft that flew into the ejecta plume and attempted to detect the presence of water vapor in the debris cloud although no immediate spectacular plume was seen time was needed to analyze the spectrometry data on november 13 2009 nasa reported that after analysis of the data obtained from the ejecta plume the spectral signature of water had been confirmed however what was actually detected was the chemical group hydroxyl  · oh which is suspected to be from water but could also be hydrates which are inorganic salts containing chemically-bound water molecules the nature concentration and distribution of this material requires further analysis chief mission scientist anthony colaprete has stated that the ejecta appears to include a range of fine-grained particulates of near pure crystalline water-ice a later definitive analysis found the concentration of water to be 5.6 ± 2.9% by mass the mini-rf instrument on lro observed the lcross landing site and did not detect any evidence of large slabs of water ice so the water is most likely present as small pieces of ice mixed in with the lunar regolith
lros laser altimeters examination of the shackleton crater at the lunar south pole suggests up to 22% of the surface of that crater is covered in ice
melt inclusions in apollo 17 samples
in may 2011 erik hauri et al reported 615-1410 ppm water in melt inclusions in lunar sample 74220 the famous high-titanium orange glass soil of volcanic origin collected during the apollo 17 mission in 1972 the inclusions were formed during explosive eruptions on the moon approximately 3.7 billion years ago
this concentration is comparable with that of magma in earths upper mantle while of considerable selenological interest this announcement affords little comfort to would-be lunar colonists the sample originated many kilometers below the surface and the inclusions are so difficult to access that it took 39 years to detect them with a state-of-the-art ion microprobe instrument


 possible water cycle 


 production 
lunar water has two potential origins water-bearing comets and other bodies striking the moon and in situ production it has been theorized that the latter may occur when hydrogen ions protons in the solar wind chemically combine with the oxygen atoms present in the lunar minerals oxides silicates etc to produce small amounts of water trapped in the minerals crystal lattices or as hydroxyl groups potential water precursors this mineral-bound water or hydroxylated mineral surface must not be confused with water ice
the hydroxyl surface groups s–oh formed by the reaction of protons h with oxygen atoms accessible at oxide surface so could further be converted in water molecules h2o adsorbed onto the oxide minerals surface the mass balance of a chemical rearrangement supposed at the oxide surface could be schematically written as follows
2 s-oh — so  s  h2o
or
2 s-oh — s–o–s  h2o

where s represents the oxide surface
the formation of one water molecule requires the presence of two adjacent hydroxyl groups or a cascade of successive reactions of one oxygen atom with two protons this could constitute a limiting factor and decreases the probability of water production if the proton density per surface unit is too low


 trapping 
solar radiation would normally strip any free water or water ice from the lunar surface splitting it into its constituent elements hydrogen and oxygen which then escape to space however because of the only very slight axial tilt of the moons spin axis to the ecliptic plane 1.5 ° some deep craters near the poles never receive any sunlight and are permanently shadowed see for example shackleton crater and whipple crater the temperature in these regions never rises above about 100 k about −170 ° celsius and any water that eventually ended up in these craters could remain frozen and stable for extremely long periods of time — perhaps billions of years depending on the stability of the orientation of the moons axis


 transport 
although free water cannot persist in illuminated regions of the moon any such water produced there by the action of the solar wind on lunar minerals might through a process of evaporation and condensation migrate to permanently cold polar areas and accumulate there as ice perhaps in addition to any ice brought by comet impacts
the hypothetical mechanism of water transport  trapping if any remains unknown indeed lunar surfaces directly exposed to the solar wind where water production occurs are too hot to allow trapping by water condensation and solar radiation also continuously decomposes water while no or much less water production is expected in the cold areas not directly exposed to the sun given the expected short lifetime of water molecules in illuminated regions a short transport distance would in principle increase the probability of trapping in other words water molecules produced close to a cold dark polar crater should have the highest probability of surviving and being trapped
to what extent and at what spatial scale direct proton exchange protolysis and proton surface diffusion directly occurring at the naked surface of oxyhydroxide minerals exposed to space vacuum see surface diffusion and self-ionization of water could also play a role in the mechanism of the water transfer towards the coldest point is presently unknown and remains a conjecture


 uses 
the presence of large quantities of water on the moon would be an important factor in rendering lunar habitation cost-effective since transporting water or hydrogen and oxygen from earth would be prohibitively expensive if future investigations find the quantities to be particularly large water ice could be mined to provide liquid water for drinking and plant propagation and the water could also be split into hydrogen and oxygen by solar panel-equipped electric power stations or a nuclear generator providing breathable oxygen as well as the components of rocket fuel the hydrogen component of the water ice could also be used to draw out the oxides in the lunar soil and harvest even more oxygen
analysis of lunar ice would also provide scientific information about the impact history of the moon and the abundance of comets and asteroids in the early inner solar system


 ownership 
the hypothetical discovery of usable quantities of water on the moon may raise legal questions about who owns the water and who has the right to exploit it the united nations outer space treaty does not prevent the exploitation of lunar resources but does prevent the appropriation of the moon by individual nations and is generally interpreted as barring countries from claiming ownership of in-situ resources however most legal experts agree that the ultimate test of the question will arise through precedents of national or private activity some private companies such as shackleton energy company are already asserting their right to own whatever resources they remove andor benefit from the moon or asteroids through their own effort risk and investment the moon treaty specifically stipulates that exploitation of lunar resources is to be governed by an international regime but this treaty has not been ratified by any of the major space-faring nations
