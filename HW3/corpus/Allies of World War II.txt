the allies of world war ii called the united nations from the 1 january 1942 declaration were the countries that together opposed the axis powers during the second world war 1939–1945 the allies promoted the alliance as seeking to stop german japanese and italian aggression
at the start of the war on 1 september 1939 the allies consisted of france poland and the united kingdom and dependent states such as british india within days they were joined by the independent dominions of the british commonwealth australia canada new zealand and south africa after the start of the german invasion of north europe till the balkan campaign the netherlands belgium greece and yugoslavia joined the allies after first having cooperated with germany in invading poland whilst remaining neutral in the allied-axis conflict the soviet union perforce joined the allies in june 1941 after being invaded by germany the united states provided war material and money all along and officially joined in december 1941 after the japanese attack on pearl harbor china had already been in a prolonged war with japan since the marco polo bridge incident of 1937 but officially joined the allies in 1941
the alliance was formalised by the declaration by united nations from 1 january 1942 however the name united nations was rarely used to describe the allies during the war the leaders of the big three – the soviet union the united kingdom and the united states – controlled allied strategy relations between the united kingdom and the united states were especially close china and the big three were referred as a trusteeship of the powerful then were recognized as the allied big four in a declaration by united nations and later as the four policemen of the united nations
in 1945 the allied nations became the basis of the united nations


 origins and creation 

the origins of the allied powers stem from the allies of world war i and cooperation of the victorious powers at the paris peace conference 1919 germany resented signing treaty of versailles the new weimar republics legitimacy became shaken however the 1920s were peaceful
with the stock market crash of 1929 and the ensuing great depression political unrest in europe soared including the rise in support of revanchist nationalists in germany who blamed the severity of the economic crisis on the treaty of versailles by the early 1930s the nazi party led by adolf hitler became the dominant revanchist movement in germany and hitler and the nazis gained power in 1933 the nazi regime demanded the immediate cancellation of the treaty of versailles and made claims to german-populated austria and german-populated territories of czechoslovakia the likelihood of war was high and the question was whether it could be avoided through strategies such as appeasement
in asia when japan seized manchuria in 1931 the league of nations condemned it for aggression against china japan responded by leaving the league of nations in march 1933 after four quiet years the sino-japanese war erupted in 1937 with japanese forces invading china the league of nations condemned japans actions and initiated sanctions on japan the united states in particular was angered at japan and sought to support china

in march 1939 germany took over czechoslovakia violating the munich agreement signed six months before and demonstrating that the appeasement policy was a failure britain and france decided that hitler had no intention to uphold diplomatic agreements and responded by preparing for war on 31 march 1939 britain formed the anglo-polish military alliance in an effort to avert a german attack on the country also the french had a long-standing alliance with poland since 1921 the soviet union sought an alliance with the western powers but hitler ended the risk of a war with stalin by signing the nazi–soviet non-aggression pact in august 1939 the agreement secretly divided the independent nations of eastern europe between the two powers and assured adequate oil supplies for the german war machine on 1 september 1939 germany invaded poland two days later britain and france declared war on germany then on 17 september 1939 the soviet union invaded poland from the east a polish government-in-exile was set up and it continued to be one of the allies a model followed by other occupied countries after a quiet winter germany in april 1940 invaded and quickly defeated denmark norway belgium the netherlands and france britain and its empire stood alone against hitler and mussolini in june 1941 hitler broke the non-aggression agreement with stalin and germany invaded the soviet union in december japan attacked the us and britain the main lines of world war ii had formed


 major affiliated state combatants 

during december 1941 us president franklin d roosevelt devised the name united nations for the allies and proposed it to british prime minister winston churchill he referred to the big three and china as a trusteeship of the powerful and then later the four policemen the declaration by united nations on 1 january 1942 was the basis of the modern united nations un at the potsdam conference of july–august 1945 roosevelts successor harry s truman proposed that the foreign ministers of china france the soviet union the united kingdom and the united states should draft the peace treaties and boundary settlements of europe which led to the creation of the council of foreign ministers of the big five and soon thereafter the establishment of those states as the permanent members of the unsc

southern rhodesia was a self-governing colony having received responsible government in 1923 it was not a sovereign dominion it governed itself internally and controlled its own armed forces but had no diplomatic autonomy and therefore was officially at war as soon as britain was at war the southern rhodesian colonial government issued a symbolic declaration of war nevertheless on 3 september 1939 which made no difference diplomatically but preceded the declarations of war made by all other british dominions and colonies

 china 

in the 1920s the soviet union provided military assistance to the kuomintang or the nationalists and helped reorganize their party along leninist lines a unification of party state and army in exchange the nationalists agreed to let members of the chinese communist party join the nationalists on an individual basis however following the nominal unification of china at the end of the northern expedition in 1928 generalissimo chiang kai-shek purged leftists from his party and fought against the revolting chinese communist party former warlords and other militarist factions a fragmented china provided easy opportunities for japan to gain territories piece by piece without engaging in total war following the 1931 mukden incident the puppet state of manchukuo was established throughout the early to mid-1930s chiangs anti-communist and anti-militarist campaigns continued while he fought small incessant conflicts against japan usually followed by unfavorable settlements and concessions after military defeats
in 1936 chiang was forced to cease his anti-communist military campaigns after his kidnap and release by zhang xueliang and reluctantly formed a nominal alliance with the communists while the communists agreed to fight under the nominal command of the nationalists against the japanese following the marco polo bridge incident of 7 july 1937 china and japan became embroiled in a full-scale war the soviet union wishing to keep china in the fight against japan supplied china with military assistance until 1941 when it signed a non-aggression pact with japan continuous clashes between the communists and nationalists behind enemy lines cumulated in a major military conflict between these two former allies that effectively ended their cooperation against the japanese and china had been divided between the internationally recognized nationalist china under the leadership of generalissimo chiang kai-shek and communist china under the leadership of mao zedong until the japanese surrendered in 1945


 factions 


 nationalists 

prior to the alliance of germany and italy to japan the nationalist government held close relations with both germany and italy in the early 1930s sino-german cooperation between the nationalist government and germany in military and industrial matters nazi germany provided the largest proportion of chinese arms imports and technical expertise relations between the nationalist government and italy during the 1930s varied however even after the nationalist government followed league of nations sanctions against italy for its invasion of ethiopia the international sanctions proved unsuccessful and relations between the fascist government in italy and the nationalist government in china returned to normal shortly afterwards up until 1936 mussolini had provided the nationalists with italian military air and naval missions to help the nationalists fight against japanese incursions and communist insurgents italy also held strong commercial interests and a strong commercial position in china supported by the italian concession in tianjin however after 1936 the relationship between the nationalist government and italy changed due to a japanese diplomatic proposal to recognize the italian empire that included occupied ethiopia within it in exchange for italian recognition of manchukuo italian foreign minister galeazzo ciano accepted this offer by japan and on 23 october 1936 japan recognized the italian empire and italy recognized manchukuo as well as discussing increasing commercial links between italy and japan
the nationalist government held close relations with the united states the united states opposed japans invasion of china in 1937 that it considered an illegal violation of chinas sovereignty and offered the nationalist government diplomatic economic and military assistance during its war against japan in particular the united states sought to bring the japanese war effort to a complete halt by imposing a full embargo on all trade between the united states to japan japan was dependent on the united states for 80 percent of its petroleum resulting in an economic and military crisis for japan that could not continue its war effort with china without access to petroleum in november 1940 american military aviator claire lee chennault upon observing the dire situation in the air war between china and japan set out to organize a volunteer squadron of american fighter pilots to fight alongside the chinese against japan known as the flying tigers us president franklin d roosevelt accepted dispatching them to china in early 1941 however they only became operational shortly after the attack on pearl harbor
the soviet union recognised the republic of china but urged reconciliation with the communist party of china and inclusion of communists in the government the soviet union also urged military and cooperation between nationalist china and communist china during the war
even though china had been fighting the longest among all the allied powers it only officially joined the allies after the attack on pearl harbor on 7 december 1941 china fought the japanese empire before joining the allies in the pacific war generalissimo chiang kai-shek thought allied victory was assured with the entrance of the united states into the war and he declared war on germany and the other axis nations however allied aid remained low because the burma road was closed and the allies suffered a series of military defeats against japan early on in the campaign general sun li-jen led the roc forces to the relief of 7,000 british forces trapped by the japanese in the battle of yenangyaung he then reconquered north burma and re-established the land route to china by the ledo road but the bulk of military aid did not arrive until the spring of 1945 more than 1.5 million japanese troops were trapped in the china theatre troops that otherwise could have been deployed elsewhere if china had collapsed and made a separate peace


 communists 

communist china had been tacitly supported by the soviet union since the 1920s though the soviet union diplomatically recognised the republic of china joseph stalin supported cooperation between the nationalists and the communists—including pressuring the nationalist government to grant the communists state and military positions in the government this was continued into the 1930s that fell in line with the soviet unions subversion policy of popular fronts to increase communists influence in governments the soviet union urged military and cooperation between soviet china and nationalist china during chinas war against japan initially mao zedong accepted the demands of the soviet union and in 1938 had recognized chiang kai-shek as the leader of the chinese people in turn the soviet union accepted maos tactic of continuous guerilla warfare in the countryside that involved a goal of extending the communist bases even if it would result in increased tensions with the nationalists
after the breakdown of their cooperation with the nationalists in 1941 the communists prospered and grew as the war against japan dragged on building up their sphere of influence wherever opportunities were presented mainly through rural mass organizations administrative land and tax reform measures favoring poor peasants while the nationalists attempted to neutralize the spread of communist influence by military blockade and fighting the japanese at the same time
the communist partys position in china was boosted further upon the soviet invasion of manchuria in august 1945 against the japanese puppet state of manchukuo and the japanese kwantung army in china and manchuria upon the intervention of the soviet union against japan in world war ii in 1945 mao zedong in april and may 1945 had planned to mobilize 150,000 to 250,000 soldiers from across china to work with forces of the soviet union in capturing manchuria


 france 


 war declared 

after germany invaded poland france declared war on germany on 3 september 1939 in january 1940 french prime minister édouard daladier made a major speech denouncing the actions of germany

at the end of five months of war one thing has become more and more clear it is that germany seeks to establish a domination of the world completely different from any known in world history
the domination at which the nazis aim is not limited to the displacement of the balance of power and the imposition of the supremacy of one nation it seeks the systematic and total destruction of those conquered by hitler and it does not treaty with the nations which it has subdued he destroys them he takes from them their whole political and economic existence and seeks even to deprive them of their history and culture he wishes only to consider them as vital space and a vacant territory over which he has every right
the human beings who constitute these nations are for him only cattle he orders their massacre or migration he compels them to make room for their conquerors he does not even take the trouble to impose any war tribute on them he just takes all their wealth and to prevent any revolt he scientifically seeks the physical and moral degradation of those whose independence he has taken away

france experienced several major phases of action during world war ii
the phoney war of 1939–1940 also called drôle de guerre in france dziwna wojna in poland both meaning strange war or the sitzkrieg sitting war in germany

the period of resistance against the occupation and franco-french struggle for control of the colonies between the vichy regime and the free french who continued the fight on the allies side after the appeal of 18 june by general charles de gaulle recognized by the united kingdom as frances government-in-exile it culminated in the allied landings in north africa on 11 november 1942 when vichy ceased to exist as an independent entity after having been invaded by both the axis and the allies simultaneously being thereafter only the nominal government in charge during the occupation of france vichy forces in french north africa switched allegiance and merged with the free french to participate in the campaigns of tunisia and of italy and the invasion of corsica in 1943–44
the liberation of mainland france beginning with d-day on 6 june 1944 and operation overlord and then with operation dragoon on 15 august 1944 leading to the liberation of paris on 25 august 1944 by the free french 2e division blindée and the installation of the provisional government of the french republic in the newly liberated capital

the soviet union intervened against japan and its client state in manchuria in 1945 cooperating with the nationalist government of china and the nationalist party led by chiang kai-shek though also cooperating preferring and encouraging the communist party led by mao zedong to take effective control of manchuria after expelling japanese forces


 history

on 20 august 1939 forces of the union of soviet socialist republics under general georgy zhukov together with the peoples republic of mongolia eliminated the threat of conflict in the east with a decisive victory over japan at the battle of khalkhin gol in eastern mongolia
on the same day soviet party leader joseph stalin received a telegram from german chancellor adolf hitler suggesting that german foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop fly to moscow for diplomatic talks after receiving a lukewarm response throughout the spring and summer stalin abandoned attempts for a better diplomatic relationship with france and the united kingdom

 brazil 

initially brazil maintained a position of neutrality trading with both the allies and the axis powers while brazilian president getúlio vargass quasi-fascist policies indicated a leaning toward the axis powers however as the war progressed trade with the axis countries became almost impossible and the united states initiated forceful diplomatic and economic efforts to bring brazil onto the allied side

with gratitude for the past and confidence in the future we range ourselves without fear beside britain where she goes we go where she stands we stand we are only a small and young nation but we march with a union of hearts and souls to a common destiny
