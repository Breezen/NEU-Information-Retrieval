the wolf number also known as the international sunspot number relative sunspot number or z√ºrich number is a quantity that measures the number of sunspots and groups of sunspots present on the surface of the sun


 history 
the idea of computing sunspot numbers was originated by rudolf wolf in 1848 in zurich switzerland and thus the procedure he initiated bears his name or place the combination of sunspots and their grouping is used because it compensates for variations in observing small sunspots
this number has been collected and tabulated by researchers for over 150 years they have found that sunspot activity is cyclical and reaches its maximum around every 9.5 to 11 years this cycle was first noted by heinrich schwabe in 1843
due to weather and researcher unavailability the sunspot count is actually an average of observations by multiple people in multiple locations with different equipment with a scaling factor k assigned to each observer to compensate for their differing ability to resolve small sunspots and their subjective division of groups of sunspots
the relative sunspot number

   is computed using the formula collected as a daily index of sunspot activity

 revision 
since 1 july 2015 a revised and updated list of the sunspot numbers has been made available the biggest difference is an overall increase by a factor of 1.6 to the entire series traditionally a scaling of 0.6 was applied to all sunspot counts after 1893 to compensate for alfred wolfers better equipment after taking over from wolf this scaling has been dropped from the revised series making modern counts closer to their raw values also counts were reduced slightly after 1947 to compensate for bias introduced by a new counting method adopted that year in which sunspots are weighted according to their size
however alternative group sunspot number series exist  suggesting different behavior of sunspot activity before the 20th century thus the solar variability before the 20th centuries remains quite uncertain
