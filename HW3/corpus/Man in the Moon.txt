the man in the moon refers to any of several pareidolic images of a human face head or body that certain traditions recognise in the disc of the full moon the images are composed of the dark areas of the lunar maria or seas and the lighter highlands of the lunar surface


 examples and occurrence globally 
one older european tradition sees a figure of a man carrying a wide burden on his back he is sometimes seen as accompanied by a small dog various cultures recognise other examples of lunar pareidolia such as the moon rabbit
in the northern hemisphere a common western perception of the face has it that the figures eyes are mare imbrium and mare serenitatis its nose is sinus aestuum and its open mouth is mare nubium and mare cognitum this particular human face can also be seen in tropical regions on both sides of the equator however the moon orientation associated with the face is observed less frequently—and eventually not at all—as one moves towards the south pole
conventionalized illustrations of the man in the moon seen in western art often show a very simple face in the full moon or a human profile in the crescent moon corresponding to no actual markings
the man in the moon can also refer to a mythological character said to live on or in the moon but who is not necessarily represented by the markings on the face of the moon an example is yue-laou from chinese tradition


 origin stories 
there are various explanations for how the man in the moon came to be

one medieval christian tradition claims him to be cain the wanderer forever doomed to circle the earth dantes inferno alludes to this

this is mentioned again in his paradise

in the english middle ages and renaissance the moon was held to be the god of drunkards and at least three london taverns were named the man in the moone the man in the moon is named in an early dated english nursery rhyme


 scientific explanation 
the man in the moon is made up of various lunar maria which ones depends on the pareidolic image seen these vast flat spots on the moon are called maria or seas because for a long time astronomers believed they were large bodies of water they are large areas formed by lava that covered up old craters and then cooled becoming smooth basalt rock
the near side of the moon containing these maria that make up the man is always facing earth this is due to a tidal locking or synchronous orbit thought to have occurred because of the gravitational forces partially caused by the moons oblong shape its rotation has slowed to the point where it rotates exactly once on each trip around the earth this causes the near side of the moon to always turn its face toward earth
