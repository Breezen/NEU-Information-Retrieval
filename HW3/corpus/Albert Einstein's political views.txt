 einstein and germany 

born in ulm einstein was a german citizen from birth as he grew older einsteins pacifism often clashed with the german empires militant views at the time at the age of 17 einstein renounced his german citizenship and moved to switzerland to attend college the loss of einsteins citizenship allowed him to avoid service in the military which suited his pacifist views in response to a manifesto of the ninety-three signed by 93 leading german intellectuals including max planck in support of the german war effort einstein and three others wrote a counter-manifesto einstein accepted a position at the university of berlin in 1914 returning to germany where he spent his time during the rest of world war i einstein also reacquired his german citizenship in the years after the war einstein was very vocal in his support for germany in 1918 einstein was one of the founding members of the german democratic party in 1921 einstein refused to attend the third solvay congress in belgium as his german compatriots were excluded in 1922 einstein joined a committee sponsored by the league of nations but quickly left when the league refused to act on frances occupation of the ruhr in 1923 as a member of the german league of human rights einstein worked hard to repair relations between germany and france
einstein moved to the united states in december 1932 where he worked at the california institute of technology in pasadena california and lectured at abraham flexners newly founded institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey einstein renounced his german citizenship in 1933 due to the rise of adolf hitler and the nazi party
during the 1930s and into world war ii einstein wrote affidavits recommending united states visas for european jews who were trying to flee persecution and lobbied for looser immigration rules he raised money for zionist organizations and was in part responsible for the 1933 formation of the international rescue committee
in germany deutsche physik activists published pamphlets and even textbooks denigrating einstein nobel laureates philipp lenard and johannes stark led a campaign to eliminate einsteins work from the german lexicon as unacceptable jewish physics jüdische physik instructors who taught his theories were blacklisted including nobel laureate werner heisenberg who had debated quantum probability with bohr and einstein philipp lenard claimed that the mass–energy equivalence formula needed to be credited to friedrich hasenöhrl to make it an aryan creation a man convicted of inciting others to kill einstein was fined a mere six dollars
after world war ii ended and the nazis were removed from power einstein refused to associate with germany einstein refused several honors bestowed upon him by germany as he could not forgive the germans for the holocaust where six million of his fellow jews were killed einstein however re-visited germany on a trip to europe in 1952


 zionism 
einstein was a prominent supporter of both labor zionism and supported efforts to encourage jewish-arab cooperation he supported the creation of a jewish national homeland in the british mandate of palestine but was opposed to the idea of a jewish state with borders an army and a measure of temporal power according to marc elis einstein declared himself a human being a jew an opponent of nationalism and as a zionist he supported the idea of a jewish homeland in palestine but until summer 1947 conceived of this as a bi-national state with continuously functioning mixed administrative economic and social organizations

his speeches and lectures about zionism were published in 1931 by the macmillan company and eleven of these essays were collected in a 1933 book entitled mein weltbild and translated into english as the world as i see it einsteins foreword dedicates the collection to the jews of germany in the face of germanys rising militarism einstein wrote and spoke for peace
einstein publicly stated reservations about the proposal to partition the british mandate of palestine into independent arab and jewish countries in a 1938 speech our debt to zionism he said i should much rather see reasonable agreement with the arabs on the basis of living together in peace than the creation of a jewish state my awareness of the essential nature of judaism resists the idea of a jewish state with borders an army and a measure of temporal power no matter how modest i am afraid of the inner damage judaism will sustain—especially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own ranks against which we have already had to fight strongly even without a jewish state  if external necessity should after all compel us to assume this burden let us bear it with tact and patience his attitudes were nuanced in his testimony before the anglo-american committee of inquiry in january 1946 he stated that he was not in favour of the creation of a jewish state while in a 1947 letter to indian prime minister jawaharlal nehru intended to persuade india to support the establishment of a jewish state einstein stated that the balfour declarations proposal to establish a national home for jews in palestine redresses the balance of justice and history claiming that at the end of the first world war the allies gave the arabs 99% of the vast underpopulated territories liberated from the turks to satisfy their national aspirations and five independent arab states were established one per cent was reserved for the jews in the land of their origin einstein remained strongly supportive of unlimited jewish immigration to palestine
the united nations ultimately recommended division the mandate and the establishment of a jewish state and the 1948 arab-israeli war broke out as the mandate ended einstein was one of the authors of an open letter to the new york times in 1948 deeply criticizing menachem begins herut freedom party for the deir yassin massacre einstein et al 1948 likening it to the nazi and fascist parties and stated the deir yassin incident exemplifies the character and actions of the freedom party this letter has led some to believe einstein to be anti-zionist although einsteins motivation was a concern for the future of israel if the freedom party continued to gain power when president harry truman recognized israel in may 1948 einstein declared it the fulfillment of our jewish dreams einstein also supported vice president henry wallace’s progressive party during the 1948 presidential election which also advocated a pro-soviet and pro-israel foreign policy
einstein served on the board of governors of the hebrew university of jerusalem in his will of 1950 einstein bequeathed literary rights to his writings to the hebrew university where many of his original documents are held in the albert einstein archives
when president chaim weizmann died in 1952 einstein was asked to be israels second president but he declined stating that he had neither the natural ability nor the experience to deal with human beings he wrote i am deeply moved by the offer from our state of israel and at once saddened and ashamed that i cannot accept it


 civil rights 
einstein was a proponent of civil rights when he arrived in america he objected to the mistreatment of african americans einstein who had experienced heavy anti-semitic discrimination in pre-world war ii germany worked with a number of leading civil rights activists and civil rights organizations such as the princeton chapter of the naacp to demand equality and denounce racism and segregation wherever he saw injustice einstein spoke out when african-american singer and civil rights supporter marian anderson was denied rooms at hotels and forbidden to eat at public restaurants einstein invited her to his home after a bloody racial riot in 1946 in which 500 state troopers with submachine guns attacked and destroyed virtually every black-owned business in a four-square-block area in tennessee and arrested 25 black men for attempted murder einstein joined eleanor roosevelt langston hughes and thurgood marshall to fight for justice for the men later 24 of the 25 defendants were acquitted

in 1946 the nobel prize-winning physicist traveled to lincoln university in pennsylvania the alma mater of langston hughes and thurgood marshall and the first school in america to grant college degrees to blacks at lincoln einstein received an honorary degree and gave a lecture on relativity to lincoln students
also when two black couples were murdered in monroe georgia and justice was not served einstein was so outraged he lent his prominence to actor and activist paul robeson’s american crusade to end lynching and wrote a letter to president truman calling for prosecution of lynchers and passage of a federal anti-lynching law he became good friends with robeson and when robeson was blacklisted because of his activism against racism again it was einstein who opened his home to his long-time friend of 20 years
from the scottsboro boys case to the numerous attempts to stop the execution of willie mcgee a black mississippi sharecropper accused of raping a white woman and efforts to prevent new jersey from extraditing sam buckhannon a black georgian who had escaped a chain gang after serving 18 years for stealing a pack of cigarettes einstein used his fame to condemn american racism


 gay rights 
einstein was one of the thousands of signatories of magnus hirschfelds petition against paragraph 175 of the german penal code which condemned homosexuality the petition ran for more than thirty years in the intellectual circles thanks to the activity of hirschfelds wissenschaftlich-humanitäres komitee scientific-humanitarian committee which collected many signatures from the jewish intellectual elite


 atomic bomb 

concerned scientists many of them refugees in the us from german anti-semitism recognized the danger of german scientists developing an atomic bomb based on the newly discovered phenomena of nuclear fission in 1939 the hungarian émigré leó szilárd having failed to arouse us government interest on his own worked with einstein to write a letter to us president franklin delano roosevelt which einstein signed urging us development of such a weapon on 11 october 1939 alexander sachs an adviser to roosevelt on economic affairs delivered the einstein–szilárd letter and persuaded the president of its importance this requires action roosevelt told an aide and authorized secret research into the harnessing of nuclear fission for military purposes
by 1942 this effort had become the manhattan project the largest secret scientific endeavor undertaken up to that time by late 1945 the us with support from the united kingdom and canada had developed operational nuclear weapons and used them on the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki einstein himself did not play a role in the development of the atomic bomb other than signing the letter although he did help the united states navy with some unrelated theoretical questions it was working on during the war
according to linus pauling einstein later expressed regret about his letter to roosevelt adding that einstein had originally justified his decision because of the greater danger that nazi germany would develop the bomb first in 1947 einstein told newsweek magazine that had i known that the germans would not succeed in developing an atomic bomb i would have done nothing in that same year he wrote an article for the atlantic monthly arguing that the united states should not try to pursue an atomic monopoly and instead should equip the united nations with nuclear weapons for the sole purpose of maintaining deterrence


 cold war politics 

when he was a visible figure working against the rise of nazism einstein had sought help and developed working relationships in both the west and what was to become the soviet bloc after world war ii enmity between the former allies became a very serious issue for people with international résumés to make things worse during the first days of mccarthyism einstein was writing about a single world government it was at this time that he wrote i do not know how the third world war will be fought but i can tell you what they will use in the fourth — sticks and stones in a 1949 monthly review article entitled why socialism albert einstein described a chaotic capitalist society a source of evil to be overcome as the predatory phase of human development einstein 1949 with albert schweitzer and bertrand russell einstein lobbied to stop nuclear testing and future bombs days before his death einstein signed the russell-einstein manifesto which led to the pugwash conferences on science and world affairs
einstein was a member of several civil rights groups including the princeton chapter of the naacp when the aged w e b du bois was accused of being a communist spy einstein volunteered as a character witness and the case was dismissed shortly afterward einsteins friendship with activist paul robeson with whom he served as co-chair of the american crusade to end lynching lasted twenty years
in 1946 einstein collaborated with rabbi israel goldstein middlesex university heir c ruggles smith and activist attorney george alpert on the albert einstein foundation for higher learning which was formed to create a jewish-sponsored secular university open to all students on the grounds of the former middlesex university in waltham massachusetts middlesex was chosen in part because it was accessible from both boston and new york city jewish cultural centers of the us their vision was a university deeply conscious both of the hebraic tradition of torah looking upon culture as a birthright and of the american ideal of an educated democracy the collaboration was stormy however finally when einstein wanted to appoint british economist harold laski as the universitys president george alpert wrote that laski was a man utterly alien to american principles of democracy tarred with the communist brush einstein withdrew his support and barred the use of his name the university opened in 1948 as brandeis university in 1953 brandeis offered einstein an honorary degree but he declined


 socialism 
einstein was in favour of socialism and in opposition to capitalism as illustrated by the following quote

einstein thought highly of vladimir lenin saying i honor lenin as a man who completely sacrificed himself and devoted all his energy to the realization of social justice i do not consider his methods practical but one thing is certain men of his type are the guardians and restorers of humanity

einstein held a form of socialism called georgism named after the political economist henry george in high regard writing one cannot imagine a more beautiful combination of intellectual keenness artistic form and fervent love of justice
given einsteins links to germany and zionism his socialist ideals and his links to communist figures the us federal bureau of investigation kept a file on einstein that grew to 1,427 pages
einstein considered joseph mccarthy a us senator involved in the anti-communist red scare a danger to intellectual freedom william frauenglass a new york city school teacher who having been called to testify refused and facing dismissal from his position wrote to einstein for support in his reply einstein stated the reactionary politicians have managed to instill suspicion of all intellectual efforts into the public by dangling before their eyes a danger from without having succeeded so far they are now proceeding to suppress the freedom of teaching and to deprive of their positions all those who do not prove submissive ie to starve them his advice every intellectual who is called before one of the committees ought to refuse to testify ie he must be prepared for jail and economic ruin in short for the sacrifice of his personal welfare in the interest of the cultural welfare of his country
concluding einstein said if enough people are ready to take this grave step they will be successful if not then the intellectuals of this country deserve nothing better than the slavery which is intended for them


 war 

einstein was a lifelong pacifist and believed that wars stood in the way of human progress he believed that wars were the result of natural aggressive tendencies found within all organisms and that the aims and causes of war were simply justification for these tendencies he advocated the creation of a supranational organization would make war as impossible in europe as it was impossible between the former kingdoms that comprised the german empire einstein was horrified by the destruction caused by world war i and promoted what he referred to as the two percent plan according to the plan nations would be unable to wage war if one in 50 men refused to serve in the military
despite these views following the rise to power of adolf hitler einstein became a vocal advocate for preparedness recognizing the dangers of nazi germany gaining an advantage over the western allies alarmed at hitler’s territorial ambitions einstein actively encouraged belgians to join the military to protect european civilization he explained the change in his outlook in 1941

in the twenties when no dictatorships existed i advocated that refusing to go to war would make war improper but as soon as coercive conditions appeared in certain nations i felt that it would weaken the less aggressive nations vis-à-vis the more aggressive ones

einstein justified his letter to president roosevelt recommending that an atomic bomb be produced by writing

it seemed probable that the germans might be working on the same problem with every prospect of success i had no alternative but to act as i did although i have always been a convinced pacifist emphasis in original

when questioned about this position einstein wrote

i did not say that i was an absolute pacifist but rather that i has always been a convinced pacifist while i am a convinced pacifist there are circumstances in which i believe the use of force is appropriate – namely in the face of an enemy unconditionally bent on destroying me and my people  i am a dedicated but not an absolute pacifist this means that i am opposed to the use of force under any circumstances except when confronted by an enemy who pursues the destruction of life as an end in itself emphasis in original

he further explained

i have always been a pacifist ie i have declined to recognize brute force as a means for the solution of international conflicts nevertheless it is in my opinion not reasonable to cling to that principle unconditionally an exception has necessarily to be made if a hostile power threatens wholesale destruction of ones own group

following the conclusion of world war ii einstein once again became a constant and vocal activist for world peace
