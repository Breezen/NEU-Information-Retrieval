solar physics is the branch of astrophysics that specializes in the study of the sun it deals with detailed measurements that are possible only for our closest star it intersects with many disciplines of pure physics astrophysics and computer science including fluid dynamics plasma physics including magnetohydrodynamics seismology particle physics atomic physics nuclear physics stellar evolution space physics spectroscopy radiative transfer applied optics signal processing computer vision computational physics stellar physics and solar astronomy
because the sun is uniquely situated for close-range observing other stars cannot be resolved with anything like the spatial or temporal resolution that the sun can there is a split between the related discipline of observational astrophysics of distant stars and observational solar physics
the study of solar physics is also important as it is believed that changes in the solar atmosphere and solar activity can have a major impact on earths climate the sun also provides a physical laboratory for the study of plasma physics


 history 


 ancient times 
babylonians were keeping a record of solar eclipses with the oldest record originating from the ancient city of ugarit in modern-day syria this record dates to about 1300 bc ancient chinese astronomers were also observing solar phenomena such as solar eclipses and visible sunspots with the purpose of keeping track of calendars which were based on lunar and solar cycles unfortunately records kept before 720 bc are very vague and offer no useful information however after 720 bc 37 solar eclipses were noted over the course of 240 years


 medieval times 
astronomical knowledge flourished in the islamic world during medieval times many observatories were built in cities from damascus to baghdad where detailed astronomical observations were taken particularly a few solar parameters were measured and detailed observations of the sun were taken solar observations were taken with the purpose of navigation but mostly for timekeeping islam requires its followers to pray five times a day at specific position of the sun in the sky as such accurate observations of the sun and its trajectory on the sky were needed in the late 10th century iranian astronomer abu-mahmud khojandi built a massive observatory near tehran there he took accurate measurements of a series of meridian transits of the sun which he later used to calculate the obliquity of the ecliptic following the fall of the western roman empire western europe was cut from all sources of ancient scientific knowledge especially those written in greek this plus de-urbanisation and diseases such as the black death led to a decline in scientific knowledge in medieval europe especially in the early middle ages during this period observations of the sun were taken either in relation to the zodiac or to assist in building places of worship such as churches and cathedrals


 renaissance period 
in astronomy the renaissance period started with the work of nicolaus copernicus he proposed that planets revolve around the sun and not around the earth as it was believed at the time this model is known as the heliocentric model his work was later expanded by johannes kepler and galileo galilei particularly galilei used his new telescope to look at the sun in 1610 he discovered sunspots on its surface in the autumn of 1611 johannes fabricius wrote the first book on sunspots de maculis in sole observatis on the spots observed in the sun


 modern times 
modern day solar physics is focused towards understanding the many phenomena observed with the help of modern telescopes and satellites of particular interest are the structure of the solar photosphere the coronal heat problem and sunspots


 research 
the solar physics division of the american astronomical society boasts 555 members as of may 2007 compared to several thousand in the parent organization
a major thrust of current 2009 effort in the field of solar physics is integrated understanding of the entire solar system including the sun and its effects throughout interplanetary space within the heliosphere and on planets and planetary atmospheres studies of phenomena that affect multiple systems in the heliosphere or that are considered to fit within a heliospheric context are called heliophysics a new coinage that entered usage in the early years of the current millennium


 space based 


 sdo 

the solar dynamics observatory sdo was launched by nasa in february 2010 from cape canaveral the main goals of the mission are understanding how solar activity arises and how it affects life on earth by determining how the suns magnetic field is generated and structured and how the stored magnetic energy is converted and released into space


 soho 

the solar  heliospheric observatory soho is a joint project between nasa and esa that was launched in december 1995 it was launched to probe the interior of the sun make observations of the solar wind and phenomena associated with it and investigate the outer layers of the sun


 hinode 

a publicly funded mission led by the japanese aerospace exploration agency the hinode satellite launched in 2006 consists of a coordinated set of optical extreme ultraviolet and x-ray instruments these investigate the interaction between the solar corona and the suns magnetic field


 ground based 


 atst 

the advanced technology solar telescope atst is a solar telescope facility that is under construction in maui twenty-two institutions are collaborating on the atst project with the main funding agency being the national science foundation


 big bear 

the big bear solar observatory in california houses several telescopes including the new solar telescopents which is a 1.6 meter clear-aperture off-axis gregorian telescope the nts saw first light in december 2008 until the atst comes on line the nts remains the largest solar telescope in the world the big bear observatory is one of several facilities operated by the center for solar-terrestrial research at new jersey institute of technology njit


 other 


 eunis 
the extreme ultraviolet normal incidence spectrograph eunisis a two channel imaging spectrograph that first flew in 2006 it observes the solar corona with high spectral resolution so far it has provided information on the nature of coronal bright points cool transients and coronal loop arcades data from it also helped calibrating soho and a few other telescopes
