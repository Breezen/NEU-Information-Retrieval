an omen also called portent or presage is a phenomenon that is believed to foretell the future often signifying the advent of change people in ancient times believed that omens bring a divine message from their gods
these omens include natural phenomena for example an eclipse abnormal births of animals and humans and behavior of the sacrificial lamb on its way to the slaughter they had specialists the diviners to interpret these omens they would also use an artificial method for example a clay model of a sheep liver to communicate with their gods in times of crisis they would expect a binary answer either yes or no answer favorable or unfavorable they did these to predict what would happen in the future and to take action to avoid disaster
though the word omen is usually devoid of reference to the changes nature hence being possibly either good or bad the term is more often used in a foreboding sense as with the word ominous the origin of the word is unknown although it may be connected with the latin word audire meaning to hear


 ancient near east 
the oldest source for this practice in the ancient near west came from mesopos practice attested at the first half of the 2nd millennium bc and it was vigorously pursued by the asian kings esarhaddon and his son ashurbanipal in the 20th century bc
there were 3 methods to interpret omens and they were hepatoscopy ie liver divination lecanomancy and libanomancy hepatoscopy is to observe irregularities and abnormalities on the appearance of the entrails of a sacrificial sheep and they were used most in royal services
astrological omens were popular in assyria during the 7th century bc diviners gained much influence by interpreting the omens and advising the king how to avoid the terrible fate during the reign of esarhaddon 681-669 bc one of the things they would do in assyria was to put a substitute king on the throne and the true king would hide for a while the substitute king was expected to take the evil consequences and when they believed the danger is over they would execute the substitute king and the true king will be back on the throne
the observations of omens were recorded into series some of them dated back to the first half of the 2nd millennium bc and these were arranged as conditional statement later if such and such is the case then such and such is the result
this belief of omens later spread out around the near east and beyond when clay models of sheep livers use for the diviners to learn the craft were found in boghazkoi ugarit megiddo and hazor
such practice was found in israel as well compared to israel they used the methods listed above except hepatoscopy according to the bible god did not answer king saul through dreams or urim and thummim or prophets before his final confrontation with the philistines thus showed that they have a similar belief and practice with their prophets and dreams and similar tool as urim and thummim
letters from the city mari dated at the latest from the 18th century showed that this divinatory practices were not limited to royal court but also played an important role in everyday life of the people


 ancient greece 
an oionosomen was defined in antiquity as the carnivorous vulture especially a prophetic bird by careful observation of the bird’s cries and the way or direction it flew the augurs attempted to predict the future they also saw lightning or thunder as omens sent from zeus and observed the direction in which they saw or heard them omens represented the divine will and the decisions of the gods their positioning opposite human endeavors and were aimed at being understood by sensitive receivers of the time who brought the divine charisma to become intermediaries channels between the world of gods and humans even since homeric times the greeks paid special attention to these signs when they saw vultures from the left another symbol of zeus they considered it a bad omen the cry of a heron or a lightning to the right marked positive and promising omen in the greek territory seers also judged good and bad omens from the unwillingness or willingness of a victim to approach the altar and by the state of its offal when slaughtered


 ancient rome 

in ancient roman religion augurs interpreted the flights of birds to ascertain the will of the gods in response to specific questions their system was complex for example while a bird-sign on the left was usually favourable auspicious and one on the right unfavourable inauspicious the combination of a raven on the right and a crow on the left was favourable augurs also studied the behaviour of domesticated sacred chickens before embarking on important enterprises such as a senatorial meeting the passage of a new law or a battle these formal divine consultations by augurs are known as taking the auspices haruspices examined the liver lungs and entrails of animals sacrifice to interpret the will of the gods again in response to clear and specific proposals some omens came in the form of prodigies - unnatural aberrant or unusual phenomena such as meteor showers hermaphrodite births or blood rain any of which could signify that the gods had somehow been angered the meaning and import of reported prodigies were officially debated and decided by the roman senate with advice from religious experts threatening signs could then be officially expiated and the gods placated with the appropriate sacrifice and rituals the interpretation and expiation of omens that suggested a threat to the state was a serious business in 217 bc the consul gaius flaminius disregarded his horses collapse the chickens and yet other omens before his disaster at lake trasimene certain natural events particularly lightning strikes and thunder could be ominous for the public or state or only for the individual who saw or heard them when a thunderclap interrupted his election as consul marcellus gave up his candidacy therafter he travelled in an enclosed litter when on important business to avoid sight of any bad omens that might affect his plans
many romans believed that particular words phrases or incidents might carry prophetic content aimed at particular individuals who witnessed or heard them such private omens could be accepted and their benefits secured or their threat averted by use of countersigns or verbal formulas such as accepit omen arripuit omen i accept the omen i hold to it the consul l aemilius paullus when about to embark on his campaign against king perseus heard his daughter say that her dog persa had died given the similarity of the names and the death of the dog he took this as a sign that pereus would be defeated - which he was the orator and statesman cicero though an augur himself and apparently convinced that in capable hands it offered a reliable means of foretelling the future was skeptical of unsolicited personal omens he reports the story that licinius crassus took ship for syria despite the ominous call of a fig-seller – cauneas caunean figs which might be heard as cave ne eas beware dont go - and was killed on campaign cicero saw these events as merely coincidental only the credulous could think them ominous


 astrology 

in the field of astrology solar and lunar eclipses along with the appearance of comets and to some extent the full moon have often been considered omens of notable births deaths or other significant events throughout history in many societies one biblical example is the magi in the gospel of matthew who predicted the birth of jesus after seeing the star of bethlehem


 good or bad 
omens may be considered either good or bad depending on their interpretation the same sign may be interpreted differently by different people or different cultures
for example a superstition in the united states and other countries across europe indicates that a black cat is an omen of bad luck
comets also have been considered to be both good and bad omens one example of this is halleys comet which was a bad omen for king harold ii of england but a good omen for william the conqueror
