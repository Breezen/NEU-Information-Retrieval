the apollo 17 wooden plaque displays with the so-called goodwill moon rocks were presented to all the states of the united states and all the countries of the world on march 21 1973 president nixon sent a letter on that date that accompanied the lunar sample displays to all the worldwide countries and all the states of the united states and its possessions national archives in washington dc has a copy of this letter

the apollo lunar landing program conducted by the united states has been brought to a successful conclusion men from the planet earth have reached the first milestone in space but as we stretch for the stars we know that we stand also upon the shoulders of many men of many nations here on our own planet in the deepest sense our exploration of the moon was truly an international effort
it is for this reason that on behalf of the people of the united states i present this flag which was carried to the moon to the state and its fragment of the moon obtained during the final lunar mission of the apollo program
if people of many nations can act together to achieve the dreams of humanity in space then surely we can act together to accomplish humanitys dream of peace here on earth it was in this spirit that the united states of america went to the moon and it is in this spirit that we look forward to sharing what we have done and what we have learned with all mankind
