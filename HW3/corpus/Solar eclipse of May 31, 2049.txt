 solar eclipses 2047-2050 
each member in a semester series of solar eclipses repeats approximately every 177 days and 4 hours a semester at alternating nodes of the moons orbit
note partial lunar eclipses on january 26 2047 and july 22 2047 occur on the previous lunar year eclipse set


 inex series 
this eclipse is a part of the long period inex cycle repeating at alternating nodes every 358 synodic months ≈ 10,571.95 days or 29 years minus 20 days their appearance and longitude are irregular due to a lack of synchronization with the anomalistic month period of perigee however groupings of 3 inex cycles ≈ 87 years minus 2 months comes close ≈ 1,151.02 anomalistic months so eclipses are similar in these groupings


 metonic series 
the metonic series repeats eclipses every 19 years 6939.69 days lasting about 5 cycles eclipses occur in nearly the same calendar date in addition the octon subseries repeats 1/5 of that or every 3.8 years 1387.94 days
