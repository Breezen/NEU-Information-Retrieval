alfonso xiii spanish alfonso león fernando maría jaime isidro pascual antonio de borbón y habsburgo-lorena 17 may 1886 – 28 february 1941 was king of spain from 1886 until the proclamation of the second republic in 1931 alfonso was monarch from birth as his father alfonso xii had died the previous year alfonsos mother maria christina of austria served as regent until he assumed full powers on his sixteenth birthday in 1902
during alfonsos reign spain experienced four major problems that contributed to the end of the liberal monarchy the lack of real political representation of broad social groups the poor situation of the popular classes especially peasants problems arising from the rif war and catalan nationalism this political and social turbulence that began with the spanish–american war prevented the turnaround parties from establishing a true liberal democracy which led to the establishment of the dictatorship of primo de rivera with the political failure of the dictatorship alfonso impelled a return to the democratic normality with the intention of regenerating the regime nevertheless it was abandoned by all political classes as they felt betrayed by the kings support of the dictatorship of primo de rivera
he left spain voluntarily after the municipal elections of april 1931 that was taken as a plebiscite between monarchy or republic in exile he retained his claim to the defunct throne until 1941 when he renounced his claim in favour of his third son juan whose eldest son juan carlos did eventually become king when the monarchy was restored and died six weeks later buried in rome his remains were not transferred until 1980 to the pantheon of the kings in the monastery of el escorial


 reign 


 birth and regency 

alfonso was born in madrid on 17 may 1886 he was the posthumous son of alfonso xii of spain who had died in november 1885 and became king of spain upon his birth just after he was born he was carried naked to the spanish prime minister on a silver tray five days later he was carried in a solemn court procession with a golden fleece round his neck and was baptized with water specially brought from the river jordan in palestine the french newspaper le figaro described the young king in 1889 as the happiest and best-loved of all the rulers of the earth his mother maria christina of austria served as his regent until his 16th birthday during the regency in 1898 spain lost its colonial rule over cuba puerto rico guam and the philippines to the united states as a result of the spanish–american war
when he came of age in may 1902 the week of his majority was marked by festivities bullfights balls and receptions throughout spain he took his oath to the constitution before members of the cortes on 17 may


 engagement and marriage 

by 1905 alfonso was looking for a suitable consort on a state visit to the united kingdom he stayed at buckingham palace with king edward vii there he met princess victoria eugenie of battenberg the scottish-born daughter of edwards youngest sister princess beatrice and a granddaughter of queen victoria he found her attractive and she returned his interest there were obstacles to the marriage victoria was a protestant and would have to become a catholic victorias brother leopold was a haemophiliac so there was a 50 percent chance that victoria was a carrier of the trait finally alfonsos mother maria christina wanted him to marry a member of her family the house of habsburg-lorraine or some other catholic princess as she considered the battenbergs to be non-dynastic
victoria was willing to change her religion and her being a haemophilia carrier was only a possibility maria christina was eventually persuaded to drop her opposition in january 1906 she wrote an official letter to princess beatrice proposing the match victoria met maria christina and alfonso in biarritz france later that month and converted to catholicism in san sebastián in march

in may diplomats of both kingdoms officially executed the agreement of marriage alfonso and victoria were married at the royal monastery of san jerónimo in madrid on 31 may 1906 with british royalty in attendance including victorias cousins the prince and princess of wales later king george v and queen mary the wedding was marked by an assassination attempt on alfonso and victoria by catalan anarchist mateu morral as the wedding procession returned to the palace he threw a bomb from a window which killed or injured several bystanders and members of the procession
on 10 may 1907 the couples first child alfonso prince of asturias was born however victoria was in fact a haemophilia carrier and alfonso inherited the condition
neither of the two daughters born to the king and queen were haemophilia carriers but another of their sons gonzalo 1914–1934 had the condition alfonso distanced himself from his queen for transmitting the condition to their sons
from 1914 on he had several mistresses and fathered five illegitimate children a sixth illegitimate child had been born before his marriage


 world war i 
during world war i because of his family connections with both sides and the division of popular opinion spain remained neutral the king established an office for assistance to prisoners of war on all sides this office used the spanish diplomatic and military network abroad to intercede for thousands of pows – transmitting and receiving letters for them and other services the office was located in the royal palace
alfonso became gravely ill during the 1918 flu pandemic spain was neutral and thus under no wartime censorship restrictions so his illness and subsequent recovery were reported to the world while flu outbreaks in the belligerent countries were concealed this gave the misleading impression that spain was the most-affected area and led to the pandemic being dubbed the spanish flu


 rif war and the marqués de estella 

following world war i spain entered the lengthy yet victorious rif war 1920–1926 to preserve its colonial rule over northern morocco critics of the monarchy thought the war was an unforgivable loss of money and lives and nicknamed alfonso el africano the african alfonso had not acted as a strict constitutional monarch and supported the africanists who wanted to conquer for spain a new empire in africa to compensate for the lost empire in the americas and asia the rif war had starkly polarized spanish society between the africanists who wanted to conquer an empire in africa vs the abandonistas who wanted to abandon morocco as not worth the blood and treasure alfonso liked to play favourites with his generals and one of his most favored generals was manuel fernández silvestre in 1921 when silvestre advanced up into the rif mountains of morocco alfonso sent him a telegram whose first line read hurrah for real men urging silvestre not to retreat at a time when silvestre was experiencing major difficulties silvestre stayed the course leading his men into the battle of annual one of spains worst defeats alfonso who was on holiday in the south of france at the time was informed of the disaster of the annual while he was playing golf reportedly alfonsos response to the news was to shrug his shoulders and say chicken meat is cheap before resuming his game of golf alfonso remained in france and did not return to spain to comfort the families of the soldiers lost at the disaster of the annual which many people at the time saw as a callous and cold act a sign that the king couldnt care less about the lives of his soldiers in 1922 the cortes started an investigation into the responsibility for the annual disaster and soon discovered evidence that the king had been one of the main supporters of silvestres advance into the rif mountains
after the disaster of the annual spains war in the rif went from bad to worse and as the spanish were barely hanging onto morocco support for the abandonistas grew as many people could see no point to the war in august 1923 spanish soldiers embarking for morocco mutinied other soldiers in malaga simply refused to board the ships that were to take them to morocco while in barcelona huge crowds of left-wingers had staged anti-war protests at which spanish flags were burned while the flag of the rif republic was waved about with the africanists comprising only a minority it was clear that it was only a matter of time before the abandonistas forced the spanish to give up on the rif which was part of the reason for the military coup détat later in 1923 on september 13 1923 general miguel primo de rivera 2nd marqués de estella seized power in a military coup he ruled as a dictator with alfonsos support until 1930 it is believed that one of alfonsos main reasons for supporting the coup was his desire to suppress the publication of the damning cortes report into the annual disaster the poetic generation of 27 and catalan and basque nationalism grew in this era


 downfall and second republic 

in january 1930 due to economic problems and general unpopularity the 2nd marqués de estella resigned as prime minister alfonso as the marquéss ally shared the popular dislike the king had so closely associated with the primo de rivera dictatorship that it was difficult for him to distance himself from the regime he had supported for almost 7 years in april 1931 general le marqués del rif told him even the army was not loyal on 12 april the republican parties won a landslide victory in municipal elections the municipal elections were fought as a virtual referendum on the future of the monarchy on 14 april he fled the country as the second spanish republic was proclaimed but did not formally abdicate he settled eventually in rome
by a law of 26 november 1931 alfonso was accused by the cortes of high treason this law would later be repealed by a new law dated 15 december 1938 signed by francisco franco


 exile 
in 1933 his two eldest sons alfonso and jaime renounced their claims to the throne and in 1934 his youngest son gonzalo died this left his third son juan count of barcelona his only male heir juan later was the father of juan carlos i


 civil war 
when the army rose up against the democratically elected republican government war broke out alfonso made it clear he favoured the nationalist military rebels against the republic but in september 1936 the nationalist leader general francisco franco declared that the nationalists would not restore alfonso as king the nationalist army included many carlist supporters of a rival pretender
nevertheless he sent his son juan to spain in 1936 to participate in the uprising however general mola had juan arrested near the french border and expelled from the country
on 29 september 1936 upon the death of infante alfonso carlos duke of san jaime the carlist pretender alfonso also became the senior heir of hugh capet and so was hailed by some french legitimists as king alphonse i of france and navarre


 renunciation of claims to the throne and death 
on 15 january 1941 alfonso xiii abdicated his rights to the defunct spanish throne in favour of juan he died in rome on 28 february of that year
in spain the dictator franco ordered three days of national mourning his funeral was held in rome in the church of santa maria degli angeli e dei martiri alfonso was buried in the church of santa maria in monserrato degli spagnoli the spanish national church in rome immediately below the tombs of pope callixtus iii and pope alexander vi in january 1980 his remains were transferred to el escorial in spain
