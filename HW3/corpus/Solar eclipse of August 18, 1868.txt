a total solar eclipse occurred on august 18 1868 also known as the king of siams eclipse a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between earth and the sun thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the sun for a viewer on earth a total solar eclipse occurs when the moons apparent diameter is larger than the suns blocking all direct sunlight turning day into darkness totality occurs in a narrow path across earths surface with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide


 observations 

captain bullock observed from the celebes sea sketching the appearance of the corona while gustav fritsch accompanied an expedition to aden


 discovery of helium 
french astronomer pierre janssen observed the eclipse from guntur in madras state british india it was the first total eclipse since gustav kirchhoffs 1859 theory that the fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum correspond to the emission line of the different chemical elements present in the sun correspondingly janssen observed the eclipse with the aid of a spectroscope he noticed a bright yellow line λ  587.49 nm in the spectra of the solar prominences that could not be due to sodium as had previously been assumed and was subsequently able to observe the same line even without the need for an eclipse the same result was found independently by british astronomer norman lockyer and both janssens and lockyers communications were presented to the french academy of sciences on october 26 1868


 king mongkuts calculation 
king mongkut also known as rama iv of siam was able to calculate and predict the solar eclipse two years earlier the calculations were correct as to the place the time and the type of the solar eclipse that would happen the eclipse took place precisely as the king had predicted the total phase lasting six minutes and 46 seconds in fact his calculations were better — by about two seconds — than those of the french astronomers who acknowledged his accuracy mongkut was exposed to malaria then developed chills and fever he died on october 1 1868 according to the thai astronomical society and nasa this eclipse is known as the king of siams eclipse
