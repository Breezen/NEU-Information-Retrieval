an eclipse season is one of only two periods during a year when eclipses can occur due to the orbital inclination of the moon each season lasts for approximately 34 days and repeats just short of six months thus two full eclipse seasons always occur each year either two or three eclipses happen each eclipse season during the eclipse season the inclination of the moons orbit is low hence the sun moon and earth become aligned straight enough in syzygy for an eclipse to occur
during each season the type of solar eclipse whether total or annular as seen from the sublunar point depends on the apparent sizes of the sun and moon which is a function of the elliptical distance of earth from the sun and of the moon from earth respectively as seen from earths surface
if the earth had a perfectly circular orbit centered around the sun if the moons orbit was also perfectly circular and centered around the earth and if both orbits were coplanar on the same plane with each other then two eclipses would happen every lunar month 29.53 days a lunar eclipse would occur at every full moon a solar eclipse every new moon and all solar eclipses would be the same type


 details 
an eclipse season is the only time during which the sun from the perspective of the earth is close enough to one of the moons nodes to allow for an eclipse to occur during the season whenever there is a full moon a lunar eclipse will occur and whenever there is a new moon a solar eclipse will occur if the sun is close enough to a node then a total eclipse will occur each season lasts from 31 to 37 days recurring about every 6 months at least two one solar and one lunar in any order and at most three eclipses solar lunar then solar again or vice versa will occur during every eclipse season this is because it is about 15 days a fortnight between full moon and new moon and vice versa if there is an eclipse at the very beginning of the season then there is enough time 30 days for two more eclipses
in other words because the eclipse season 34 days long on average is longer than the synodic month one lunation or the time for the moon to return to a particular phase and about 29.5 days the moon will be new or full at least two and up to three times during the season eclipse seasons occur slightly shy of six months apart successively occurring every 173.31 days - half of an eclipse year the time it takes the sun to travel from one node to the next along the ecliptic if the last eclipse of an eclipse season occurs at the very beginning of a calendar year it is possible for a total of seven eclipses to occur since there is still time before the end of the calendar year for two full eclipse seasons each having up to three eclipses


 examples 


 visual sequence of two particular eclipse seasons 
in each sequence below each eclipse is separated by a fortnight the first and last eclipse in each sequence is separated by one synodic month see also eclipse cycles
the two eclipse seasons above share similarities lunar or solar centrality and gamma of each eclipse in the same column because they are a half saros apart
