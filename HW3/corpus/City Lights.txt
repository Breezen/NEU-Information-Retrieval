 production 


 pre-production 

chaplins feature the circus released in 1928 was his last film before the motion picture industry embraced sound recording and brought the silent movie era to a close as his own producer and distributor part owner of united artists chaplin could still conceive city lights as a silent film technically the film was a crossover as its soundtrack had synchronized music sound effects and some unintelligible sounds that copied speech pattern films the dialogue was presented on intertitles chaplin was first contacted by inventor eugene augustin lauste in 1918 about making a sound film but he never ended up meeting with lauste chaplin was dismissive about talkies and told a reporter that he would give the talkies three years thats all he was also concerned about how to adjust the little tramp to sound films
in early 1928 chaplin began writing the script with harry carr the plot gradually grew from an initial concept chaplin had considered after the success of the circus where a circus clown goes blind and has to conceal his handicap from his young daughter by pretending that his inability to see are pratfalls this inspired the blind girl the first scenes chaplin thought up were of the ending where the newly cured blind girl sees the little tramp for the first time a highly detailed description of the scene was written as chaplin considered it to be the center of the entire film
for a subplot chaplin first considered a character even lower on the social scale a black newsboy eventually he opted for a drunken millionaire a character previously used in the 1921 short the idle class the millionaire plot was based on an old idea chaplin had for a short in which two millionaires pick up the little tramp from the city dump and show him a good time in expensive clubs before dropping him back off at the dump so when he woke up the tramp would not know if it was real or a dream this was rewritten into a millionaire who is a friend of the tramp when drunk but does not recognize him when sober
chaplin officially began pre-production of the film in may 1928 and hired australian art director henry clive to design the sets that summer chaplin eventually cast clive in the role of the millionaire although the film was originally set in paris the art direction is inspired by a mix of several cities robert sherwood said that it is a weird city with confusing resemblances to london los angeles naples paris tangiers and council bluffs it is no city on earth and it is all cities
on august 28 1928 chaplins mother hannah chaplin died at the age of 63 chaplin was distraught for several weeks and pre-production did not resume until mid fall of 1928 psychologist stephen weissman has hypothesized that city lights is highly autobiographical with the blind girl representing chaplins mother while the drunken millionaire represents chaplins father weissman also compared many of the films sets with locations from chaplins real childhood such as the statue in the opening scene resembling st marks church on kennington park road and chaplin referring to the waterfront set as the thames embankment
chaplin had interviewed several actresses to play the blind flower girl but was unimpressed with them all while seeing a film shoot with bathing women in a santa monica beach he found a casual acquaintance virginia cherrill cherrill waved and asked if she would ever get the chance to work with him after a series of poor auditions from other actresses chaplin eventually invited her to do a screen test she was the first actress to subtly and convincingly act blind on camera due to her near-sightedness and cherrill signed a contract on november 1 1928


 principal photography 
filming for city lights officially began on december 27 1928 after chaplin and carr had worked on the script for almost an entire year as a filmmaker chaplin was known for being a perfectionist he was noted for doing many more takes than other directors at the time production began with the first scene at the flower stand where the little tramp first meets the blind flower girl the scene took weeks to shoot and chaplin first began to have second thoughts about casting cherrill years later cherrill said i never liked charlie and he never liked me in his autobiography chaplin took responsibility for his on-set tensions with cherrill blaming the stress of making the film for the conflict filming the scene continued until february 1929 and again for ten days in early april before chaplin put the scene aside to be filmed later he then shot the opening scene of the little tramp waking up in a newly unveiled public statue this scene involved up to 380 extras and was especially stressful for chaplin to shoot during this part of shooting construction was being done at chaplin studios because the city of los angeles had decided to widen la brea avenue and chaplin was forced to move several buildings away from the road
chaplin then shot the sequence where the little tramp first meets the millionaire and prevents him from committing suicide during filming henry clive suddenly decided that he did not want to jump into the tank of cold water in the scene causing chaplin to storm off the set and fire clive he was quickly replaced by harry myers who chaplin had known while under contract at keystone studios chaplin finished shooting the sequence on july 29 1929 with exteriors at pasadena bridge chaplin then shot a sequence that was eventually cut from the film involving the little tramp attempting to retrieve a stick that was stuck in a wall the scene included a young charles lederer chaplin later praised the scene but insisted that it needed to be cut he then continued filming the scenes with the millionaire until september 29 1929
in november chaplin began working with cherrill again in some of the flower girls less dramatic scenes while waiting for her scenes for several months cherrill had become bored and openly complained to chaplin during the filming of one scene cherrill asked chaplin if she could leave early so that she could go to a hair appointment chaplin fired virginia cherrill and replaced her with georgia hale chaplins co-star in the gold rush however hales screen tests proved that she was unsuitable for the role chaplin also briefly considered sixteen-year-old actress violet krauth but he was talked out of this idea by his collaborators chaplin finally re-hired cherrill to finish city lights she demanded and got a raise to 75 per week approximately seven minutes of test footage of hale survives and is included on the dvd release excerpts were first seen in the documentary unknown chaplin along with an unused opening sequence
chaplin then cast florence d lee as the blind girls grandmother and shot scenes with cherrill and lee for five weeks in late 1929 chaplin re-shot the first flower shop scene with cherrill this time the scene was completed in six days and chaplin was happy with cherrills performance chaplin had been shooting the film for a year and was only a little more than half way finished from march to april 1930 chaplin shot the scenes inside of the millionaires house at the town house on wilshire boulevard he hired joe van meter and albert austin whom he had known since his days working for fred karno as the burglars in the late spring of 1930 chaplin shot the last major comedy sequence the boxing match chaplin hired keystone actor hank mann to play the tramps opponent the scene required 100 extras and chaplin took four days to rehearse and six to shoot the scene and was shot between june 23 and 30 chaplin was initially nervous over the attendance for this scene so he invited his friends to be extras over 100 extras were present chaplin’s performance in the scene was so humorous that more people arrived daily to be an extra
in july and august chaplin finished up six weeks of smaller scenes including the two scenes of the tramp being harassed by newsboys one of whom was played by a young robert parrish
in september 1930 chaplin finished the shooting of the final scene which took six days chaplin said that he was happy with cherrills performance in the scene and that she had eventually understood the role when talking about his directing style on set chaplin stated that everything i do is a dance i think in terms of dance i think more so in city lights
from october to december 1930 chaplin edited the film and created the title cards when he completed the film silent films had become generally unpopular but city lights was one of the great financial and artistic successes of chaplins career and it was his personal favorite of his films especially fond of the final scene he said in city lights just the last scene  i’m not acting  almost apologetic standing outside myself and looking  it’s a beautiful scene beautiful and because it isn’t over-acted
the amount of film used for the picture was uncharacteristic for the time and was a sign of the long production process chaplin shot 314,256 feet of film and the completed film ran 8,093 feet this made a shooting ratio of almost 39 feet of film for each foot of film that made it in the final version


 music 
city lights marked the first time chaplin composed the film score to one of his productions while chaplin preferred his films to have live sound by the 1930s most theaters had gotten rid of their orchestras many of his critics claimed he was doing it to grab more credit chaplin whose parents and many members of the chaplin family were both musicians was struggling with the professional musicians he hired and took it upon himself to compose the score it was written in six weeks with arthur johnston and included over one hundred musical cues chaplin told a reporter that i really didnt write it down i la-laed and arthur johnson wrote it down and i wish you would give him credit because he did a very good job it is all simple music you know in keeping with my character the intention was to have a score that would translate the characters emotions through its melodies the score was recorded in five days with musical arranger alfred newman
the main theme used as a leitmotif for the blind flower girl is the song la violetera who’ll buy my violets from spanish composer josé padilla chaplin was unable to secure the original song performer raquel meller in the lead role but used her song anyway as a major theme chaplin lost a lawsuit to padilla which took place in paris where padilla lived for not crediting him some modern editions released for video include a new recording by carl davis


 release reception and legacy 

two weeks prior to the premiere chaplin decided to have an unpublicized preview at los angeles tower theatre it went poorly attracting a small and unenthusiastic crowd better results were seen at the gala premiere on january 30 1931 at the los angeles theater albert einstein and his wife were the guests of honor and the film received a standing ovation it next premiered at the george m cohan theater in new york where chaplin closely supervised the release spending the day doing interviews and previously spending 60,000 on the advertising as he was frustrated with what uas publicists had come up with chaplin demanded half of the total gross and considering audiences would be more attracted by the film itself than its technology he demanded higher ticket prices compared to talkies
chaplin was nervous about the films reception because silent films were becoming obsolete by then and the preview had undermined his confidence nevertheless city lights became one of chaplins most financially successful and critically acclaimed works following the good reception by american audiences with earnings of 2 million a quarter of which came from its 12-week run at the cohan chaplin went on a sixteen-date world tour between february and march 1932 starting with a premiere at londons dominion theatre on february 27 the film was enthusiastically received by depression-era audiences earning 5 million during its initial release
reviews were mostly positive a film critic for the los angeles examiner said that not since i reviewed the first chaplin comedies way back in the two-reel days has charlie given us such an orgy of laughs the new york times reviewer mordaunt hall considered it a film worked out with admirable artistry variety declared it was not chaplins best picture but that certain sequences were hilarious the new yorker wrote that it was on the order of his other films perhaps a little better than any of them and that it gave an impression not often - oh very seldom - found in the movies an indefinable impression perhaps best described as a quality of charm on the other hand alexander bakshy of the nation was highly critical of city lights objecting to the silent format and over-sentimentality and describing it as chaplins feeblest
the popularity of city lights endured with the films re-release in 1950 again positively received by audiences and critics in 1949 the critic james agee wrote in life magazine that the final scene was the greatest single piece of acting ever committed to celluloid richard meryman called the final scene one of the greatest moments in film history charles silver curator of film at the museum of modern art stated that the film is so highly regarded because it brought forth a new level of lyrical romanticism that had not appeared in chaplins earlier works he adds that like all romanticism it is based in the denial of the real world around it when the film premiered chaplin was much older he was in the midst of another round of legal battles with former spouse lita grey and the economic and political climate of the world had changed chaplin uses the girls blindness to remind the tramp of the precarious nature of romanticism in the real world as she unknowingly assaults him multiple times filmcom critic eric d snider said that by 1931 most hollywood filmmakers either embraced talking pictures resigned themselves to their inevitability or just gave up making movies yet chaplin held firm with his vision in this project he also noted that few in hollywood had the clout to make a silent film at that late date let alone do it well one reason was that chaplin knew the tramp could not be adapted to talking movies and still work
several well-known directors have praised city lights orson welles said it was his favorite film in a 1963 interview in the american magazine cinema stanley kubrick rated city lights as fifth among his top ten films in 1972 the renowned russian director andrei tarkovsky placed city lights as fifth among his top ten and said of chaplin he is the only person to have gone down into cinematic history without any shadow of a doubt the films he left behind can never grow old george bernard shaw called chaplin the only genius to come out of the movie industry celebrated italian director federico fellini often praised this film and his nights of cabiria refers to it in the 2003 documentary charlie the life and art of charles chaplin woody allen said it was chaplins best picture allen is said to have based the final scene of his 1979 film manhattan on its final scene chaplin biographer jeffrey vance has summarized all the best criticism and all the notable filmmakers who have singled out city lights as their favorite chaplin film throughout the decades in the criterion collection audio commentary track for the film vance has written that among all the praise afforded the film can be added that city lights also holds the distinction of being chaplins own favorite of all his films
french experimental musician and film critic michel chion has written an analysis of city lights published as les lumières de la ville slavoj žižek used the film as a primary example in his essay why does a letter always arrive at its destination chaplins original tramp suit from the film was donated by him to the museum of natural history of los angeles county
city lights was ranked seventeenth on cahiers du cinéma’s 100 greatest films 
city lights was released as a dual-format blu-ray and dvd by the criterion collection in 2013 both of which include trailers of the film archival footage from production and an audio commentary track by chaplin biographer and scholar jeffrey vance among others the new cover was illustrated by canadian cartoonist seth
