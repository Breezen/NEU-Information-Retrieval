the two moons of mars phobos and deimos are much smaller than the moon greatly reducing the frequency of solar eclipses on that planet neither moons apparent diameter is large enough to cover the disk of the sun and therefore they are annular solar eclipses and can also be considered transits


 eclipses caused by phobos 

due to the small size of phobos about 20 by 25 km 12 by 16 mi and its rapid orbital motion an observer on the surface of mars would never experience a solar eclipse for longer than about thirty seconds phobos also takes only 7 hours 39 minutes to orbit mars while a martian day is 24 hours 37 minutes long meaning that phobos can create two eclipses per martian day these are annular eclipses because phobos is not quite large enough or close enough to mars to create a total solar eclipse


 transits caused by deimos 

deimos is too small about 15 by 10 km 9.3 by 6.2 mi and too far from mars to cause an eclipse the best an observer on mars would see is a small spot crossing the suns disc


 view from earth 
both moons are too small to cast a shadow on mars that can be seen from earth however shortly after the first artificial satellites were placed in orbit around mars the shadow of phobos was seen in pictures transmitted to earth one of these photos was from the nasa rover opportunity
