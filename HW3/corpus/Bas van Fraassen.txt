 philosophical work 
van fraassen coined the term constructive empiricism in his 1980 book the scientific image in which he argued for agnosticism about the reality of unobservable entities that book was widely credited with rehabilitating scientific anti-realism as the stanford encyclopedia explains the constructive empiricist follows the logical positivists in rejecting metaphysical commitments in science but parts with them regarding their endorsement of the verificationist criterion of meaning as well as their endorsement of the suggestion that theory-laden discourse can and should be removed from science before van fraassens the scientific image some philosophers had viewed scientific anti-realism as dead because logical positivism was dead van fraassen showed that there were other ways to be an empiricist with respect to science without following in the footsteps of the logical positivists
in his 1989 book laws and symmetry van fraassen attempted to lay the ground-work for explaining physical phenomena without assuming that such phenomena are caused by rules or laws which can be said to cause or govern their behavior focusing on the problem of underdetermination he argued for the possibility that theories could have empirical equivalence but differ in their ontological commitments he rejects the notion that the aim of science is to produce an account of the physical world that is literally true and instead maintains that its aim is to produce theories that are empirically adequate van fraassen has also studied the philosophy of quantum mechanics philosophical logic and epistemology
van fraassen has been the editor of the journal of philosophical logic and co-editor of the journal of symbolic logic
in his paper singular terms truth-value gaps and free logic van fraassen opens with a very brief introduction of the problem of non-referring names
instead of any unique formalization though he simply adjusts the axioms of a standard predicate logic such as that found in quines methods of logic instead of an axiom like 
  
    
      
        ∀
        x
        
        p
        x
        ⇒
        ∃
        x
        
        p
        x
      
    
    displaystyle forall xpxrightarrow exists xpx
   he uses 
  
    
      
        
        ∀
        x
        
        p
        x
        ∧
        ∃
        x
        
        
        x
        
        a
        
        
        ⇒
        ∃
        x
        
        p
        x
      
    
    displaystyle forall xpxland exists xxarightarrow exists xpx
   this will naturally be true if the existential claim of the antecedent is false if a name fails to refer then an atomic sentence containing it that is not an identity statement can be assigned a truth value arbitrarily free logic is proved to be complete under this interpretation
he indicates that however he sees no good reason to call statements which employ them either true or false some have attempted to solve this problem by means of many-valued logics van fraassen offers in their stead the use of supervaluations questions of completeness change when supervaluations are admitted since they allow for valid arguments that do not correspond to logically true conditionals 
in his essay the anti-realist epistemology of van fraassens the scientific image  paul m churchland one of van fraassens critics contrasted van fraassens idea of unobservable phenomena with the idea of merely unobserved phenomena
