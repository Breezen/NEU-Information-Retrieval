the eclipse of thales was a solar eclipse that was according to the histories of herodotus accurately predicted by the greek philosopher thales of miletus if herodotuss account is accurate this eclipse is the earliest recorded as being known in advance of its occurrence many historians believe that the predicted eclipse was the solar eclipse of may 28 585 bc how exactly thales predicted the eclipse remains uncertain some historians claim the eclipse was never predicted at all others have argued for different dates
according to herodotus the appearance of the eclipse was interpreted as an omen and interrupted a battle in a long-standing war between the medes and the lydians the fighting immediately stopped and they agreed to a truce because astronomers can calculate the dates of historical eclipses isaac asimov described this battle as the earliest historical event whose date is known with precision to the day and described the prediction as the birth of science


 herodotus account 

herodotus the histories 1.73-74 states that a war started in the period between the medes and the lydians there were two reasons for the war the two sides clashing interests in anatolia but also there was a motive of revenge some scythian hunters employed by the medes who once returned empty-handed were insulted by king cyaxares in revenge the hunters slaughtered one of his sons and served him to the medes the hunters then fled to sardis the capital of the lydians when cyaxares asked for the scythians to be returned to him alyattes ii refused to hand them over in response the medes invaded

afterwards on the refusal of alyattes to give up his suppliants when cyaxares sent to demand them of him war broke out between the lydians and the medes and continued for five years with various success in the course of it the medes gained many victories over the lydians and the lydians also gained many victories over the medes among their other battles there was one night engagement as however the balance had not inclined in favour of either nation another combat took place in the sixth year in the course of which just as the battle was growing warm day was on a sudden changed into night this event had been foretold by thales the milesian who forewarned the ionians of it fixing for it the very year in which it actually took place the medes and lydians when they observed the change ceased fighting and were alike anxious to have terms of peace agreed on

as part of the terms of the peace agreement alyattess daughter aryenis was married to cyaxaress son astyages and the halys river now known as the kızılırmak river was declared to be the border of the two warring nations
an alternative theory regarding the date of the battle suggests that herodotus was carelessly recounting events that he did not personally witness and that furthermore the solar eclipse story is a misinterpretation of his text according to this view what happened could have been a lunar eclipse right before moonrise at dusk if the warriors had planned their battle activities expecting a full moon as in the previous few days it would have been quite a shock to have dusk fall suddenly as an occluded moon rose if this theory is correct the battles date would be not 585 bc date given by pliny based on date of solar eclipse but possibly 3 sept 609 bc or 4 july 587 bc dates when such dusk-time lunar eclipses did occur


 thales prediction 
while doubt has been cast on the truth of the story there are other accounts of it besides that of herodotus diogenes laertius says that xenophanes who lived in the same century as thales was impressed with the prediction and he also gives additional testimonies from the pre-socratics democritus and heraclitus
at the time of thales purported prediction it was not yet known that eclipses were caused by the moon coming between the earth and the sun a fact that would not be discovered until over a century later by either anaxagoras or empedocles
if the account is true it has been suggested that thales would have had to calculate the timing of any eclipse by recognizing patterns in the periodicities of eclipses it has been postulated that thales may have used the saros cycle in his determination or that he may have had some knowledge of babylonian astronomy but as there is no known cycle that can be reliably used to predict an eclipse for a given location any accurate prediction would have been down to luck


 the eclipse 
the eclipse peaked over the atlantic ocean at 37.9°n 46.2°w﻿  37.9 -46.2﻿ battle of halys eclipse peak and the umbral path reached south-western anatolia in the evening hours and the halys river is just within the error margin for delta-t provided
