annalen der physik english annals of physics is one of the oldest scientific journals on physics and has been published since 1799 the journal publishes original peer-reviewed papers in the areas of experimental theoretical applied and mathematical physics and related areas the current editor-in-chief is stefan hildebrandt prior to 2008 its iso 4 abbreviation was ann phys leipzig and after 2008 ann phys berl
the journal is the successor to journal der physik published from 1790 until 1794 and neues journal der physik published from 1795 until 1797 the journal has been published under a variety of names annalen der physik annalen der physik und der physikalischen chemie annalen der physik und chemie wiedemanns annalen der physik und chemie during its history


 history 
originally annalen der physik was published in german from the 1950s to the 1980s the journal published in both german and english initially only foreign authors contributed articles in english but from the 1970s german-speaking authors increasingly wrote in english in order to reach an international audience after the german reunification in 1990 english became the only language of the journal
the importance of annalen der physik unquestionably peaked in 1905 with albert einsteins annus mirabilis papers in the 1920s the journal lost ground to the concurrent zeitschrift für physik with the 1933 emigration wave german-language journals lost many of their best authors from 1944–1946 publication was interrupted because of world war ii but resumed in 1947 under soviet occupation rule while zeitschrift für physik moved to western germany annalen der physik served physicists in east germany after the german reunification the journal was acquired by wiley-vch
a relaunch of the journal with new editor and new contents was announced for 2012 as a result of the 2012 relaunch annalen der physik now features a refocused scope an updated editorial board and new more modern cover designs


 editors 
the early editors-in-chief were
friedrich albrecht carl gren 1790–1797 as journal der physik and neues journal der physik
ludwig wilhelm gilbert 1799–1824 as annalen der physik and annalen der physik und der physikalischen chemie
johann christian poggendorff 1824–1876 as annalen der physik und chemie
gustav heinrich wiedemann 1877–1899 as annalen der physik und chemie
paul karl ludwig drude 1900–1906 as annalen der physik
with each editor the numbering of volumes restarted from 1 co-existent with a continuous numbering a perpetual source of confusion the journal was often referred to by the editors name gilberts annalen poggendorfs annalen wiedemanns annalen and so on or for short pogg ann wied ann
after drude the work was divided between two editors experimentalists wilhelm wien 1907–1928 and eduard grüneisen 1929–1949 and theoretician max planck 1907–1943 had been associate editor from 1895
in these times peer-review was not yet standard einstein for example just sent his manuscripts to planck who then subsequently published them
