capillary action sometimes capillarity capillary motion capillary effect or wicking is the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of or even in opposition to external forces like gravity the effect can be seen in the drawing up of liquids between the hair of a paint-brush in a thin tube in porous materials such as paper and plaster in some non-porous materials such as sand and liquefied carbon fiber or in a cell it occurs because of intermolecular forces between the liquid and surrounding solid surfaces if the diameter of the tube is sufficiently small then the combination of surface tension which is caused by cohesion within the liquid and adhesive forces between the liquid and container wall act to propel the liquid


 history 
the first recorded observation of capillary action was by leonardo da vinci a former student of galileo niccolò aggiunti was said to have investigated capillary action in 1660 capillary action was still a novelty to the irish chemist robert boyle when he reported that some inquisitive french men had observed that when a capillary tube was dipped into water the water would ascend to some height in the pipe boyle then reported an experiment in which he dipped a capillary tube into red wine and then subjected the tube to a partial vacuum he found that the vacuum had no observable influence on the height of the liquid in the capillary so the behavior of liquids in capillary tubes was due to some phenomenon different from that which governed mercury barometers
others soon followed boyles lead some eg honoré fabri jacob bernoulli thought that liquids rose in capillaries because air could not enter capillaries as easily as liquids so the air pressure was lower inside capillaries others eg isaac vossius giovanni alfonso borelli louis carré francis hauksbee josia weitbrecht thought that the particles of liquid were attracted to each other and to the walls of the capillary
although experimental studies continued during the 18th century a successful quantitative treatment of capillary action was not attained until 1805 by two investigators thomas young of the united kingdom and pierre-simon laplace of france they derived the young–laplace equation of capillary action by 1830 the german mathematician carl friedrich gauss had determined the boundary conditions governing capillary action ie the conditions at the liquid-solid interface in 1871 the british physicist william thomson lord kelvin determined the effect of the meniscus on a liquids vapor pressure—a relation known as the kelvin equation german physicist franz ernst neumann 1798–1895 subsequently determined the interaction between two immiscible liquids
albert einsteins first paper which was submitted to annalen der physik in 1900 was on capillarity


 phenomena and physics of capillary action 

a common apparatus used to demonstrate the phenomenon is the capillary tube when the lower end of a vertical glass tube is placed in a liquid such as water a concave meniscus forms adhesion occurs between the fluid and the solid inner wall pulling the liquid column up until there is a sufficient mass of liquid for gravitational forces to overcome these intermolecular forces the contact length around the edge between the top of the liquid column and the tube is proportional to the radius of the tube while the weight of the liquid column is proportional to the square of the tubes radius so a narrow tube will draw a liquid column higher than a wider tube will given that the inner water molecules cohere sufficiently to the outer ones


 in plants and animals 
capillary action is seen in many plants water is brought high up in trees by branching evaporation at the leaves creating depressurization probably by osmotic pressure added at the roots and possibly at other locations inside the plant especially when gathering humidity with air roots
capillary action for uptake of water has been described in some small animals such as ligia exotica and moloch horridus


 examples 
capillary action is essential for the drainage of constantly produced tear fluid from the eye two canaliculi of tiny diameter are present in the inner corner of the eyelid also called the lacrimal ducts their openings can be seen with the naked eye within the lacrymal sacs when the eyelids are everted
wicking is the absorption of a liquid by a material in the manner of a candle wick paper towels absorb liquid through capillary action allowing a fluid to be transferred from a surface to the towel the small pores of a sponge act as small capillaries causing it to absorb a large amount of fluid some textile fabrics are said to use capillary action to wick sweat away from the skin these are often referred to as wicking fabrics after the capillary properties of candle and lamp wicks
capillary action is observed in thin layer chromatography in which a solvent moves vertically up a plate via capillary action in this case the pores are gaps between very small particles
capillary action draws ink to the tips of fountain pen nibs from a reservoir or cartridge inside the pen
with some pairs of materials such as mercury and glass the intermolecular forces within the liquid exceed those between the solid and the liquid so a convex meniscus forms and capillary action works in reverse
in hydrology capillary action describes the attraction of water molecules to soil particles capillary action is responsible for moving groundwater from wet areas of the soil to dry areas differences in soil potential

thus for a 2 m 6.6 ft radius glass tube in lab conditions given above the water would rise an unnoticeable 0.007 mm 0.00028 in however for a 2 cm 0.79 in radius tube the water would rise 0.7 mm 0.028 in and for a 0.2 mm 0.0079 in radius tube the water would rise 70 mm 2.8 in


 liquid transport in porous media 

when a dry porous medium such as a brick or a wick is brought into contact with a liquid it will start absorbing the liquid at a rate which decreases over time when considering evaporation liquid penetration will reach a limit dependent on parameters of temperature humidity and permeability for a bar of material with cross-sectional area a that is wetted on one end the cumulative volume v of absorbed liquid after a time t is

some authors use the quantity sf as the sorptivity the above description is for the case where gravity and evaporation do not play a role
sorptivity is a relevant property of building materials because it affects the amount of rising dampness some values for the sorptivity of building materials are in the table below
