 biographyedit 


 1889–1913 early yearsedit 


 background and childhood hardshipedit 
charles spencer chaplin was born on 16 april 1889 to hannah chaplin born hannah harriet pedlingham hill and charles chaplin sr there is no official record of his birth although chaplin believed he was born at east street walworth in south london his mother and father had married four years previously at which time charles sr became the legal carer of hannahs illegitimate son sydney john hill at the time of his birth chaplins parents were both music hall entertainers hannah the daughter of a shoemaker had a brief and unsuccessful career under the stage name lily harley while charles sr a butchers son was a popular singer although they never divorced chaplins parents were estranged by around 1891 the following year hannah gave birth to a third son – george wheeler dryden – fathered by the music hall entertainer leo dryden the child was taken by dryden at six months old and did not re-enter chaplins life for 30 years

chaplins childhood was fraught with poverty and hardship making his eventual trajectory the most dramatic of all the rags to riches stories ever told according to his authorised biographer david robinson chaplins early years were spent with his mother and brother sydney in the london district of kennington hannah had no means of income other than occasional nursing and dressmaking and chaplin sr provided no financial support as the situation deteriorated chaplin was sent to lambeth workhouse when he was seven years old the council housed him at the central london district school for paupers which chaplin remembered as a forlorn existence he was briefly reunited with his mother 18 months later before hannah was forced to readmit her family to the workhouse in july 1898 the boys were promptly sent to norwood schools another institution for destitute children

in september 1898 hannah was committed to cane hill mental asylum – she had developed a psychosis seemingly brought on by an infection of syphilis and malnutrition for the two months she was there chaplin and his brother sydney were sent to live with their father whom the young boys scarcely knew charles sr was by then a severe alcoholic and life there was bad enough to provoke a visit from the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children chaplins father died two years later at 38 years old from cirrhosis of the liver
hannah entered a period of remission but in may 1903 became ill again chaplin then 14 had the task of taking his mother to the infirmary from where she was sent back to cane hill he lived alone for several days searching for food and occasionally sleeping rough until sydney – who had enrolled in the navy two years earlier – returned hannah was released from the asylum eight months later but in march 1905 her illness returned this time permanently there was nothing we could do but accept poor mothers fate chaplin later wrote and she remained in care until her death in 1928


 young performeredit 

between his time in the poor schools and his mother succumbing to mental illness chaplin began to perform on stage he later recalled making his first amateur appearance at the age of five years when he took over from hannah one night in aldershot this was an isolated occurrence but by the time he was nine chaplin had with his mothers encouragement grown interested in performing he later wrote she imbued me with the feeling that i had some sort of talent through his fathers connections chaplin became a member of the eight lancashire lads clog-dancing troupe with whom he toured english music halls throughout 1899 and 1900 chaplin worked hard and the act was popular with audiences but he was not satisfied with dancing and wished to form a comedy act
in the years chaplin was touring with the eight lancashire lads his mother ensured that he still attended school but by age 13 he had abandoned education he supported himself with a range of jobs while nursing his ambition to become an actor at 14 shortly after his mothers relapse he registered with a theatrical agency in londons west end the manager sensed potential in chaplin who was promptly given his first role as a newsboy in harry arthur saintsburys jim a romance of cockayne it opened in july 1903 but the show was unsuccessful and closed after two weeks chaplins comic performance however was singled out for praise in many of the reviews
saintsbury secured a role for chaplin in charles frohmans production of sherlock holmes where he played billy the pageboy in three nationwide tours his performance was so well received that he was called to london to play the role alongside william gillette the original holmes it was like tidings from heaven chaplin recalled at 16 years old chaplin starred in the plays west end production at the duke of yorks theatre from october to december 1905 he completed one final tour of sherlock holmes in early 1906 before leaving the play after more than two-and-a-half years


 stage comedy and vaudevilleedit 
chaplin soon found work with a new company and went on tour with his brother – who was also pursuing an acting career – in a comedy sketch called repairs in may 1906 chaplin joined the juvenile act caseys circus where he developed popular burlesque pieces and was soon the star of the show by the time the act finished touring in july 1907 the 18-year-old had become an accomplished comedic performer he struggled to find more work however and a brief attempt at a solo act was a failure

meanwhile sydney chaplin had joined fred karnos prestigious comedy company in 1906 and by 1908 he was one of their key performers in february he managed to secure a two-week trial for his younger brother karno was initially wary and considered chaplin a pale puny sullen-looking youngster who looked much too shy to do any good in the theatre however the teenager made an impact on his first night at the london coliseum and he was quickly signed to a contract chaplin began by playing a series of minor parts eventually progressing to starring roles in 1909 in april 1910 he was given the lead in a new sketch jimmy the fearless it was a big success and chaplin received considerable press attention
karno selected his new star to join the section of the company one that also included stan laurel that toured north americas vaudeville circuit the young comedian headed the show and impressed reviewers being described as one of the best pantomime artists ever seen here his most successful role was a drunk called the inebriate swell which drew him significant recognition the tour lasted 21 months and the troupe returned to england in june 1912 chaplin recalled that he had a disquieting feeling of sinking back into a depressing commonplaceness and was therefore delighted when a new tour began in october


 1914–1917 entering filmsedit 


 keystoneedit 
six months into the second american tour chaplin was invited to join the new york motion picture company a representative who had seen his performances thought he could replace fred mace a star of their keystone studios who intended to leave chaplin thought the keystone comedies a crude mélange of rough and rumble but liked the idea of working in films and rationalised besides it would mean a new life he met with the company and signed a 150-per-week 3,714 in 2017 dollars contract in september 1913

chaplin arrived in los angeles home of the keystone studio in early december 1913 his boss was mack sennett who initially expressed concern that the 24-year-old looked too young he was not used in a picture until late january during which time chaplin attempted to learn the processes of filmmaking the one-reeler making a living marked his film acting debut and was released on 2 february 1914 chaplin strongly disliked the picture but one review picked him out as a comedian of the first water for his second appearance in front of the camera chaplin selected the costume with which he became identified he described the process in his autobiography

i wanted everything to be a contradiction the pants baggy the coat tight the hat small and the shoes large  i added a small moustache which i reasoned would add age without hiding my expression i had no idea of the character but the moment i was dressed the clothes and the makeup made me feel the person he was i began to know him and by the time i walked on stage he was fully born

the film was mabels strange predicament but the tramp character as it became known debuted to audiences in kid auto races at venice – shot later than mabels strange predicament but released two days earlier chaplin adopted the character as his screen persona and attempted to make suggestions for the films he appeared in these ideas were dismissed by his directors during the filming of his eleventh picture mabel at the wheel he clashed with director mabel normand and was almost released from his contract sennett kept him on however when he received orders from exhibitors for more chaplin films sennett also allowed chaplin to direct his next film himself after chaplin promised to pay 1,500 37,141 in 2017 dollars if the film was unsuccessful
caught in the rain issued 4 may 1914 was chaplins directorial debut and was highly successful thereafter he directed almost every short film in which he appeared for keystone at the rate of approximately one per week a period which he later remembered as the most exciting time of his career chaplins films introduced a slower form of comedy than the typical keystone farce and he developed a large fan base in november 1914 he had a supporting role in the first feature length comedy film tillies punctured romance directed by sennett and starring marie dressler which was a commercial success and increased his popularity when chaplins contract came up for renewal at the end of the year he asked for 1,000 a week 24,761 in 2017 dollars – an amount sennett refused as too large


 essanayedit 

the essanay film manufacturing company of chicago sent chaplin an offer of 1,250 a week with a signing bonus of 10,000 he joined the studio in late december 1914 where he began forming a stock company of regular players including leo white bud jamison paddy mcguire and billy armstrong he soon recruited a leading lady – edna purviance whom chaplin met in a cafe and hired on account of her beauty she went on to appear in 35 films with chaplin over eight years the pair also formed a romantic relationship that lasted into 1917
chaplin asserted a high level of control over his pictures and started to put more time and care into each film there was a month-long interval between the release of his second production a night out and his third the champion the final seven of chaplins 14 essanay films were all produced at this slower pace chaplin also began to alter his screen persona which had attracted some criticism at keystone for its mean crude and brutish nature the character became more gentle and romantic the tramp april 1915 was considered a particular turning point in his development the use of pathos was developed further with the bank in which chaplin created a sad ending robinson notes that this was an innovation in comedy films and marked the time when serious critics began to appreciate chaplins work at essanay writes film scholar simon louvish chaplin found the themes and the settings that would define the tramps world
during 1915 chaplin became a cultural phenomenon shops were stocked with chaplin merchandise he was featured in cartoons and comic strips and several songs were written about him in july a journalist for motion picture magazine wrote that chaplinitis had spread across america as his fame grew worldwide he became the film industrys first international star when the essanay contract ended in december 1915 chaplin – fully aware of his popularity – requested a 150,000 signing bonus from his next studio he received several offers including universal fox and vitagraph the best of which came from the mutual film corporation at 10,000 a week


 mutualedit 

a contract was negotiated with mutual that amounted to 670,000 a year which robinson says made chaplin – at 26 years old – one of the highest paid people in the world the high salary shocked the public and was widely reported in the press john r freuler the studio president explained we can afford to pay mr chaplin this large sum annually because the public wants chaplin and will pay for him
mutual gave chaplin his own los angeles studio to work in which opened in march 1916 he added two key members to his stock company albert austin and eric campbell and produced a series of elaborate two-reelers the floorwalker the fireman the vagabond one am and the count for the pawnshop he recruited the actor henry bergman who was to work with chaplin for 30 years behind the screen and the rink completed chaplins releases for 1916 the mutual contract stipulated that he release a two-reel film every four weeks which he had managed to achieve with the new year however chaplin began to demand more time he made only four more films for mutual over the first ten months of 1917 easy street the cure the immigrant and the adventurer with their careful construction these films are considered by chaplin scholars to be among his finest work later in life chaplin referred to his mutual years as the happiest period of his career however chaplin also felt that those films became increasingly formulaic over the period of the contract and he was increasingly dissatisfied with the working conditions encouraging that 
chaplin was attacked in the british media for not fighting in the first world war he defended himself revealing that he would fight for britain if called and had registered for the american draft but he was not summoned by either country despite this criticism chaplin was a favourite with the troops and his popularity continued to grow worldwide harpers weekly reported that the name of charlie chaplin was a part of the common language of almost every country and that the tramp image was universally familiar in 1917 professional chaplin imitators were so widespread that he took legal action and it was reported that nine out of ten men who attended costume parties dressed as the tramp the same year a study by the boston society for psychical research concluded that chaplin was an american obsession the actress minnie maddern fiske wrote that a constantly increasing body of cultured artistic people are beginning to regard the young english buffoon charles chaplin as an extraordinary artist as well as a comic genius


 1918–1922 first nationaledit 

mutual were patient with chaplins decreased rate of output and the contract ended amicably with his aforementioned concern about the declining quality of his films because of contract scheduling stipulations chaplins primary concern in finding a new distributor was independence sydney chaplin then his business manager told the press charlie must be allowed all the time he needs and all the money for producing films the way he wants  it is quality not quantity we are after in june 1917 chaplin signed to complete eight films for first national exhibitors circuit in return for 1 million he chose to build his own studio situated on five acres of land off sunset boulevard with production facilities of the highest order it was completed in january 1918 and chaplin was given freedom over the making of his pictures
a dogs life released april 1918 was the first film under the new contract in it chaplin demonstrated his increasing concern with story construction and his treatment of the tramp as a sort of pierrot the film was described by louis delluc as cinemas first total work of art chaplin then embarked on the third liberty bond campaign touring the united states for one month to raise money for the allies of the first world war he also produced a short propaganda film donated to the government for fund-raising called the bond chaplins next release was war-based placing the tramp in the trenches for shoulder arms associates warned him against making a comedy about the war but as he later recalled dangerous or not the idea excited me he spent four months filming the 45-minute-long picture which was released in october 1918 with great success


 united artists mildred harris and the kidedit 
after the release of shoulder arms chaplin requested more money from first national which was refused frustrated with their lack of concern for quality and worried about rumours of a possible merger between the company and famous players-lasky chaplin joined forces with douglas fairbanks mary pickford and d w griffith to form a new distribution company – united artists established in january 1919 the arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry as it enabled the four partners – all creative artists – to personally fund their pictures and have complete control chaplin was eager to start with the new company and offered to buy out his contract with first national they refused and insisted that he complete the final six films owed

before the creation of united artists chaplin married for the first time the 16-year-old actress mildred harris had revealed that she was pregnant with his child and in september 1918 he married her quietly in los angeles to avoid controversy soon after the pregnancy was found to be false chaplin was unhappy with the union and feeling that marriage stunted his creativity struggled over the production of his film sunnyside harris was by then legitimately pregnant and on 7 july 1919 gave birth to a son norman spencer chaplin was born malformed and died three days later the marriage ended in april 1920 with chaplin explaining in his autobiography that they were irreconcilably mismated
losing the child plus his own childhood experiences are thought to have influenced chaplins film which turned the tramp into the caretaker of a young boy for this new venture chaplin also wished to do more than comedy and according to louvish make his mark on a changed world filming on the kid began in august 1919 with four-year-old jackie coogan his co-star it was developing into a long project so to placate first national he halted production and quickly filmed a days pleasure the kid was in production for nine months until may 1920 and at 68 minutes it was chaplins longest picture to date dealing with issues of poverty and parent–child separation the kid was one of the earliest films to combine comedy and drama it was released in january 1921 with instant success and by 1924 had been screened in over 50 countries
chaplin spent five months on his next film the two-reeler the idle class following its september 1921 release he chose to return to england for the first time in almost a decade he then worked to fulfil his first national contract releasing pay day in february 1922 the pilgrim – his final short film – was delayed by distribution disagreements with the studio and released a year later


 1923–1938 silent featuresedit 


 a woman of paris and the gold rushedit 
having fulfilled his first national contract chaplin was free to make his first picture as an independent producer in november 1922 he began filming a woman of paris a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers chaplin intended it to be a star-making vehicle for edna purviance and did not appear in the picture himself other than in a brief uncredited cameo he wished the film to have a realistic feel and directed his cast to give restrained performances in real life he explained men and women try to hide their emotions rather than seek to express them a woman of paris premiered in september 1923 and was acclaimed for its innovative subtle approach the public however seemed to have little interest in a chaplin film without chaplin and it was a box office disappointment the filmmaker was hurt by this failure – he had long wanted to produce a dramatic film and was proud of the result – and soon withdrew a woman of paris from circulation

chaplin returned to comedy for his next project setting his standards high he told himself this next film must be an epic the greatest inspired by a photograph of the 1898 klondike gold rush and later the story of the donner party of 1846–47 he made what geoffrey macnab calls an epic comedy out of grim subject matter in the gold rush the tramp is a lonely prospector fighting adversity and looking for love with georgia hale as his new leading lady chaplin began filming the picture in february 1924 its elaborate production costing almost 1 million included location shooting in the truckee mountains with 600 extras extravagant sets and special effects the last scene was shot may 1925 after 15 months of filming
chaplin felt the gold rush was the best film he had made it opened in august 1925 and became one of the highest-grossing films of the silent era with a us box-office of 5 million the comedy contains some of chaplins most famous sequences such as the tramp eating his shoe and the dance of the rolls macnab has called it the quintessential chaplin film chaplin stated at its release this is the picture that i want to be remembered by


 lita grey and the circusedit 

while making the gold rush chaplin married for the second time mirroring the circumstances of his first union lita grey was a teenage actress originally set to star in the film whose surprise announcement of pregnancy forced chaplin into marriage she was 16 and he was 35 meaning chaplin could have been charged with statutory rape under california law he therefore arranged a discreet marriage in mexico on 25 november 1924 their first son charles spencer chaplin jr was born on 5 may 1925 followed by sydney earl chaplin on 30 march 1926
it was an unhappy marriage and chaplin spent long hours at the studio to avoid seeing his wife in november 1926 grey took the children and left the family home a bitter divorce followed in which greys application – accusing chaplin of infidelity abuse and of harbouring perverted sexual desires – was leaked to the press chaplin was reported to be in a state of nervous breakdown as the story became headline news and groups formed across america calling for his films to be banned eager to end the case without further scandal chaplins lawyers agreed to a cash settlement of 600,000 – the largest awarded by american courts at that time his fan base was strong enough to survive the incident and it was soon forgotten but chaplin was deeply affected by it
before the divorce suit was filed chaplin had begun work on a new film the circus he built a story around the idea of walking a tightrope while besieged by monkeys and turned the tramp into the accidental star of a circus filming was suspended for 10 months while he dealt with the divorce scandal and it was generally a trouble-ridden production finally completed in october 1927 the circus was released in january 1928 to a positive reception at the 1st academy awards chaplin was given a special trophy for versatility and genius in acting writing directing and producing the circus despite its success he permanently associated the film with the stress of its production chaplin omitted the circus from his autobiography and struggled to work on it when he recorded the score in his later years


 city lightsedit 

by the time the circus was released hollywood had witnessed the introduction of sound films chaplin was cynical about this new medium and the technical shortcomings it presented believing that talkies lacked the artistry of silent films he was also hesitant to change the formula that had brought him such success and feared that giving the tramp a voice would limit his international appeal he therefore rejected the new hollywood craze and began work on a new silent film chaplin was nonetheless anxious about this decision and remained so throughout the films production

when filming began at the end of 1928 chaplin had been working on the story for almost a year city lights followed the tramps love for a blind flower girl played by virginia cherrill and his efforts to raise money for her sight-saving operation it was a challenging production that lasted 21 months with chaplin later confessing that he had worked himself into a neurotic state of wanting perfection one advantage chaplin found in sound technology was the opportunity to record a musical score for the film which he composed himself
chaplin finished editing city lights in december 1930 by which time silent films were an anachronism a preview before an unsuspecting public audience was not a success but a showing for the press produced positive reviews one journalist wrote nobody in the world but charlie chaplin could have done it he is the only person that has that peculiar something called audience appeal in sufficient quality to defy the popular penchant for movies that talk given its general release in january 1931 city lights proved to be a popular and financial success – eventually grossing over 3 million the british film institute cites it as chaplins finest accomplishment and the critic james agee hails the closing scene as the greatest piece of acting and the highest moment in movies city lights became chaplins personal favourite of his films and remained so throughout his life


 travels paulette goddard and modern timesedit 
city lights had been a success but chaplin was unsure if he could make another picture without dialogue he remained convinced that sound would not work in his films but was also obsessed by a depressing fear of being old-fashioned in this state of uncertainty early in 1931 the comedian decided to take a holiday and ended up travelling for 16 months he spent months travelling western europe including extended stays in france and switzerland and spontaneously decided to visit japan the day after he arrived in japan prime minister inukai tsuyoshi was assassinated by ultra-nationalists in the may 15 incident the groups original plan had been to provoke a war with the united states by assassinating chaplin at a welcome reception organised by the prime minister but the plan had been foiled due to delayed public announcement of the events date

in his autobiography chaplin recalled that on his return to los angeles i was confused and without plan restless and conscious of an extreme loneliness he briefly considered retiring and moving to china chaplins loneliness was relieved when he met 21-year-old actress paulette goddard in july 1932 and the pair began a relationship he was not ready to commit to a film however and focused on writing a serial about his travels published in womans home companion the trip had been a stimulating experience for chaplin including meetings with several prominent thinkers and he became increasingly interested in world affairs the state of labour in america troubled him and he feared that capitalism and machinery in the workplace would increase unemployment levels it was these concerns that stimulated chaplin to develop his new film
modern times was announced by chaplin as a satire on certain phases of our industrial life featuring the tramp and goddard as they endure the great depression it took ten and a half months to film chaplin intended to use spoken dialogue but changed his mind during rehearsals like its predecessor modern times employed sound effects but almost no speaking chaplins performance of a gibberish song did however give the tramp a voice for the only time on film after recording the music chaplin released modern times in february 1936 it was his first feature in 15 years to adopt political references and social realism a factor that attracted considerable press coverage despite chaplins attempts to downplay the issue the film earned less at the box-office than his previous features and received mixed reviews as some viewers disliked the politicising today modern times is seen by the british film institute as one of chaplins great features while david robinson says it shows the filmmaker at his unrivalled peak as a creator of visual comedy
following the release of modern times chaplin left with goddard for a trip to the far east the couple had refused to comment on the nature of their relationship and it was not known whether they were married or not some time later chaplin revealed that they married in canton during this trip by 1938 the couple had drifted apart as both focused heavily on their work although goddard was again his leading lady in his next feature film the great dictator she eventually divorced chaplin in mexico in 1942 citing incompatibility and separation for more than a year


 1939–1952 controversies and fading popularityedit 


 the great dictatoredit 

the 1940s saw chaplin face a series of controversies both in his work and in his personal life which changed his fortunes and severely affected his popularity in the united states the first of these was his growing boldness in expressing his political beliefs deeply disturbed by the surge of militaristic nationalism in 1930s world politics chaplin found that he could not keep these issues out of his work parallels between himself and adolf hitler had been widely noted the pair were born four days apart both had risen from poverty to world prominence and hitler wore the same toothbrush moustache as chaplin it was this physical resemblance that supplied the plot for chaplins next film the great dictator which directly satirised hitler and attacked fascism
chaplin spent two years developing the script and began filming in september 1939 – six days after britain declared war on germany he had submitted to using spoken dialogue partly out of acceptance that he had no other choice but also because he recognised it as a better method for delivering a political message making a comedy about hitler was seen as highly controversial but chaplins financial independence allowed him to take the risk i was determined to go ahead he later wrote for hitler must be laughed at chaplin replaced the tramp while wearing similar attire with a jewish barber a reference to the nazi partys belief that he was jewish in a dual performance he also played the dictator adenoid hynkel who parodied hitler
the great dictator spent a year in production and was released in october 1940 the film generated a vast amount of publicity with a critic for the new york times calling it the most eagerly awaited picture of the year and it was one of the biggest money-makers of the era the ending was unpopular however and generated controversy chaplin concluded the film with a five-minute speech in which he abandoned his barber character looked directly into the camera and pleaded against war and fascism charles j maland has identified this overt preaching as triggering a decline in chaplins popularity and writes henceforth no movie fan would ever be able to separate the dimension of politics from his star image the great dictator received five academy award nominations including best picture best original screenplay and best actor


 legal troubles and oona oneilledit 
in the mid-1940s chaplin was involved in a series of trials that occupied most of his time and significantly affected his public image the troubles stemmed from his affair with an aspirant actress named joan barry with whom he was involved intermittently between june 1941 and the autumn of 1942 barry who displayed obsessive behaviour and was twice arrested after they separated reappeared the following year and announced that she was pregnant with chaplins child as chaplin denied the claim barry filed a paternity suit against him
the director of the federal bureau of investigation fbi j edgar hoover who had long been suspicious of chaplins political leanings used the opportunity to generate negative publicity about him as part of a smear campaign to damage chaplins image the fbi named him in four indictments related to the barry case most serious of these was an alleged violation of the mann act which prohibits the transportation of women across state boundaries for sexual purposes the historian otto friedrich has called this an absurd prosecution of an ancient statute yet if chaplin was found guilty he faced 23 years in jail three charges lacked sufficient evidence to proceed to court but the mann act trial began in march 1944 chaplin was acquitted two weeks later the case was frequently headline news with newsweek calling it the biggest public relations scandal since the fatty arbuckle murder trial in 1921

barrys child carole ann was born in october 1944 and the paternity suit went to court in february 1945 after two arduous trials in which the prosecuting lawyer accused him of moral turpitude chaplin was declared to be the father evidence from blood tests which indicated otherwise were not admissible and the judge ordered chaplin to pay child support until carole ann turned 21 media coverage of the paternity suit was influenced by the fbi as information was fed to the prominent gossip columnist hedda hopper and chaplin was portrayed in an overwhelmingly critical light
the controversy surrounding chaplin increased when two weeks after the paternity suit was filed it was announced that he had married his newest protégée 18-year-old oona oneill – daughter of the american playwright eugene oneill chaplin then 54 had been introduced to her by a film agent seven months earlier in his autobiography chaplin described meeting oneill as the happiest event of my life and claimed to have found perfect love chaplins son charles jr reported that oona worshipped his father the couple remained married until chaplins death and had eight children over 18 years geraldine leigh b july 1944 michael john b march 1946 josephine hannah b march 1949 victoria b may 1951 eugene anthony b august 1953 jane cecil b may 1957 annette emily b december 1959 and christopher james b july 1962


 monsieur verdoux and communist accusationsedit 

chaplin claimed that the barry trials had crippled his creativeness and it was some time before he began working again in april 1946 he finally began filming a project that had been in development since 1942 monsieur verdoux was a black comedy the story of a french bank clerk verdoux chaplin who loses his job and begins marrying and murdering wealthy widows to support his family chaplins inspiration for the project came from orson welles who wanted him to star in a film about the french serial killer henri désiré landru chaplin decided that the concept would make a wonderful comedy and paid welles 5,000 for the idea
chaplin again vocalised his political views in monsieur verdoux criticising capitalism and arguing that the world encourages mass killing through wars and weapons of mass destruction because of this the film met with controversy when it was released in april 1947 chaplin was booed at the premiere and there were calls for a boycott monsieur verdoux was the first chaplin release that failed both critically and commercially in the united states it was more successful abroad and chaplins screenplay was nominated at the academy awards he was proud of the film writing in his autobiography monsieur verdoux is the cleverest and most brilliant film i have yet made
the negative reaction to monsieur verdoux was largely the result of changes in chaplins public image along with damage of the joan barry scandal he was publicly accused of being a communist his political activity had heightened during world war ii when he campaigned for the opening of a second front to help the soviet union and supported various soviet–american friendship groups he was also friendly with several suspected communists and attended functions given by soviet diplomats in los angeles in the political climate of 1940s america such activities meant chaplin was considered as larcher writes dangerously progressive and amoral the fbi wanted him out of the country and launched an official investigation in early 1947
chaplin denied being a communist instead calling himself a peacemonger but felt the governments effort to suppress the ideology was an unacceptable infringement of civil liberties unwilling to be quiet about the issue he openly protested against the trials of communist party members and the activities of the house un-american activities committee chaplin received a subpoena to appear before huac but was not called to testify as his activities were widely reported in the press and cold war fears grew questions were raised over his failure to take american citizenship calls were made for him to be deported in one extreme and widely published example representative john e rankin who helped establish huac told congress in june 1947 chaplins very life in hollywood is detrimental to the moral fabric of america if he is deported  his loathsome pictures can be kept from before the eyes of the american youth he should be deported and gotten rid of at once


 limelight and banning from the united statesedit 

although chaplin remained politically active in the years following the failure of monsieur verdoux his next film about a forgotten vaudeville comedian and a young ballerina in edwardian london was devoid of political themes limelight was heavily autobiographical alluding not only to chaplins childhood and the lives of his parents but also to his loss of popularity in the united states the cast included various members of his family including his five oldest children and his half-brother wheeler dryden
filming began in november 1951 by which time chaplin had spent three years working on the story he aimed for a more serious tone than any of his previous films regularly using the word melancholy when explaining his plans to his co-star claire bloom limelight featured a cameo appearance from buster keaton whom chaplin cast as his stage partner in a pantomime scene this marked the only time the comedians worked together
chaplin decided to hold the world premiere of limelight in london since it was the setting of the film as he left los angeles he expressed a premonition that he would not be returning at new york he boarded the rms queen elizabeth with his family on 18 september 1952 the next day attorney general james p mcgranery revoked chaplins re-entry permit and stated that he would have to submit to an interview concerning his political views and moral behaviour in order to re-enter the us although mcgranery told the press that he had a pretty good case against chaplin maland has concluded on the basis of the fbi files that were released in the 1980s that the us government had no real evidence to prevent chaplins re-entry it is likely that he would have gained entry if he had applied for it however when chaplin received a cablegram informing him of the news he privately decided to cut his ties with the united states

whether i re-entered that unhappy country or not was of little consequence to me i would like to have told them that the sooner i was rid of that hate-beleaguered atmosphere the better that i was fed up of americas insults and moral pomposity

because all of his property remained in america chaplin refrained from saying anything negative about the incident to the press the scandal attracted vast attention but chaplin and his film were warmly received in europe in america the hostility towards him continued and although it received some positive reviews limelight was subjected to a wide-scale boycott reflecting on this maland writes that chaplins fall from an unprecedented level of popularity may be the most dramatic in the history of stardom in america


 1953–1977 european yearsedit 


 move to switzerland and a king in new yorkedit 

chaplin did not attempt to return to the united states after his re-entry permit was revoked and instead sent his wife to settle his affairs the couple decided to settle in switzerland and in january 1953 the family moved into their permanent home manoir de ban a 14-hectare 35-acre estate overlooking lake geneva in corsier-sur-vevey chaplin put his beverly hills house and studio up for sale in march and surrendered his re-entry permit in april the next year his wife renounced her us citizenship and became a british citizen chaplin severed the last of his professional ties with the united states in 1955 when he sold the remainder of his stock in united artists which had been in financial difficulty since the early 1940s

chaplin remained a controversial figure throughout the 1950s especially after he was awarded the international peace prize by the communist-led world peace council and after his meetings with zhou enlai and nikita khrushchev he began developing his first european film a king in new york in 1954 casting himself as an exiled king who seeks asylum in the united states chaplin included several of his recent experiences in the screenplay his son michael was cast as a boy whose parents are targeted by the fbi while chaplins character faces accusations of communism the political satire parodied huac and attacked elements of 1950s culture – including consumerism plastic surgery and wide-screen cinema in a review the playwright john osborne called it chaplins most bitter and most openly personal film
chaplin founded a new production company attica and used shepperton studios for the shooting filming in england proved a difficult experience as he was used to his own hollywood studio and familiar crew and no longer had limitless production time according to robinson this had an effect on the quality of the film a king in new york was released in september 1957 and received mixed reviews chaplin banned american journalists from its paris première and decided not to release the film in the united states this severely limited its revenue although it achieved moderate commercial success in europe a king in new york was not shown in america until 1973


 final works and renewed appreciationedit 

in the last two decades of his career chaplin concentrated on re-editing and scoring his old films for re-release along with securing their ownership and distribution rights in an interview he granted in 1959 the year of his 70th birthday chaplin stated that there was still room for the little man in the atomic age the first of these re-releases was the chaplin revue 1959 which included new versions of a dogs life shoulder arms and the pilgrim
in america the political atmosphere began to change and attention was once again directed to chaplins films instead of his views in july 1962 the new york times published an editorial stating that we do not believe the republic would be in danger if yesterdays unforgotten little tramp were allowed to amble down the gangplank of a steamer or plane in an american port the same month chaplin was invested with the honorary degree of doctor of letters by the universities of oxford and durham in november 1963 the plaza theater in new york started a year-long series of chaplins films including monsieur verdoux and limelight which gained excellent reviews from american critics september 1964 saw the release of chaplins memoirs my autobiography which he had been working on since 1957 the 500-page book which focused on his early years and personal life became a worldwide best-seller despite criticism over the lack of information on his film career
shortly after the publication of his memoirs chaplin began work on a countess from hong kong 1967 a romantic comedy based on a script he had written for paulette goddard in the 1930s set on an ocean liner it starred marlon brando as an american ambassador and sophia loren as a stowaway found in his cabin the film differed from chaplins earlier productions in several aspects it was his first to use technicolor and the widescreen format while he concentrated on directing and appeared on-screen only in a cameo role as a seasick steward he also signed a deal with universal pictures and appointed his assistant jerome epstein as the producer chaplin was paid 600,000 directors fee as well as a percentage of the gross receipts a countess from hong kong premiered in january 1967 to unfavourable reviews and was a box-office failure chaplin was deeply hurt by the negative reaction to the film which turned out to be his last
chaplin suffered a series of minor strokes in the late 1960s which marked the beginning of a slow decline in his health despite the setbacks he was soon writing a new film script the freak a story of a winged girl found in south america which he intended as a starring vehicle for his daughter victoria his fragile health prevented the project from being realised in the early 1970s chaplin concentrated on re-releasing his old films including the kid and the circus in 1971 he was made a commander of the national order of the legion of honour at the cannes film festival the following year he was honoured with a special award by the venice film festival

in 1972 the academy of motion picture arts and sciences offered chaplin an honorary award which robinson sees as a sign that america wanted to make amends chaplin was initially hesitant about accepting but decided to return to the us for the first time in 20 years the visit attracted a large amount of press coverage and at the academy awards gala he was given a twelve-minute standing ovation the longest in the academys history visibly emotional chaplin accepted his award for the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century
although chaplin still had plans for future film projects by the mid-1970s he was very frail he experienced several further strokes which made it difficult for him to communicate and he had to use a wheelchair his final projects were compiling a pictorial autobiography my life in pictures 1974 and scoring a woman of paris for re-release in 1976 he also appeared in a documentary about his life the gentleman tramp 1975 directed by richard patterson in the 1975 new year honours chaplin was awarded a knighthood by queen elizabeth ii though he was too weak to kneel and received the honour in his wheelchair


 deathedit 

by october 1977 chaplins health had declined to the point that he needed constant care in the early morning of 25 december 1977 chaplin died at home after suffering a stroke in his sleep he was 88 years old the funeral on 27 december was a small and private anglican ceremony according to his wishes chaplin was interred in the corsier-sur-vevey cemetery among the film industrys tributes director rené clair wrote he was a monument of the cinema of all countries and all times  the most beautiful gift the cinema made to us actor bob hope declared we were lucky to have lived in his time
on 1 march 1978 chaplins coffin was dug up and stolen from its grave by two unemployed immigrants roman wardas from poland and gantcho ganev from bulgaria the body was held for ransom in an attempt to extort money from oona chaplin the pair were caught in a large police operation in may and chaplins coffin was found buried in a field in the nearby village of noville it was re-interred in the corsier cemetery surrounded by reinforced concrete


 filmmakingedit 


 influencesedit 
chaplin believed his first influence to be his mother who entertained him as a child by sitting at the window and mimicking passers-by it was through watching her that i learned not only how to express emotions with my hands and face but also how to observe and study people chaplins early years in music hall allowed him to see stage comedians at work he also attended the christmas pantomimes at drury lane where he studied the art of clowning through performers like dan leno chaplins years with the fred karno company had a formative effect on him as an actor and filmmaker simon louvish writes that the company was his training ground and it was here that chaplin learned to vary the pace of his comedy the concept of mixing pathos with slapstick was learnt from karno who also used elements of absurdity that became familiar in chaplins gags from the film industry chaplin drew upon the work of the french comedian max linder whose films he greatly admired in developing the tramp costume and persona he was likely inspired by the american vaudeville scene where tramp characters were common


 methodedit 

chaplin never spoke more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods claiming such a thing would be tantamount to a magician spoiling his own illusion little was known about his working process throughout his lifetime but research from film historians – particularly the findings of kevin brownlow and david gill that were presented in the three-part documentary unknown chaplin 1983 – has since revealed his unique working method
until he began making spoken dialogue films with the great dictator chaplin never shot from a completed script many of his early films began with only a vague premise – for example charlie enters a health spa or charlie works in a pawn shop he then had sets constructed and worked with his stock company to improvise gags and business using them almost always working the ideas out on film as ideas were accepted and discarded a narrative structure would emerge frequently requiring chaplin to reshoot an already-completed scene that might have otherwise contradicted the story from a woman of paris onward chaplin began the filming process with a prepared plot but robinson writes that every film up to modern times went through many metamorphoses and permutations before the story took its final form
producing films in this manner meant chaplin took longer to complete his pictures than almost any other filmmaker at the time if he was out of ideas he often took a break from the shoot which could last for days while keeping the studio ready for when inspiration returned delaying the process further was chaplins rigorous perfectionism according to his friend ivor montagu nothing but perfection would be right for the filmmaker because he personally funded his films chaplin was at liberty to strive for this goal and shoot as many takes as he wished the number was often excessive for instance 53 takes for every finished take in the kid for the immigrant a 20 minute-short chaplin shot 40,000 feet of film – enough for a feature-length

describing his working method as sheer perseverance to the point of madness chaplin would be completely consumed by the production of a picture robinson writes that even in chaplins later years his work continued to take precedence over everything and everyone else the combination of story improvisation and relentless perfectionism – which resulted in days of effort and thousands of feet of film being wasted all at enormous expense – often proved taxing for chaplin who in frustration would lash out at his actors and crew
chaplin exercised complete control over his pictures to the extent that he would act out the other roles for his cast expecting them to imitate him exactly he personally edited all of his films trawling through the large amounts of footage to create the exact picture he wanted as a result of his complete independence he was identified by the film historian andrew sarris as one of the first auteur filmmakers chaplin did receive help notably from his long-time cinematographer roland totheroh brother sydney chaplin and various assistant directors such as harry crocker and charles reisner


 style and themesedit 

while chaplins comedic style is broadly defined as slapstick it is considered restrained and intelligent with the film historian philip kemp describing his work as a mix of deft balletic physical comedy and thoughtful situation-based gags chaplin diverged from conventional slapstick by slowing the pace and exhausting each scene of its comic potential with more focus on developing the viewers relationship to the characters unlike conventional slapstick comedies robinson states that the comic moments in chaplins films centre on the tramps attitude to the things happening to him the humour does not come from the tramp bumping into a tree but from his lifting his hat to the tree in apology dan kamin writes that chaplins quirky mannerisms and serious demeanour in the midst of slapstick action are other key aspects of his comedy while the surreal transformation of objects and the employment of in-camera trickery are also common features
chaplins silent films typically follow the tramps efforts to survive in a hostile world the character lives in poverty and is frequently treated badly but remains kind and upbeat defying his social position he strives to be seen as a gentleman as chaplin said in 1925 the whole point of the little fellow is that no matter how down on his ass he is no matter how well the jackals succeed in tearing him apart hes still a man of dignity the tramp defies authority figures and gives as good as he gets leading robinson and louvish to see him as a representative for the underprivileged – an everyman turned heroic saviour hansmeyer notes that several of chaplins films end with the homeless and lonely tramp walking optimistically  into the sunset  to continue his journey

the infusion of pathos is a well-known aspect of chaplins work and larcher notes his reputation for inducing laughter and tears sentimentality in his films comes from a variety of sources with louvish pinpointing personal failure societys strictures economic disaster and the elements chaplin sometimes drew on tragic events when creating his films as in the case of the gold rush 1925 which was inspired by the fate of the donner party constance b kuriyama has identified serious underlying themes in the early comedies such as greed the gold rush and loss the kid chaplin also touched on controversial issues immigration the immigrant 1917 illegitimacy the kid 1921 and drug use easy street 1917 he often explored these topics ironically making comedy out of suffering
social commentary was a feature of chaplins films from early in his career as he portrayed the underdog in a sympathetic light and highlighted the difficulties of the poor later as he developed a keen interest in economics and felt obliged to publicise his views chaplin began incorporating overtly political messages into his films modern times 1936 depicted factory workers in dismal conditions the great dictator 1940 parodied adolf hitler and benito mussolini and ended in a speech against nationalism monsieur verdoux 1947 criticised war and capitalism and a king in new york 1957 attacked mccarthyism
several of chaplins films incorporate autobiographical elements and the psychologist sigmund freud believed that chaplin always plays only himself as he was in his dismal youth the kid is thought to reflect chaplins childhood trauma of being sent into an orphanage the main characters in limelight 1952 contain elements from the lives of his parents and a king in new york references chaplins experiences of being shunned by the united states many of his sets especially in street scenes bear a strong similarity to kennington where he grew up stephen m weissman has argued that chaplins problematic relationship with his mentally ill mother was often reflected in his female characters and the tramps desire to save them
regarding the structure of chaplins films the scholar gerald mast sees them as consisting of sketches tied together by the same theme and setting rather than having a tightly unified storyline visually his films are simple and economic with scenes portrayed as if set on a stage his approach to filming was described by the art director eugène lourié chaplin did not think in artistic images when he was shooting he believed that action is the main thing the camera is there to photograph the actors in his autobiography chaplin wrote simplicity is best  pompous effects slow up action are boring and unpleasant  the camera should not intrude this approach has prompted criticism since the 1940s for being old fashioned while the film scholar donald mccaffrey sees it as an indication that chaplin never completely understood film as a medium kamin however comments that chaplins comedic talent would not be enough to remain funny on screen if he did not have an ability to conceive and direct scenes specifically for the film medium


 composingedit 

chaplin developed a passion for music as a child and taught himself to play the piano violin and cello he considered the musical accompaniment of a film to be important and from a woman of paris onwards he took an increasing interest in this area with the advent of sound technology chaplin began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack – composed by himself – for city lights 1931 he thereafter composed the scores for all of his films and from the late 1950s to his death he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films
as chaplin was not a trained musician he could not read sheet music and needed the help of professional composers such as david raksin raymond rasch and eric james when creating his scores musical directors were employed to oversee the recording process such as alfred newman for city lights although some critics have claimed that credit for his film music should be given to the composers who worked with him raksin – who worked with chaplin on modern times – stressed chaplins creative position and active participation in the composing process this process which could take months would start with chaplin describing to the composers exactly what he wanted and singing or playing tunes he had improvised on the piano these tunes were then developed further in a close collaboration among the composers and chaplin according to film historian jeffrey vance although he relied upon associates to arrange varied and complex instrumentation the musical imperative is his and not a note in a chaplin musical score was placed there without his assent
chaplins compositions produced three popular songs smile composed originally for modern times 1936 and later set to lyrics by john turner and geoffrey parsons was a hit for nat king cole in 1954 for limelight chaplin composed terrys theme which was popularised by jimmy young as eternally 1952 finally this is my song performed by petula clark for a countess from hong kong 1967 reached number one on the uk and other european charts chaplin also received his only competitive oscar for his composition work as the limelight theme won an academy award for best original score in 1973 following the films re-release


 legacyedit 

in 1998 the film critic andrew sarris called chaplin arguably the single most important artist produced by the cinema certainly its most extraordinary performer and probably still its most universal icon he is described by the british film institute as a towering figure in world culture and was included in time magazines list of the 100 most important people of the 20th century for the laughter he brought to millions and because he more or less invented global recognizability and helped turn an industry into an art
the image of the tramp has become a part of cultural history according to simon louvish the character is recognisable to people who have never seen a chaplin film and in places where his films are never shown the critic leonard maltin has written of the unique and indelible nature of the tramp and argued that no other comedian matched his worldwide impact praising the character richard schickel suggests that chaplins films with the tramp contain the most eloquent richly comedic expressions of the human spirit in movie history memorabilia connected to the character still fetches large sums in auctions in 2006 a bowler hat and a bamboo cane that were part of the tramps costume were bought for 140,000 in a los angeles auction
as a filmmaker chaplin is considered a pioneer and one of the most influential figures of the early twentieth century he is often credited as one of the mediums first artists film historian mark cousins has written that chaplin changed not only the imagery of cinema but also its sociology and grammar and claims that chaplin was as important to the development of comedy as a genre as dw griffith was to drama he was the first to popularise feature-length comedy and to slow down the pace of action adding pathos and subtlety to it although his work is mostly classified as slapstick chaplins drama a woman of paris 1923 was a major influence on ernst lubitschs film the marriage circle 1924 and thus played a part in the development of sophisticated comedy according to david robinson chaplins innovations were rapidly assimilated to become part of the common practice of film craft filmmakers who cited chaplin as an influence include federico fellini who called chaplin a sort of adam from whom we are all descended jacques tati without him i would never have made a film rené clair he inspired practically every filmmaker michael powell billy wilder vittorio de sica and richard attenborough russian filmmaker andrei tarkovsky praised chaplin as the only person to have gone down into cinematic history without any shadow of a doubt the films he left behind can never grow old
chaplin also strongly influenced the work of later comedians marcel marceau said he was inspired to become a mime artist after watching chaplin while the actor raj kapoor based his screen persona on the tramp mark cousins has also detected chaplins comedic style in the french character monsieur hulot and the italian character totò in other fields chaplin helped inspire the cartoon characters felix the cat and mickey mouse and was an influence on the dada art movement as one of the founding members of united artists chaplin also had a role in the development of the film industry gerald mast has written that although ua never became a major company like mgm or paramount pictures the idea that directors could produce their own films was years ahead of its time
in the 21st century several of chaplins films are still regarded as classics and among the greatest ever made the 2012 sight  sound poll which compiles top ten ballots from film critics and directors to determine each groups most acclaimed films saw city lights rank among the critics top 50 modern times inside the top 100 and the great dictator and the gold rush placed in the top 250 the top 100 films as voted on by directors included modern times at number 22 city lights at number 30 and the gold rush at number 91 every one of chaplins features received a vote in 2007 the american film institute named city lights the 11th greatest american film of all time while the gold rush and modern times again ranked in the top 100 books about chaplin continue to be published regularly and he is a popular subject for media scholars and film archivists many of chaplins film have had a dvd and blu-ray release
