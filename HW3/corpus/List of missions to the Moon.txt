as part of human exploration of the moon numerous space missions have been undertaken to study earths natural satellite of the moon landings luna 2 was the first spacecraft to reach its surface successfully intentionally impacting the moon on 13 september 1959 in 1966 luna 9 became the first spacecraft to achieve a controlled soft landing while luna 10 became the first mission to enter orbit
