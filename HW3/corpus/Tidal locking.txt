tidal locking also called gravitational locking or captured rotation occurs when the long-term interaction between a pair of co-orbiting astronomical bodies drives the rotation rates into a harmonic ratio with the orbital period this effect arises from the gravitational gradient tidal force between the co-orbiting bodies acting over a sufficiently long period of time once tidal locking is achieved for one of the bodies there is no more net transfer of angular momentum between the two objects although there can be some back and forth transfer over the course of an orbit in the special case where the orbital eccentricity is nearly zero tidal locking results in one hemisphere of the revolving object constantly facing its partner an effect known as synchronous rotation for example the same side of the moon always faces the earth although there is some libration because the moons orbit is not perfectly circular a tidally locked body in synchronous rotation takes just as long to rotate around its own axis as it does to revolve around its partner
usually only the satellite is tidally locked to the larger body however if both the mass difference between the two bodies and the distance between them are relatively small each may be tidally locked to the other this is the case for pluto and charon
this effect is employed to stabilize some artificial satellites
one form of hypothetical tidal locked planets are eyeball planets that in turn are divided into hot and cold eyeball planets


 mechanism 

consider a pair of co-orbiting objects a and b the change in rotation rate necessary to tidally lock body b to the larger body a is caused by the torque applied by as gravity on bulges it has induced on b by tidal forces
the gravitational force from object a upon b will vary with distance being greatest at the nearest surface to a and least at the most distant this creates a gravitational gradient across object b that will distort its equilibrium shape slightly the body of object b will become elongated along the axis oriented toward a and conversely slightly reduced in dimension in directions orthogonal to this axis the elongated distortions are known as tidal bulges for the solid earth these bulges can reach displacements of up to around 0.4 metres 1.3 ft when b is not yet tidally locked the bulges travel over its surface due to orbital motions with one of the two high tidal bulges traveling close to the point where body a is overhead for large astronomical bodies that are nearly spherical due to self-gravitation the tidal distortion produces a slightly prolate spheroid ie an axially symmetric ellipsoid that is elongated along its major axis smaller bodies also experience distortion but this distortion is less regular
the material of b exerts resistance to this periodic reshaping caused by the tidal force in effect some time is required to reshape b to the gravitational equilibrium shape by which time the forming bulges have already been carried some distance away from the a–b axis by bs rotation seen from a vantage point in space the points of maximum bulge extension are displaced from the axis oriented toward a if bs rotation period is shorter than its orbital period the bulges are carried forward of the axis oriented toward a in the direction of rotation whereas if bs rotation period is longer the bulges instead lag behind
because the bulges are now displaced from the a–b axis as gravitational pull on the mass in them exerts a torque on b the torque on the a-facing bulge acts to bring bs rotation in line with its orbital period whereas the back bulge which faces away from a acts in the opposite sense however the bulge on the a-facing side is closer to a than the back bulge by a distance of approximately bs diameter and so experiences a slightly stronger gravitational force and torque the net resulting torque from both bulges then is always in the direction that acts to synchronize bs rotation with its orbital period leading eventually to tidal locking


 orbital changes 

the angular momentum of the whole a–b system is conserved in this process so that when b slows down and loses rotational angular momentum its orbital angular momentum is boosted by a similar amount there are also some smaller effects on as rotation this results in a raising of bs orbit about a in tandem with its rotational slowdown for the other case where b starts off rotating too slowly tidal locking both speeds up its rotation and lowers its orbit


 locking of the larger body 

the tidal locking effect is also experienced by the larger body a but at a slower rate because bs gravitational effect is weaker due to bs smaller mass for example earths rotation is gradually being slowed by the moon by an amount that becomes noticeable over geological time as revealed in the fossil record current estimations are that this together with the tidal influence of the sun has helped lengthen the earth day from about 6 hours to the current 24 hours currently atomic clocks show that earths day lengthens by about 15 microseconds every year given enough time this would create a mutual tidal locking between earth and the moon where the length of a day has increased and the length of a lunar month has shortened until the two are the same however earth is not expected to become tidally locked to the moon before the sun becomes a red giant and engulfs earth and the moon
for bodies of similar size the effect may be of comparable size for both and both may become tidally locked to each other on a much shorter timescale an example is the dwarf planet pluto and its satellite charon they have already reached a state where charon is only visible from one hemisphere of pluto and vice versa


 rotation–orbit resonance 
finally in some cases where the orbit is eccentric and the tidal effect is relatively weak the smaller body may end up in a so-called spin-orbit resonance rather than being tidally locked here the ratio of the rotation period of a body to its own orbital period is some simple fraction different from 11 a well known case is the rotation of mercury which is locked to its own orbit around the sun in a 32 resonance
many exoplanets especially the close-in ones are expected to be in spin–orbit resonances higher than 11 a mercury-like terrestrial planet can for example become captured in a 32 21 or 52 spin-orbit resonance with the probability of each being dependent on the orbital eccentricity


 occurrence 


 moons 

most major moons in the solar system − the gravitationally rounded satellites − are tidally locked with their primaries because they orbit very closely and tidal force increases rapidly as a cubic function with decreasing distance notable exceptions are the irregular outer satellites of the gas giants which orbit much farther away than the large well-known moons
pluto and charon are an extreme example of a tidal lock charon is a relatively large moon in comparison to its primary and also has a very close orbit this results in pluto and charon being mutually tidally locked plutos other moons are not tidally locked styx nix kerberos and hydra all rotate chaotically due to the influence of charon
the tidal locking situation for asteroid moons is largely unknown but closely orbiting binaries are expected to be tidally locked as well as contact binaries


 the moon 

the moons rotation and orbital periods are tidally locked with each other so no matter when the moon is observed from earth the same hemisphere of the moon is always seen the far side of the moon was not seen until 1959 when photographs of most of the far side were transmitted from the soviet spacecraft luna 3
when the earth is observed from the moon the earth does not appear to translate across the sky but appears to remain in the same place rotating on its own axis
despite the moons rotational and orbital periods being exactly locked about 59% of the moons total surface may be seen with repeated observations from earth due to the phenomena of libration and parallax librations are primarily caused by the moons varying orbital speed due to the eccentricity of its orbit this allows up to about 6° more along its perimeter to be seen from earth parallax is a geometric effect at the surface of earth we are offset from the line through the centers of earth and moon and because of this we can observe a bit about 1° more around the side of the moon when it is on our local horizon


 planets 
it was thought for some time that mercury was in synchronous rotation with the sun this was because whenever mercury was best placed for observation the same side faced inward radar observations in 1965 demonstrated instead that mercury has a 32 spin–orbit resonance rotating three times for every two revolutions around the sun which results in the same positioning at those observation points modeling has demonstrated that mercury was captured into the 32 spin–orbit state very early in its history within 20 and more likely even 10 million years after its formation
venuss 583.92-day interval between successive close approaches to earth is equal to 5.001444 venusian solar days making approximately the same face visible from earth at each close approach whether this relationship arose by chance or is the result of some kind of tidal locking with earth is unknown
proxima centauri b the earth-like planet discovered in 2016 that orbits around the star proxima centauri is tidally locked either in synchronized rotation or otherwise expresses a 32 spin-orbit resonance like that of mercury


 stars 
close binary stars throughout the universe are expected to be tidally locked with each other and extrasolar planets that have been found to orbit their primaries extremely closely are also thought to be tidally locked to them an unusual example confirmed by most may be tau boötis a star that is probably tidally locked by a planet if so the tidal locking is almost certainly mutual however since stars are gaseous bodies that can rotate with a different rate at different latitudes the tidal lock is with τ boötis magnetic field
