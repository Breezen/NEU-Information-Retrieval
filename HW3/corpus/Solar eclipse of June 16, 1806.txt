 observations 

it has been called tecumsehs eclipse after the shawnee chief tecumseh realized that the only hope for the various tribes in east and central north america was to join together he was assisted by his brother-tenskwatawa -a prophet who called for a rejection of the white ways and a return to traditional values tenskwatawa was ready for tecumseh and had learned from explorers that a total solar eclipse was to occur tecumseh ordered the great spirit to release the sun
josé joaquín de ferrer observed from kinderhook new york and gave the name corona to the glow of the faint outer atmosphere of the sun seen during a total eclipse he proposes that the corona must belong to the sun not the moon because of its great size ferrer also states that during the total eclipse of 1806 the irregularities of the moons surface were plainly discernible
