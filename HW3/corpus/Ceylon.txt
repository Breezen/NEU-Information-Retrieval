 history 


 prehistory 

the pre-history of sri lanka goes back 125,000 years and possibly even as far back as 500,000 years the era spans the palaeolithic mesolithic and early iron ages among the paleolithic human settlements discovered in sri lanka pahiyangala named after the chinese traveller monk faxian which dates back to 37,000 bp batadombalena 28,500 bp and belilena 12,000 bp are the most important in these caves archaeologists have found the remains of anatomically modern humans which they have named balangoda man and other evidence suggesting that they may have engaged in agriculture and kept domestic dogs for driving game
one of the first written references to the island is found in the indian epic ramayana which provides details of a kingdom named lanka that was created by the divine sculptor vishwakarma for kubera the lord of wealth it is said that kubera was overthrown by his demon stepbrother ravana the powerful emperor who built a mythical flying machine named dandu monara the modern city of wariyapola is described as ravanas airport
early inhabitants of sri lanka were probably ancestors of the vedda people an indigenous people numbering approximately 2,500 living in modern-day sri lanka the 19th-century irish historian james emerson tennent theorized that galle a city in southern sri lanka was the ancient seaport of tarshish from which king solomon is said to have drawn ivory peacocks and other valuables


 pre-anuradhapura period 

according to the mahāvamsa a chronicle written in pāḷi the original inhabitants of sri lanka are the yakshas and nagas ancient cemeteries that were used before 600 bc and other signs of advanced civilization has also been discovered in sri lanka sinhalese history traditionally starts in 543 bc with the arrival of prince vijaya a semi-legendary prince who sailed with 700 followers to sri lanka after being expelled from vanga kingdom present-day bengal he established the kingdom of tambapanni near modern-day mannar vijaya singha is the first of the approximately 189 native monarchs of sri lanka described in chronicles such as the dipavamsa mahāvaṃsa cūḷavaṃsa and rājāvaliya see list of sinhalese monarchs sri lankan dynastic history ended in 1815 when the island became part of the british empire


 anuradhapura period 

the anuradhapura kingdom was established in 380 bc during the reign of pandukabhaya of anuradhapura thereafter anuradhapura served as the capital city of the country for nearly 1,400 years ancient sri lankans excelled at building certain types of structures constructions such as tanks dagobas and palaces society underwent a major transformation during the reign of devanampiya tissa of anuradhapura with the arrival of buddhism from india in 250 bc mahinda the son of the mauryan emperor ashoka and a bhikkhu buddhist monk arrived in mihintale carrying the message of buddhism his mission won over the monarch who embraced the faith and propagated it throughout the sinhalese population
succeeding kingdoms of sri lanka would maintain a large number of buddhist schools and monasteries and support the propagation of buddhism into other countries in southeast asia sri lankan bhikkhus studied in indias famous ancient buddhist university of nalanda which was destroyed by bakhtiyar khilji it is probable that many of the scriptures from nalanda are preserved in sri lankas many monasteries and that the written form of the tipitaka including sinhalese buddhist literature were part of the university of nalanda in 245 bc bhikkhuni sangamitta arrived with the jaya sri maha bodhi tree which is considered to be a sapling from the historical bodhi tree under which gautama buddha became enlightened it is considered the oldest human-planted tree with a continuous historical record in the world bodhivamsa
invasions
sri lanka first experienced a foreign invasion during the reign of suratissa who was defeated by two horse traders named sena and guttika from south india the next invasion came immediately in 205 bc by a chola king named ellalan who overthrew asela and ruled the country for 44 years dutugemunu the eldest son of the southern regional sub-king kavan tissa defeated elara in the battle of vijithapura he built ruwanwelisaya the second stupa in ancient sri lanka and the lovamahapaya
during its two and a half millennia of existence the kingdom of sri lanka was invaded at least eight times by neighbouring south asian dynasties such as the chola pandya chera and pallava these invaders were all subsequently driven back there also were incursions by the kingdoms of kalinga modern odisha and from the malay peninsula as well kala wewa and the avukana buddha statue were built during the reign of dhatusena
fourth buddhist council

the fourth buddhist council of theravada buddhism was held at the anuradhapura maha viharaya in sri lanka under the patronage of valagamba of anuradhapura in 25 bc the council was held in response to a year in which the harvests in sri lanka were particularly poor and many buddhist monks subsequently died of starvation because the pāli canon was at that time oral literature maintained in several recensions by dhammabhāṇakas dharma reciters the surviving monks recognized the danger of not writing it down so that even if some of the monks whose duty it was to study and remember parts of the canon for later generations died the teachings would not be lost
after the council palm-leaf manuscripts containing the completed canon were taken to other countries such as burma thailand cambodia and laos
later periods

sri lanka was the first asian country known to have a female ruler anula of anuradhapura r 47–42 bc sri lankan monarchs undertook some remarkable construction projects such as sigiriya the so-called fortress in the sky built during the reign of kashyapa i of anuradhapura who ruled between 477 and 495 the sigiriya rock fortress is surrounded by an extensive network of ramparts and moats inside this protective enclosure were gardens ponds pavilions palaces and other structures
the 1,600-year-old sigiriya frescoes are an example of ancient sri lankan art at its finest they are one of the best preserved examples of ancient urban planning in the world they have been declared by unesco as one of the seven world heritage sites in sri lanka among other structures large reservoirs important for conserving water in a climate with rainy and dry seasons and elaborate aqueducts some with a slope as finely calibrated as one inch to the mile are most notable biso kotuwa a peculiar construction inside a dam is a technological marvel based on precise mathematics that allows water to flow outside the dam keeping pressure on the dam to a minimum
ancient sri lanka was the first country in the world to establish a dedicated hospital in mihintale in the 4th century it was also the leading exporter of cinnamon in the ancient world it maintained close ties with european civilisations including the roman empire for example bhatikabhaya 22 bc – ad 7 sent an envoy to rome who brought back red coral which was used to make an elaborate netlike adornment for the ruwanwelisaya in addition sri lankan male dancers witnessed the assassination of caligula when queen cleopatra sent her son caesarion into hiding he was headed to sri lanka
the upasampada for bhikkhunis buddhist nuns first arrived in china when devasāra and ten other bhikkhunis came from sri lanka at the request of chinese women and established the order there in 429


 polonnaruwa and transitional periods 

the medieval period of sri lanka begins with the fall of anuradhapura kingdom in ad 993 the invasion of chola emperor rajaraja i forced the then sri lankan ruler mahinda v to flee to the southern part of sri lanka taking advantage of this situation rajendra i son of rajaraja i launched a large invasion in 1017 mahinda v was captured and taken to india and the cholas sacked the city of anuradhapura subsequently they moved the capital to polonnaruwa
this marked the end of the two great dynasties of ancient sri lanka the moriya and the lambakanna following a seventeen-year-long campaign vijayabahu i successfully drove the chola out of sri lanka in 1070 reuniting the country for the first time in over a century upon his request ordained monks were sent from burma to sri lanka to re-establish buddhism which had almost disappeared from the country during the chola reign during the medieval period sri lanka was divided into three sub-territories namely ruhunu pihiti and maya

sri lankas irrigation system was extensively expanded during the reign of parākramabāhu the great 1153–1186 this period is considered as a time when sri lanka was at the height of its power he built 1470 reservoirs – the highest number by any ruler in sri lankas history – repaired 165 dams 3910 canals 163 major reservoirs and 2376 mini-reservoirs his most famous construction is the parakrama samudra the largest irrigation project of medieval sri lanka parākramabāhus reign is memorable for two major campaigns – in the south of india as part of a pandyan war of succession and a punitive strike against the kings of ramanna myanmar for various perceived insults to sri lanka
after his demise sri lanka gradually decayed in power in 1215 kalinga magha a south indian with uncertain origins identified as the founder of the jaffna kingdom invaded and captured the kingdom of polonnaruwa he sailed from kalinga 690 nautical miles on 100 large ships with a 24,000 strong army unlike previous invaders he looted ransacked and destroyed everything in the ancient anuradhapura and polonnaruwa kingdoms beyond recovery his priorities in ruling were to extract as much as possible from the land and overturn as many of the traditions of rajarata as possible his reign saw the massive migration of native sinhalese people to the south and west of sri lanka and into the mountainous interior in a bid to escape his power
sri lanka never really recovered from the impact of kalinga maghas invasion king vijayabâhu iii who led the resistance brought the kingdom to dambadeniya the north in the meanwhile eventually evolved into the jaffna kingdom the jaffna kingdom never came under the rule of any kingdom of the south except on one occasion in 1450 following the conquest led by king parâkramabâhu vis adopted son prince sapumal he ruled the north from ad 1450 to 1467
the next three centuries starting from 1215 were marked by kaleidoscopically shifting collections of kingdoms in south and central sri lanka including dambadeniya yapahuwa gampola raigama kotte sitawaka and finally kandy chinese admiral zheng he and his naval expeditionary force landed at galle sri lanka in 1409 and got into battle with the local king vira alakesvara of gampola zheng he captured king vira alakesvara and later released him zheng he erected the galle trilingual inscription a stone tablet at galle written in three languages chinese tamil and persian to commemorate his visit the stele was discovered by s h thomlin at galle in 1911 and is now preserved in the colombo national museum


 kandyan period 

the early modern period of sri lanka begins with the arrival of portuguese soldier and explorer lourenço de almeida the son of francisco de almeida in 1505 in 1517 the portuguese built a fort at the port city of colombo and gradually extended their control over the coastal areas in 1592 after decades of intermittent warfare with the portuguese vimaladharmasuriya i moved his kingdom to the inland city of kandy a location he thought more secure from attack in 1619 succumbing to attacks by the portuguese the independent existence of jaffna kingdom came to an end
during the reign of the rajasinghe ii dutch explorers arrived on the island in 1638 the king signed a treaty with the dutch east india company to get rid of the portuguese who ruled most of the coastal areas the following dutch–portuguese war resulted in a dutch victory with colombo falling into dutch hands by 1656 the dutch remained in the areas they had captured thereby violating the treaty they had signed in 1638 an ethnic group named burgher people emerged in sri lankan society as a result of dutch rule
the kingdom of kandy was the last independent monarchy of sri lanka in 1595 vimaladharmasurya brought the sacred tooth relic – the traditional symbol of royal and religious authority amongst the sinhalese – to kandy and built the temple of the tooth in spite of on-going intermittent warfare with europeans the kingdom survived later a crisis of succession emerged in kandy upon king vira narendrasinhas death in 1739 he was married to a telugu-speaking nayakkar princess from south india madurai and was childless by her
eventually with the support of bhikku weliwita sarankara the crown passed to the brother of one of narendrasinhas princesses overlooking the right of unambuwe bandara narendrasinhas own son by a sinhalese concubine the new king was crowned sri vijaya rajasinha later that year kings of the nayakkar dynasty launched several attacks on dutch controlled areas which proved to be unsuccessful


 british rule 

during the napoleonic wars fearing that french control of the netherlands might deliver sri lanka to the french great britain occupied the coastal areas of the island which they called ceylon with little difficulty in 1796 two years later in 1798 sri rajadhi rajasinha third of the four nayakkar kings of sri lanka died of a fever following his death a nephew of rajadhi rajasinha eighteen-year-old kannasamy was crowned the young king now named sri vikrama rajasinha faced a british invasion in 1803 but successfully retaliated
by then the entire coastal area was under the british east india company as a result of the treaty of amiens on 14 february 1815 kandy was occupied by the british in the second kandyan war ending sri lankas independence sri vikrama rajasinha the last native monarch of sri lanka was exiled to india the kandyan convention formally ceded the entire country to the british empire attempts by sri lankan noblemen to undermine british power in 1818 during the uva rebellion were thwarted by governor robert brownrigg
the beginning of the modern period of sri lanka is marked by the colebrooke-cameron reforms of 1833 they introduced a utilitarian and liberal political culture to the country based on the rule of law and amalgamated the kandyan and maritime provinces as a single unit of government an executive council and a legislative council were established later becoming the foundation of a representative legislature by this time experiments with coffee plantations were largely successful
soon coffee became the primary commodity export of sri lanka falling coffee prices as a result of the depression of 1847 stalled economic development and prompted the governor to introduce a series of taxes on firearms dogs shops boats etc and to reintroduce a form of rajakariya requiring six days free labour on roads or payment of a cash equivalent these harsh measures antagonised the locals and another rebellion broke out in 1848 a devastating leaf disease hemileia vastatrix struck the coffee plantations in 1869 destroying the entire industry within fifteen years the british quickly found a replacement abandoning coffee they began cultivating tea instead tea production in sri lanka thrived in the following decades large-scale rubber plantations began in the early 20th century

by the end of the 19th century a new educated social class transcending race and caste arose through british attempts to staff the ceylon civil service and the legal educational and medical professions new leaders represented the various ethnic groups of the population in the ceylon legislative council on a communal basis buddhist and hindu revivalism reacted against christian missionary activities the first two decades in the 20th century are noted by the unique harmony among sinhalese and tamil political leadership which has since been lost
in 1919 major sinhalese and tamil political organisations united to form the ceylon national congress under the leadership of ponnambalam arunachalam pressing colonial masters for more constitutional reforms but without massive popular support and with the governors encouragement for communal representation by creating a colombo seat that dangled between sinhalese and tamils the congress lost momentum towards the mid-1920s
the donoughmore reforms of 1931 repudiated the communal representation and introduced universal adult franchise the franchise stood at 4% before the reforms this step was strongly criticised by the tamil political leadership who realised that they would be reduced to a minority in the newly created state council of ceylon which succeeded the legislative council in 1937 tamil leader g g ponnambalam demanded a 50–50 representation 50% for the sinhalese and 50% for other ethnic groups in the state council however this demand was not met by the soulbury reforms of 1944–45


 modern sri lanka 

the soulbury constitution ushered in dominion status with independence proclaimed on 4 february 1948 d s senanayake became the first prime minister of ceylon prominent tamil leaders including ponnambalam and arunachalam mahadeva joined his cabinet the british royal navy remained stationed at trincomalee until 1956 a countrywide popular demonstration against withdrawal of the rice ration known as hartal 1953 resulted in the resignation of prime minister dudley senanayake
s w r d bandaranaike was elected prime minister in 1956 his three-year rule had a profound impact through his self-proclaimed role of defender of the besieged sinhalese culture he introduced the controversial sinhala only act recognising sinhala as the only official language of the government although partially reversed in 1958 the bill posed a grave concern for the tamil community which perceived in it a threat to their language and culture
the federal party fp launched a movement of non-violent resistance satyagraha against the bill which prompted bandaranaike to reach an agreement bandaranaike–chelvanayakam pact with s j v chelvanayakam leader of the fp to resolve the looming ethnic conflict the pact proved ineffective in the face of ongoing protests by opposition and the buddhist clergy the bill together with various government colonisation schemes contributed much towards the political rancour between sinhalese and tamil political leaders bandaranaike was assassinated by an extremist buddhist monk in 1959
sirimavo bandaranaike the widow of bandaranaike took office as prime minister in 1960 and withstood an attempted coup détat in 1962 during her second term as prime minister the government instituted socialist economic polices strengthening ties with the soviet union and china while promoting a policy of non-alignment in 1971 ceylon experienced a marxist insurrection which was quickly suppressed in 1972 the country became a republic named sri lanka repudiating its dominion status prolonged minority grievances and the use of communal emotionalism as an election campaign weapon by both sinhalese and tamil leaders abetted a fledgling tamil militancy in the north during the 1970s the policy of standardisation by the sirimavo government to rectify disparities created in university enrolment which was in essence an affirmative action to assist geographically disadvantaged students to obtain tertiary education resulted in reducing the proportion of tamil students at university level and acted as the immediate catalyst for the rise of militancy the assassination of jaffna mayor alfred duraiyappah in 1975 by the liberation tigers of tamil eelam ltte marked a crisis point

the government of j r jayawardene swept to power in 1977 defeating the largely unpopular united front government jayawardene introduced a new constitution together with a free-market economy and a powerful executive presidency modelled after that of france it made sri lanka the first south asian country to liberalise its economy beginning in 1983 ethnic tensions were manifested in an on-and-off insurgency against the government by the ltte an ltte attack on 13 soldiers resulted in the anti-tamil race riots in july 1983 allegedly backed by sinhalese hard-line ministers which resulted in more than 150,000 tamil civilians fleeing the island seeking asylum in other countries
lapses in foreign policy resulted in india strengthening the tigers by providing arms and training in 1987 the indo-sri lanka accord was signed and the indian peace keeping force ipkf was deployed in northern sri lanka to stabilise the region by neutralising the ltte the same year the jvp launched its second insurrection in southern sri lanka necessitating redeployment of the ipkf in 1990 in october 1990 the ltte expelled sri lankan moors muslims by religion from northern sri lanka in 2002 the sri lankan government and ltte signed a norwegian-mediated ceasefire agreement

the 2004 asian tsunami killed over 35,000 in sri lanka from 1985 to 2006 the sri lankan government and tamil insurgents held four rounds of peace talks without success both ltte and the government resumed fighting in 2006 and the government officially backed out of the ceasefire in 2008 in 2009 under the presidency of mahinda rajapaksa the sri lanka armed forces defeated the ltte and re-established control of the entire country by the sri lankan government overall between 60,000 and 100,000 people were killed during the 26 years of conflict
forty thousand tamil civilians may have been killed in the final phases of the sri lankan civil war according to an expert panel convened by un secretary general ban ki-moon the exact number of tamils killed is still a speculation that needs further study following the lttes defeat the tamil national alliance the largest tamil political party in sri lanka dropped its demand for a separate state in favour of a federal solution the final stages of the war left some 294,000 people displaced
according to the ministry of resettlement most of the displaced persons had been released or returned to their places of origin leaving only 6,651 in the camps as of december 2011 in may 2010 president rajapaksa appointed the lessons learnt and reconciliation commission llrc to assess the conflict between the time of the ceasefire agreement in 2002 and the defeat of the ltte in 2009 sri lanka has emerged from its 26-year war to become one of the fastest growing economies of the world

during sri lankas 68th national independence day celebrations on 4 february 2016 the tamil version of the national anthem sri lanka matha was sung for the first time since 1949 at an official government event the independence day celebrations lifting of the unofficial ban on the tamil version had been approved by president maithripala sirisena who had said he would unite the nation after the nearly 26-year civil war that ended in 2009 and by others in the government this step was viewed as part of the plan for reconciliation other steps are also being taken to mend ethnic divisions between the sinhalese majority and the tamil minority according to a november 2016 article in national geographic sri lanka matha was also sung in the majority sinhalese some groups and sri lankas former president mahinda rajapaksa were opposed to the government officially allowing the tamil version to be sung


 geography 

sri lanka lies on the indian plate a major tectonic plate that was formerly part of the indo-australian plate it is in the indian ocean southwest of the bay of bengal between latitudes 5° and 10°n and longitudes 79° and 82°e sri lanka is separated from the mainland portion of the indian subcontinent by the gulf of mannar and palk strait according to hindu mythology a land bridge existed between the indian mainland and sri lanka it now amounts to only a chain of limestone shoals remaining above sea level legends claim that it was passable on foot up to 1480 ad until cyclones deepened the channel portions are still as shallow as 1 metre 3 ft hindering navigation the island consists mostly of flat to rolling coastal plains with mountains rising only in the south-central part the highest point is pidurutalagala reaching 2,524 metres 8,281 ft above sea level

sri lanka has 103 rivers the longest of these is the mahaweli river extending 335 kilometres 208 mi these waterways give rise to 51 natural waterfalls of 10 meters or more the highest is bambarakanda falls with a height of 263 metres 863 ft sri lankas coastline is 1,585 km long sri lanka claims an exclusive economic zone eez extending 200 nautical miles which is approximately 6.7 times sri lankas land area the coastline and adjacent waters support highly productive marine ecosystems such as fringing coral reefs and shallow beds of coastal and estuarine seagrasses
sri lanka has 45 estuaries and 40 lagoons sri lankas mangrove ecosystem spans over 7,000 hectares and played a vital role in buffering the force of the waves in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami the island is rich in minerals such as ilmenite feldspar graphite silica kaolin mica and thorium existence of petroleum and gas in the gulf of mannar has also been confirmed and the extraction of recoverable quantities is underway


 climate 

the climate is tropical and warm due to the moderating effects of ocean winds mean temperatures range from 17 °c 62.6 °f in the central highlands where frost may occur for several days in the winter to a maximum of 33 °c 91.4 °f in other low-altitude areas average yearly temperatures range from 28 °c 82.4 °f to nearly 31 °c 87.8 °f day and night temperatures may vary by 14 °c 25.2 °f to 18 °c 32.4 °f
rainfall pattern is influenced by monsoon winds from the indian ocean and bay of bengal the wet zone and some of the windward slopes of the central highlands receive up to 2,500 millimetres 98.4 in of rain each year but the leeward slopes in the east and northeast receive little rain most of the east southeast and northern parts of sri lanka comprise the dry zone which receives between 1,200 and 1,900 mm 47 and 75 in of rain annually
the arid northwest and southeast coasts receive the least amount of rain at 800 to 1,200 mm 31 to 47 in per year periodic squalls occur and sometimes tropical cyclones bring overcast skies and rains to the southwest northeast and eastern parts of the island humidity is typically higher in the southwest and mountainous areas and depends on the seasonal patterns of rainfall
an increase in average rainfall coupled with heavier rainfall events has resulted in recurrent flooding and related damages to infrastructure utility supply and the urban economy


 flora and fauna 

lying within the indomalaya ecozone sri lanka is one of 25 biodiversity hotspots in the world although the country is relatively small in size it has the highest biodiversity density in asia a remarkably high proportion of the species among its flora and fauna 27% of the 3,210 flowering plants and 22% of the mammals see list are endemic sri lanka has declared 24 wildlife reserves which are home to a wide range of native species such as asian elephants leopards sloth bears the unique small loris a variety of deer the purple-faced langur the endangered wild boar porcupines and indian pangolins
flowering acacias flourish on the arid jaffna peninsula among the trees of the dry-land forests are valuable species such as satinwood ebony ironwood mahogany and teak the wet zone is a tropical evergreen forest with tall trees broad foliage and a dense undergrowth of vines and creepers subtropical evergreen forests resembling those of temperate climates flourish in the higher altitudes

yala national park in the southeast protects herds of elephant deer and peacocks the wilpattu national park in the northwest the largest national park preserves the habitats of many water birds such as storks pelicans ibis and spoonbills the island has four biosphere reserves bundala hurulu forest reserve the kanneliya-dediyagala-nakiyadeniya and sinharaja of these sinharaja forest reserve is home to 26 endemic birds and 20 rainforest species including the elusive red-faced malkoha the green-billed coucal and the sri lanka blue magpie

the untapped genetic potential of sinharaja flora is enormous of the 211 woody trees and lianas within the reserve 139 66 are endemic the total vegetation density including trees shrubs herbs and seedlings has been estimated at 240,000 individuals per hectare the minneriya national park borders the minneriya tank which is an important source of water for numerous elephants elephus maximus inhabiting the surrounding forests dubbed the gathering the congregation of elephants can be seen on the tank-bed in the late dry season august to october as the surrounding water sources steadily disappear the park also encompasses a range of micro-habitats which include classic dry zone tropical monsoonal evergreen forest thick stands of giant bamboo hilly pastures patanas and grasslands talawas
sri lanka is home to over 250 types of resident birds see list it has declared several bird sanctuaries including kumana during the mahaweli program of the 1970s and 1980s in northern sri lanka the government set aside four areas of land totalling 1,900 km2 730 sq mi as national parks sri lankas forest cover which was around 49% in 1920 had fallen to approximately 24% by 2009
