in mathematics an ellipse is a curve in a plane surrounding two focal points such that the sum of the distances to the two focal points is constant for every point on the curve as such it is a generalization of a circle which is a special type of an ellipse having both focal points at the same location the shape of an ellipse how elongated it is is represented by its eccentricity which for an ellipse can be any number from 0 the limiting case of a circle to arbitrarily close to but less than 1
ellipses are the closed type of conic section a plane curve resulting from the intersection of a cone by a plane see figure to the right ellipses have many similarities with the other two forms of conic sections parabolas and hyperbolas both of which are open and unbounded the cross section of a cylinder is an ellipse unless the section is parallel to the axis of the cylinder
analytically an ellipse may also be defined as the set of points such that the ratio of the distance of each point on the curve from a given point called a focus or focal point to the distance from that same point on the curve to a given line called the directrix is a constant this ratio is called the eccentricity of the ellipse
an ellipse may also be defined analytically as the set of points for each of which the sum of its distances to two foci is a fixed number
ellipses are common in physics astronomy and engineering for example the orbit of each planet in our solar system is approximately an ellipse with the barycenter of the planet–sun pair at one of the focal points the same is true for moons orbiting planets and all other systems having two astronomical bodies the shapes of planets and stars are often well described by ellipsoids ellipses also arise as images of a circle under parallel projection and the bounded cases of perspective projection which are simply intersections of the projective cone with the plane of projection it is also the simplest lissajous figure formed when the horizontal and vertical motions are sinusoids with the same frequency a similar effect leads to elliptical polarization of light in optics
the name ἔλλειψισ élleipsis omission was given by apollonius of perga in his conics emphasizing the connection of the curve with application of areas

 drawing ellipses 

ellipses appear in descriptive geometry as images parallel or central projection of circles for details see ellipses in dg german so it is essential to have tools to draw an ellipse nowadays the best tool is the computer during the times before this tool was not available and one was restricted to compass and ruler for the construction of single points of an ellipse but there are technical tools ellipsographs to draw an ellipse in a continuous way like a compass for drawing a circle too the principle of ellipsographs were known to greek mathematicians archimedes proklos already
if there is no ellipsograph available the best and quickest way to draw an ellipse is to draw an approximation by the four osculating circles at the vertices
for any method described below
the knowledge of the axes and the semi-axes is necessary or equivalent the foci and the semi-major axis
if this presumption is not fulfilled one has to know at least two conjugate diameters with help of rytzs construction the axes and semi-axes can be retrieved


 pins-and-string method 
the characterization of an ellipse as the locus of points so that sum of the distances to the foci is constant leads to a method of drawing one using two drawing pins a length of string and a pencil in this method pins are pushed into the paper at two points which become the ellipses foci a string tied at each end to the two pins and the tip of a pencil pulls the loop taut to form a triangle the tip of the pencil then traces an ellipse if it is moved while keeping the string taut using two pegs and a rope gardeners use this procedure to outline an elliptical flower bed—thus it is called the gardeners ellipse
a similar method for drawing confocal ellipses with a closed string is due to the irish bishop charles graves


 paper strip methods 
the two following methods rely on the parametric representation see section parametric representation above

  
    
      
        
        a
        cos
        ⁡
        t
        
        
        b
        sin
        ⁡
        t
        
      
    
    displaystyle acos tbsin t
  
this representation can be modeled technically by two simple methods in both cases center the axes and semi axes 
  
    
      
        a
        
        
        b
      
    
    displaystyle ab
   have to be known
method 1
the first method starts with
a strip of paper of length 
  
    
      
        a
        
        b
      
    
    displaystyle ab
  
the point where the semi axes meet is marked by 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    displaystyle p
   if the strip slides with both ends on the axes of the desired ellipse then point p traces the ellipse for the proof one shows that point 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    displaystyle p
   has the parametric representation 
  
    
      
        
        a
        cos
        ⁡
        t
        
        
        b
        sin
        ⁡
        t
        
      
    
    displaystyle acos tbsin t
   where parameter 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    displaystyle t
   is the angle of the slope of the paper strip
a technichal realization of the motion of the paper strip can be achieved by a tusi couple s animation the device is able to draw any ellipse with a fixed sum 
  
    
      
        a
        
        b
      
    
    displaystyle ab
   which is the radius of the large circle this restriction may be a disadvantage in real life more flexible is the second paper strip method
a nice application if one stands somewhere in the middle of a ladder which stands on a slippery ground and leans on a slippery wall the ladder slides down and the persons feet trace an ellipse

a variation of the paper strip method 1 uses the observation that the midpoint 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    displaystyle n
   of the paper strip is moving on the circle with center 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    displaystyle m
   of the ellipse and radius 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                a
                
                b
              
              2
            
          
        
      
    
    displaystyle tfrac ab2
   hence the paperstrip can be cut at point 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    displaystyle n
   into halves connected again by a joint at 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    displaystyle n
   and the sliding end 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    displaystyle k
   fixed at the center 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    displaystyle m
   see diagram after this operation the movement of the unchanged half of the paperstrip is unchanged the advantage of this variation is only one expensive sliding shoe is necessary
one should be aware that the end which is sliding on the minor axis has to be changed

method 2
the second method starts with
a strip of paper of length 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    displaystyle a
  
one marks the point which divides the strip into two substrips of length 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    displaystyle b
   and 
  
    
      
        a
        −
        b
      
    
    displaystyle a-b
   the strip is positioned onto the axes as described in the diagram then the free end of the strip traces an ellipse while the strip is moved for the proof one recognizes that the tracing point can be described parametrically by 
  
    
      
        
        a
        cos
        ⁡
        t
        
        
        b
        sin
        ⁡
        t
        
      
    
    displaystyle acos tbsin t
   where parameter 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    displaystyle t
   is the angle of slope of the paper strip
this method is the base for several ellipsographs see section below
remark similar to the variation of the paper strip method 1 a variation of the paper strip method 2 can be established see diagram by cutting the part between the axes into halves

 steiner generation of an ellipse

given two pencils

   all lines containing

    displaystyle u
   and 
  
    
      
        v

   respectively and a projective but not perspective mapping

   the points of the second quarter of the ellipse can be determined analogously one gets the points of the lower half of the ellipse
remark
the steiner generation exists for hyperbolas and parabolas too
the steiner generation is sometimes called a parallelogram method because one can use other points rather than the vertices which starts with a parallelogram instead of a rectangle

at first the masure is available for chords which are not parallel to the y-axis only but the final formula works for any chord
a consequence of the inscribed angle theorem for circles is the
3-point-form of a circles equation
one gets the equation of the circle determined by 3 points

like a circle such an ellipse is determined by three points not on a line
in this more general case one introduces the following measurement of an angle
in order to measure an angle between two lines with equations

at first the measure is available only for chords which are not parallel to the y-axis but the final formula works for any chord the proof follows from a straightforward calculation for the direction of proof given that the points are on an ellipse one can assume that the center of the ellipse is the origin
a consequence of the inscribed angle theorem for ellipses is the
3-point-form of an ellipses equation
one gets the equation of the ellipse determined by 3 points

such a relation between points and lines generated by a conic is called pole-polar relation or just polarity the pole is the point the polar the line see pole and polar
by calculation one checks the following properties of the pole-polar relation of the ellipse
for a point pole on the ellipse the polar is the tangent at this point see diagram

 applications 


 physics 


 elliptical reflectors and acoustics 

if the waters surface is disturbed at one focus of an elliptical water tank the circular waves of that disturbance after reflecting off the walls converge simultaneously to a single point the second focus this is a consequence of the total travel length being the same along any wall-bouncing path between the two foci
similarly if a light source is placed at one focus of an elliptic mirror all light rays on the plane of the ellipse are reflected to the second focus since no other smooth curve has such a property it can be used as an alternative definition of an ellipse in the special case of a circle with a source at its center all light would be reflected back to the center if the ellipse is rotated along its major axis to produce an ellipsoidal mirror specifically a prolate spheroid this property holds for all rays out of the source alternatively a cylindrical mirror with elliptical cross-section can be used to focus light from a linear fluorescent lamp along a line of the paper such mirrors are used in some document scanners
sound waves are reflected in a similar way so in a large elliptical room a person standing at one focus can hear a person standing at the other focus remarkably well the effect is even more evident under a vaulted roof shaped as a section of a prolate spheroid such a room is called a whisper chamber the same effect can be demonstrated with two reflectors shaped like the end caps of such a spheroid placed facing each other at the proper distance examples are the national statuary hall at the united states capitol where john quincy adams is said to have used this property for eavesdropping on political matters the mormon tabernacle at temple square in salt lake city utah at an exhibit on sound at the museum of science and industry in chicago in front of the university of illinois at urbana-champaign foellinger auditorium and also at a side chamber of the palace of charles v in the alhambra


 planetary orbits 

in the 17th century johannes kepler discovered that the orbits along which the planets travel around the sun are ellipses with the sun approximately at one focus in his first law of planetary motion later isaac newton explained this as a corollary of his law of universal gravitation
more generally in the gravitational two-body problem if the two bodies are bound to each other that is the total energy is negative their orbits are similar ellipses with the common barycenter being one of the foci of each ellipse the other focus of either ellipse has no known physical significance interestingly the orbit of either body in the reference frame of the other is also an ellipse with the other body at the same focus
keplerian elliptical orbits are the result of any radially directed attraction force whose strength is inversely proportional to the square of the distance thus in principle the motion of two oppositely charged particles in empty space would also be an ellipse however this conclusion ignores losses due to electromagnetic radiation and quantum effects which become significant when the particles are moving at high speed

 harmonic oscillators 
the general solution for a harmonic oscillator in two or more dimensions is also an ellipse such is the case for instance of a long pendulum that is free to move in two dimensions of a mass attached to a fixed point by a perfectly elastic spring or of any object that moves under influence of an attractive force that is directly proportional to its distance from a fixed attractor unlike keplerian orbits however these harmonic orbits have the center of attraction at the geometric center of the ellipse and have fairly simple equations of motion


 phase visualization 
in electronics the relative phase of two sinusoidal signals can be compared by feeding them to the vertical and horizontal inputs of an oscilloscope if the display is an ellipse rather than a straight line the two signals are out of phase


 elliptical gears 
two non-circular gears with the same elliptical outline each pivoting around one focus and positioned at the proper angle turn smoothly while maintaining contact at all times alternatively they can be connected by a link chain or timing belt or in the case of a bicycle the main chainring may be elliptical or an ovoid similar to an ellipse in form such elliptical gears may be used in mechanical equipment to produce variable angular speed or torque from a constant rotation of the driving axle or in the case of a bicycle to allow a varying crank rotation speed with inversely varying mechanical advantage
elliptical bicycle gears make it easier for the chain to slide off the cog when changing gears
an example gear application would be a device that winds thread onto a conical bobbin on a spinning machine the bobbin would need to wind faster when the thread is near the apex than when it is near the base


 optics 
in a material that is optically anisotropic birefringent the refractive index depends on the direction of the light the dependency can be described by an index ellipsoid if the material is optically isotropic this ellipsoid is a sphere
in lamp-pumped solid-state lasers elliptical cylinder-shaped reflectors have been used to direct light from the pump lamp coaxial with one ellipse focal axis to the active medium rod coaxial with the second focal axis
in laser-plasma produced euv light sources used in microchip lithography euv light is generated by plasma positioned in the primary focus of an ellipsoid mirror and is collected in the secondary focus at the input of the lithography machine


 statistics and finance 
in statistics a bivariate random vector x y is jointly elliptically distributed if its iso-density contours—loci of equal values of the density function—are ellipses the concept extends to an arbitrary number of elements of the random vector in which case in general the iso-density contours are ellipsoids a special case is the multivariate normal distribution the elliptical distributions are important in finance because if rates of return on assets are jointly elliptically distributed then all portfolios can be characterized completely by their mean and variance—that is any two portfolios with identical mean and variance of portfolio return have identical distributions of portfolio return


 computer graphics 
drawing an ellipse as a graphics primitive is common in standard display libraries such as the macintosh quickdraw api and direct2d on windows jack bresenham at ibm is most famous for the invention of 2d drawing primitives including line and circle drawing using only fast integer operations such as addition and branch on carry bit m l v pitteway extended bresenhams algorithm for lines to conics in 1967 another efficient generalization to draw ellipses was invented in 1984 by jerry van aken
in 1970 danny cohen presented at the computer graphics 1970 conference in england a linear algorithm for drawing ellipses and circles in 1971 l b smith published similar algorithms for all conic sections and proved them to have good properties these algorithms need only a few multiplications and additions to calculate each vector
it is beneficial to use a parametric formulation in computer graphics because the density of points is greatest where there is the most curvature thus the change in slope between each successive point is small reducing the apparent jaggedness of the approximation
drawing with bézier paths
composite bézier curves may also be used to draw an ellipse to sufficient accuracy since any ellipse may be construed as an affine transformation of a circle the spline methods used to draw a circle may be used to draw an ellipse since the constituent bézier curves behave appropriately under such transformations


 optimization theory 
it is sometimes useful to find the minimum bounding ellipse on a set of points the ellipsoid method is quite useful for attacking this problem
