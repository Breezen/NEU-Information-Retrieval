a property of a physical system such as the entropy of a gas that stays approximately constant when changes occur slowly is called an adiabatic invariant by this it is meant that if a system is varied between two end points as the time for the variation between the end points is increased to infinity the variation of an adiabatic invariant between the two end points goes to zero
in thermodynamics an adiabatic process is a change that occurs without heat flow and slowly compared to the time to reach equilibrium in an adiabatic process the system is in equilibrium at all stages under these conditions the entropy is constant
in mechanics an adiabatic change is a slow deformation of the hamiltonian where the fractional rate of change of the energy is much slower than the orbital frequency the area enclosed by the different motions in phase space are the adiabatic invariants
in quantum mechanics an adiabatic change is one that occurs at a rate much slower than the difference in frequency between energy eigenstates in this case the energy states of the system do not make transitions so that the quantum number is an adiabatic invariant
the old quantum theory was formulated by equating the quantum number of a system with its classical adiabatic invariant this determined the form of the bohr–sommerfeld quantization rule the quantum number is the area in phase space of the classical orbit


 thermodynamics 
in thermodynamics adiabatic changes are those that do not increase the entropy they occur slowly in comparison to the other characteristic timescales of the system of interest and allow heat flow only between objects at the same temperature for isolated systems an adiabatic change allows no heat to flow in or out


 adiabatic expansion of an ideal gas 
if a container with an ideal gas is expanded instantaneously the temperature of the gas doesnt change at all because none of the molecules slow down the molecules keep their kinetic energy but now the gas occupies a bigger volume if the container expands slowly however so that the ideal gas pressure law holds at any time gas molecules lose energy at the rate that they do work on the expanding wall the amount of work they do is the pressure times the area of the wall times the outward displacement which is the pressure times the change in the volume of the gas

 wiens law – adiabatic expansion of a box of light 
for a box of radiation ignoring quantum mechanics the energy of a classical field in thermal equilibrium is infinite since equipartition demands that each field mode has an equal energy on average and there are infinitely many modes this is physically ridiculous since it means that all energy leaks into high frequency electromagnetic waves over time
still without quantum mechanics there are some things that can be said about the equilibrium distribution from thermodynamics alone because there is still a notion of adiabatic invariance that relates boxes of different size
when a box is slowly expanded the frequency of the light recoiling from the wall can be computed from the doppler shift if the wall is not moving the light recoils at the same frequency if the wall is moving slowly the recoil frequency is only equal in the frame where the wall is stationary in the frame where the wall is moving away from the light the light coming in is bluer than the light coming out by twice the doppler shift factor vc

    displaystyle delta f2v over cf
  
on the other hand the energy in the light is also decreased when the wall is moving away because the light is doing work on the wall by radiation pressure because the light is reflected the pressure is equal to twice the momentum carried by light which is ec the rate at which the pressure does work on the wall is found by multiplying by the velocity

this means that the change in frequency of the light is equal to the work done on the wall by the radiation pressure the light that is reflected is changed both in frequency and in energy by the same amount

since moving the wall slowly should keep a thermal distribution fixed the probability that the light has energy e at frequency f must only be a function of ef
this function cannot be determined from thermodynamic reasoning alone and wien guessed at the form that was valid at high frequency he supposed that the average energy in high frequency modes was suppressed by a boltzmann-like factor this is not the expected classical energy in the mode which is

when the expectation value is added over all modes in a cavity this is wiens distribution and it describes the thermodynamic distribution of energy in a classical gas of photons wiens law implicitly assumes that light is statistically composed of packets that change energy and frequency in the same way the entropy of a wien gas scales as the volume to the power n where n is the number of packets this led einstein to suggest that light is composed of localizable particles with energy proportional to the frequency then the entropy of the wien gas can be given a statistical interpretation as the number of possible positions that the photons can be in

 old quantum theory 
after planck identified that wiens law can be extended to all frequencies even very low ones by interpolating with the classical equipartition law for radiation physicists wanted to understand the quantum behavior of other systems
the planck radiation law quantized the motion of the field oscillators in units of energy proportional to the frequency

the quantum can only depend on the energyfrequency by adiabatic invariance and since the energy must be additive when putting boxes end to end the levels must be equally spaced
einstein followed by debye extended the domain of quantum mechanics by considering the sound modes in a solid as quantized oscillators this model explained why the specific heat of solids approached zero at low temperatures instead of staying fixed at

   as predicted by classical equipartition
at the solvay conference the question of quantizing other motions was raised and lorentz pointed out a problem if you consider a quantum pendulum whose string is shortened very slowly the quantum number of the pendulum cannot change because at no point is there a high enough frequency to cause a transition between the states but the frequency of the pendulum changes when the string is shorter so the quantum states change energy
einstein responded that for slow pulling the frequency and energy of the pendulum both change but the ratio stays fixed this is analogous to wiens observation that under slow motion of the wall the energy to frequency ratio of reflected waves is constant the conclusion was that the quantities to quantize must be adiabatic invariants
this line of argument was extended by sommerfeld into a general theory the quantum number of an arbitrary mechanical system is given by the adiabatic action variable since the action variable in the harmonic oscillator is an integer the general condition is

this condition was the foundation of the old quantum theory which was able to predict the qualitative behavior of atomic systems the theory is inexact for small quantum numbers since it mixes classical and quantum concepts but it was a useful half-way step to the new quantum theory


 plasma physics 
in plasma physics there are three adiabatic invariants of charged particle motion


 the first adiabatic invariant μ 
the magnetic moment of a gyrating particle

   is the rate of any changes experienced by the particle eg due to collisions or due to temporal or spatial variations in the magnetic field consequently the magnetic moment remains nearly constant even for changes at rates approaching the gyrofrequency when μ is constant the perpendicular particle energy is proportional to b so the particles can be heated by increasing b but this is a one shot deal because the field cannot be increased indefinitely it finds applications in magnetic mirrors and magnetic bottles
there are some important situations in which the magnetic moment is not invariant
magnetic pumping if the collision frequency is larger than the pump frequency μ is no longer conserved in particular collisions allow net heating by transferring some of the perpendicular energy to parallel energy
cyclotron heating if b is oscillated at the cyclotron frequency the condition for adiabatic invariance is violated and heating is possible in particular the induced electric field rotates in phase with some of the particles and continuously accelerates them
magnetic cusps the magnetic field at the center of a cusp vanishes so the cyclotron frequency is automatically smaller than the rate of any changes thus the magnetic moment is not conserved and particles are scattered relatively easily into the loss cone

the longitudinal invariant of a particle trapped in a magnetic mirror

where the integral is between the two turning points is also an adiabatic invariant this guarantees for example that a particle in the magnetosphere moving around the earth always returns to the same line of force the adiabatic condition is violated in transit-time magnetic pumping where the length of a magnetic mirror is oscillated at the bounce frequency resulting in net heating


 the third adiabatic invariant φ 
the total magnetic flux φ enclosed by a drift surface is the third adiabatic invariant associated with the periodic motion of mirror-trapped particles drifting around the axis of the system because this drift motion is relatively slow φ is often not conserved in practical applications
