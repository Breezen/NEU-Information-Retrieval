the ecliptic is the circular path on the celestial sphere that the sun appears to follow over the course of a year it is the basis of the ecliptic coordinate system the term also refers to the plane of this path which is coplanar with earths orbit around the sun and hence the suns apparent orbit around earth the ecliptic is not normally noticeable from earths surface because earth rotates carrying the observer through the cycles of sunrise and sunset which obscure the suns apparent motion against the background of fixed stars


 suns apparent motion 
the motions as described above are simplifications due to the movement of earth around the earth–moon center of mass the apparent path of the sun wobbles slightly with a period of about one month due to further perturbations by the other planets of the solar system the earth–moon barycenter wobbles slightly around a mean position in a complex fashion the ecliptic is actually the apparent path of the sun throughout the course of a year
because earth takes one year to orbit the sun the apparent position of the sun takes one year to make a complete circuit of the ecliptic with slightly more than 365 days in one year the sun moves a little less than 1° eastward every day this small difference in the suns position against the stars causes any particular spot on earths surface to catch up with and stand directly north or south of the sun about four minutes later each day than it would if earth would not orbit a day on earth is therefore 24 hours long rather than the approximately 23-hour 56-minute sidereal day again this is a simplification based on a hypothetical earth that orbits at uniform speed around the sun the actual speed with which earth orbits the sun varies slightly during the year so the speed with which the sun seems to move along the ecliptic also varies for example the sun is north of the celestial equator for about 185 days of each year and south of it for about 180 days the variation of orbital speed accounts for part of the equation of time


 relationship to the celestial equator 

because earths rotational axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane earths equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane but is inclined to it by an angle of about 23.4° which is known as the obliquity of the ecliptic if the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere forming the celestial equator it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes the sun in its apparent motion along the ecliptic crosses the celestial equator at these points one from south to north the other from north to south the crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox also known as the first point of aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator the crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending node

the orientation of earths axis and equator are not fixed in space but rotate about the poles of the ecliptic with a period of about 26,000 years a process known as lunisolar precession as it is due mostly to the gravitational effect of the moon and sun on earths equatorial bulge likewise the ecliptic itself is not fixed the gravitational perturbations of the other bodies of the solar system cause a much smaller motion of the plane of earths orbit and hence of the ecliptic known as planetary precession the combined action of these two motions is called general precession and changes the position of the equinoxes by about 50 arc seconds about 0.014° per year

once again this is a simplification periodic motions of the moon and apparent periodic motions of the sun actually of earth in its orbit cause short-term small-amplitude periodic oscillations of earths axis and hence the celestial equator known as nutation this adds a periodic component to the position of the equinoxes the positions of the celestial equator and vernal equinox with fully updated precession and nutation are called the true equator and equinox the positions without nutation are the mean equator and equinox


 obliquity of the ecliptic 

obliquity of the ecliptic is the term used by astronomers for the inclination of earths equator with respect to the ecliptic or of earths rotation axis to a perpendicular to the ecliptic it is about 23.4° and is currently decreasing 0.013 degrees 47 arcseconds per hundred years due to planetary perturbations
the angular value of the obliquity is found by observation of the motions of earth and other planets over many years astronomers produce new fundamental ephemerides as the accuracy of observation improves and as the understanding of the dynamics increases and from these ephemerides various astronomical values including the obliquity are derived

until 1983 the obliquity for any date was calculated from work of newcomb who analyzed positions of the planets until about 1895
ε  23° 27′ 08″26 − 46″845 t − 0″0059 t2  0″00181 t3
where ε is the obliquity and t is tropical centuries from b1900.0 to the date in question
from 1984 the jet propulsion laboratorys de series of computer-generated ephemerides took over as the fundamental ephemeris of the astronomical almanac obliquity based on de200 which analyzed observations from 1911 to 1979 was calculated
ε  23° 26′ 21″45 − 46″815 t − 0″0006 t2  0″00181 t3
where hereafter t is julian centuries from j2000.0
jpls fundamental ephemerides have been continually updated the astronomical almanac for 2010 specifies
ε  23° 26′ 21″406 − 46″836769 t − 0″0001831 t2  0″00200340 t3 − 0″576×10−6 t4 − 4″34×10−8 t5
these expressions for the obliquity are intended for high precision over a relatively short time span perhaps ± several centuries j laskar computed an expression to order t10 good to 0″04/1000 years over 10,000 years
all of these expressions are for the mean obliquity that is without the nutation of the equator included the true or instantaneous obliquity includes the nutation


 plane of the solar system 

most of the major bodies of the solar system orbit the sun in nearly the same plane this is likely due to the way in which the solar system formed from a protoplanetary disk probably the closest current representation of the disk is known as the invariable plane of the solar system earths orbit and hence the ecliptic is inclined a little more than 1° to the invariable plane and the other major planets are also within about 6° of it because of this most solar system bodies appear very close to the ecliptic in the sky the ecliptic is well defined by the motion of the sun the invariable plane is defined by the angular momentum of the entire solar system essentially the summation of all of the orbital motions and rotations of all the bodies of the system a somewhat uncertain value that requires precise knowledge of every object in the system for these reasons the ecliptic is used as the reference plane of the solar system out of convenience


 celestial reference plane 

the ecliptic forms one of the two fundamental planes used as reference for positions on the celestial sphere the other being the celestial equator perpendicular to the ecliptic are the ecliptic poles the north ecliptic pole being the pole north of the equator of the two fundamental planes the ecliptic is closer to unmoving against the background stars its motion due to planetary precession being roughly 1/100 that of the celestial equator
spherical coordinates known as ecliptic longitude and latitude or celestial longitude and latitude are used to specify positions of bodies on the celestial sphere with respect to the ecliptic longitude is measured positively eastward 0° to 360° along the ecliptic from the vernal equinox the same direction in which the sun appears to move latitude is measured perpendicular to the ecliptic to 90° northward or -90° southward to the poles of the ecliptic the ecliptic itself being 0° latitude for a complete spherical position a distance parameter is also necessary different distance units are used for different objects within the solar system astronomical units are used and for objects near earth earth radii or kilometers are used a corresponding right-handed rectangular coordinate system is also used occasionally the x-axis is directed toward the vernal equinox the y-axis 90° to the east and the z-axis toward the north ecliptic pole the astronomical unit is the unit of measure symbols for ecliptic coordinates are somewhat standardized see the table
ecliptic coordinates are convenient for specifying positions of solar system objects as most of the planets orbits have small inclinations to the ecliptic and therefore always appear relatively close to it on the sky because earths orbit and hence the ecliptic moves very little it is a relatively fixed reference with respect to the stars

because of the precessional motion of the equinox the ecliptic coordinates of objects on the celestial sphere are continuously changing specifying a position in ecliptic coordinates requires specifying a particular equinox that is the equinox of a particular date known as an epoch the coordinates are referred to the direction of the equinox at that date for instance the astronomical almanac lists the heliocentric position of mars at 0h terrestrial time 4 jan 2010 as longitude 118° 09 158 latitude 1° 43 167 true heliocentric distance 1.6302454 au mean equinox and ecliptic of date this specifies the mean equinox of 4 jan 2010 0h tt as above without the addition of nutation


 eclipses 

because the orbit of the moon is inclined only about 5.145° to the ecliptic and the sun is always very near the ecliptic eclipses always occur on or near it because of the inclination of the moons orbit eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the sun and moon but only when the moon is near an ascending or descending node at the same time it is at conjunction or opposition the ecliptic is so named because the ancients noted that eclipses only occurred when the moon crossed it


 equinoxes and solstices 

the exact instants of equinoxes or solstices are the times when the apparent ecliptic longitude including the effects of aberration and nutation of the sun is 0° 90° 180° or 270° because of perturbations of earths orbit and peculiarities of the calendar the dates of these are not fixed 


 in the constellations 

the ecliptic currently passes through the following constellations


 astrology 

the ecliptic forms the center of a band about 20° wide called the zodiac on which the sun moon and planets are seen always to move traditionally this region is divided into 12 signs of 30° longitude each of which approximates the suns motion through one month in ancient times the signs corresponded roughly to 12 of the constellations that straddle the ecliptic these signs give us some of the terminology used today the first point of aries was named when the vernal equinox was actually in the constellation aries it has since moved into pisces
