mohammad abdus salam  punjabi urdu محمد عبد السلام‬‎ pronounced əbd̪ʊs səlɑm 29 january 1926 – 21 november 1996 was a pakistani theoretical physicist he shared the 1979 nobel prize in physics with sheldon glashow and steven weinberg for his contribution to the electroweak unification theory he was the first pakistani and the first muslim to receive a nobel prize in science and the second from an islamic country to receive any nobel prize after anwar sadat of egypt
salam was science advisor to the ministry of science and technology in pakistan from 1960 to 1974 a position from which he was supposed to play a major and influential role in the development of the countrys science infrastructure salam contributed to developments in theoretical and particle he was the founding director of the space and upper atmosphere research commission suparco and responsible for the establishment of the theoretical physics group tpg in the pakistan atomic energy commission paec as science advisor salam played a role in pakistans development of the peaceful use of nuclear energy and may have contributed as well to development of atomic bomb project of pakistan in 1972 for this he is viewed as the scientific father of this programme in 1974 abdus salam departed from his country in protest after the pakistan parliament passed unanimously parliamentary bill declaring qadiyanis members of the ahmadiyya movement to which salam belonged non muslims in 1998 following the countrys nuclear tests the government of pakistan issued a commemorative stamp as a part of scientists of pakistan to honour the services of salam
salams notable achievements include the pati–salam model magnetic photon vector meson grand unified theory work on supersymmetry and most importantly electroweak theory for which he was awarded the nobel prize salam made a major contribution in quantum field theory and in the advancement of mathematics at imperial college london with his student riazuddin salam made important contributions to the modern theory on neutrinos neutron stars and black holes as well as the work on modernising the quantum mechanics and quantum field theory as a teacher and science promoter salam is remembered as a founder and scientific father of mathematical and theoretical physics in pakistan during his term as the chief scientific advisor to the president salam heavily contributed to the rise of pakistani physics to the physics community in the world even until shortly before his death salam continued to contribute to physics and to advocate for the development of science in third-world countries


 biography 


 youth and education 
abdus salam was born to chaudhry muhammad hussain and hajira hussain into a punjabi muslim family that was part of the ahmadiyya movement in islam in terms of caste-affiliation they were jats of rajput descent from jhang on his fathers side while his mother was a kakazai from gurdaspur his grandfather gul muhammad was a religious scholar as well as a physician while his father was an education officer in the department of education of punjab state in a poor farming district
salam very early established a reputation throughout the punjab and later at the university of cambridge for outstanding brilliance and academic achievement at age 14 salam scored the highest marks ever recorded for the matriculation entrance examination at the punjab university he won a full scholarship to the government college university of lahore punjab state salam was a versatile scholar interested in urdu and english literature in which he excelled but he soon picked up mathematics as his concentration salams mentor and tutors wanted him to become an english teacher but salam decided to stick with mathematics as a fourth-year student there he published his work on srinivasa ramanujans problems in mathematics and took his ba in mathematics in 1944 his father wanted him to join indian civil service in those days the indian civil service was the highest aspiration for young university graduates and civil servants occupied a respected place in the civil society respecting his fathers wish salam tried for the indian railways but did not qualify for the service as he failed the medical optical tests because he had worn spectacles since an early age the results further concluded that salam failed a mechanical test required by the railway engineers to gain a commission in indian railways and moreover that salam was too young to compete for the job therefore indian railways rejected abdus salams job application while in lahore abdus salam went on to attend the graduate school of government college university he received his ma in mathematics from the government college university in 1946 that same year he was awarded a scholarship to st johns college cambridge where he completed a ba degree with double first-class honours in mathematics and physics in 1949 in 1950 he received the smiths prize from cambridge university for the most outstanding pre-doctoral contribution to physics after finishing his degrees fred hoyle advised salam to spend another year in the cavendish laboratory to do research in experimental physics but salam had no patience for carrying out long experiments in the laboratory salam returned to jhang punjab now part of pakistan and renewed his scholarship and returned to the united kingdom to do his doctorate
he obtained a phd degree in theoretical physics from the cavendish laboratory at cambridge his doctoral thesis titled developments in quantum theory of fields contained comprehensive and fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics by the time it was published in 1951 it had already gained him an international reputation and the adams prize during his doctoral studies his mentors challenged him to solve within one year an intractable problem which had defied such great minds as dirac and feynman within six months salam had found a solution for the renormalisation of meson theory as he proposed the solution at the cavendish laboratory salam had attracted the attention of bethe oppenheimer and dirac


 academic career 
after receiving his doctorate in 1951 salam returned to lahore at the government college university as a professor of mathematics where he remained till 1954 in 1952 he was appointed professor and chair of the department of mathematics at the neighbouring university of the punjab in the latter capacity salam sought to update the university curriculum introducing a course in quantum mechanics as a part of the undergraduate curriculum however this initiative was soon reverted by the vice-chancellor and salam decided to teach an evening course in quantum mechanics outside the regular curriculum while salam enjoyed a mixed popularity in the university he began to supervise the education of students who were particularly influenced by him as a result riazuddin remained the only student of salam who has the privilege to study under salam at the under-graduate and post-graduate level in lahore and post-doctoral level in cambridge university in 1953 salam was unable to establish a research institute in lahore as he faced strong opposition from his peers in 1954 salam took fellowship and became one of the earliest fellows of the pakistan academy of sciences as a result of 1953 lahore riots salam went back to cambridge and joined st johns college and took a position as a professor of mathematics in 1954 in 1957 he was invited to take a chair at imperial college london and he and paul matthews went on to set up the theoretical physics department at imperial college as time passed this department became one of the prestigious research departments that included well known physicists such as steven weinberg tom kibble gerald guralnik c r hagen riazuddin and john ward

in 1957 punjab university conferred salam with an honorary doctorate for his contribution in particle physics the same year with help from his mentor salam launched a scholarship programme for his students in pakistan salam retained strong links with pakistan and visited his country from time to time at cambridge and imperial college he formed a group of theoretical physicists the majority of whom were his pakistani students at age 33 salam became one of the youngest persons to be elected a fellow of the royal society frs in 1959 salam took a fellowship at the princeton university in 1959 where he met with j robert oppenheimer and to whom he presented his research work on neutrinos oppenheimer and salam discussed the foundation of electrodynamics problems and their solution his dedicated personal assistant was jean bouckley in 1980 salam became a foreign fellow of the bangladesh academy of sciences


 scientific career 
early in his career salam made an important and significant contribution in quantum electrodynamics and quantum field theory including its extension into particle and nuclear physics in his early career in pakistan salam was greatly interested in mathematical series and their relation to physics salam had played an influential role in the advancement of nuclear physics but he maintained and dedicated himself to mathematics and theoretical physics and focused pakistan to do more research in theoretical physics however he regarded nuclear physics nuclear fission and nuclear power as a non-pioneering part of physics as it had already happened even in pakistan salam was the leading driving force in theoretical physics in pakistan with many scientists he continued to influence and encourage to keep their work on theoretical physics
salam had a prolific research career in theoretical and high-energy physics salam had worked on theory of the neutrino – an elusive particle that was first postulated by wolfgang pauli in the 1930s salam introduced chiral symmetry in the theory of neutrinos the introduction of chiral symmetry played crucial role in subsequent development of the theory of electroweak interactions salam later passed his work to riazuddin who made pioneering contributions in neutrinos salam introduced the massive higgs bosons to the theory of the standard model where he later predicted the existence of proton decay in 1963 salam published his theoretical work on the vector meson the paper introduced the interaction of vector meson photon vector electrodynamics and the renormalisation of vector mesons known mass after the interaction in 1961 salam began to work with john clive ward on symmetries and electroweak unification in 1964 salam and ward worked on a gauge theory for the weak and electromagnetic interaction subsequently obtaining su2 × u1 model salam was convinced that all the elementary particle interactions are actually the gauge interactions in 1968 together with weinberg and sheldon glashow salam formulated the mathematical concept of their work while in imperial college salam along with glashow and jeffrey goldstone mathematically proved the goldstones theorem that a massless spin-zero object must appear in a theory as a result of spontaneous breaking of a continuous global symmetry in 1960 salam and weinberg incorporated the higgs mechanism into glashows discovery giving it a modern form in electroweak theory and thus theorised the standard model in 1968 together with weinberg and sheldon glashow salam finally formulated the mathematical concept of their work

in 1966 salam carried out pioneering work on a hypothetical particle salam showed the possible electromagnetic interaction between the magnetic monopole and the c-violation thus he formulated the magnetic photon
following the publication of prl symmetry breaking papers in 1964 steven weinberg and salam were the first to apply the higgs mechanism to electroweak symmetry breaking salam provided a mathematical postulation for the interaction between the higgs boson and the electroweak symmetry theory
in 1972 salam began to work with indian-american theoretical physicist jogesh pati pati wrote to salam several times expressing interest to work under salams direction in response to which salam eventually invited pati to the ictp seminar in pakistan salam suggested to pati that there should be some deep reason why the protons and electrons are so different and yet carry equal but opposite electric charge protons carry quarks but the electroweak theory was concerned only with the electrons and neutrinos with nothing postulated about quarks if all of natures ingredients could be brought together in one new symmetry it might reveal a reason for the various features of these particles and the forces they feel this led to the development of pati–salam model in particle physics in 1973 salam and jogesh pati were the first to notice that since quarks and leptons have very similar su2 × u1 representation content they all may have similar entities they provided a simple realisation of the quark-lepton symmetry by postulating that lepton number was a fourth colour dubbed violet
physicists had believed that there were four fundamental forces of nature the gravitational force the strong and weak nuclear forces and the electromagnetic force salam had worked on the unification of these forces from 1959 with glashow and weinberg while at imperial college london salam successfully showed that weak nuclear forces are not really different from electromagnetic forces and two could inter-convert salam provided a theory that shows the unification of two fundamental forces of nature weak nuclear forces and the electromagnetic forces one into another glashow had also formulated the same work and the theory was combined in 1966 in 1967 salam proved the electroweak unification theory mathematically and finally published the papers for this achievement salam glashow and weinberg were awarded the nobel prize in physics in 1979 the nobel prize foundation paid tribute to the scientists and issued a statement saying for their contributions to the theory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles including inter alia the prediction of the weak neutral current in the 1970s salam continued trying to unify forces by including the strong interaction in a grand unified theory


 government work 

abdus salam returned to pakistan in 1960 to take charge of a government post that was given to him by president field marshal ayub khan from her independence pakistan has never had a coherent science policy and the total expenditure on research and development represent 1.0% of pakistans gdp even the pakistan atomic energy commission paec headquarters was located in a small room and less than 10 scientists were working on a fundamental concepts of physics abdus salam replaced salimuzzaman siddiqui as science advisor became first member technical of pakistan atomic energy commission abdus salam expanded the web of physics research and development in pakistan by sending more than 500 scientists abroad in september 1961 abdus salam approached president ayub khan to set up the countrys first national space agency on 16 september 1961 through an executive order space and upper atmosphere research commission was established in which abdus salam served as the first director before 1960 very little work on scientific development was done and scientific activities in pakistan were almost diminished abdus salam called ishfaq ahmad a nuclear physicist who had left the country for switzerland where he joined cern to pakistan with the support of abdus salam paec established paec lahore center-6 with ishfaq ahmad as its first director in 1967 abdus salam became a central and administrative figure to lead the research in both theoretical and particle physics with the establishment of institute of physics at quaid-e-azam university the research in theoretical and particle physics was engaged under abdus salams direction physicists tackled the greatest outstanding problems in physics and mathematics another physicist raziuddin siddiqui established numerous physics research groups and supervised research activities in the academic institutions of pakistan under the direction of abdus salam research in physics reached a point that prompted worldwide recognition of pakistani physicists

from the 1950s salam had tried establishing high-powered research institutes in pakistan though he was unable to do so salam moved paec headquarters to a bigger building and established research laboratories all over the country on the direction of salam ishrat hussain usmani set up plutonium and uranium exploration committees throughout the country in october 1961 salam travelled to the united states and signed a space-co-operation agreement between pakistan and united states in november 1961 nasa started to build a space facility – flight test range – in balochistan where abdus salam served as its first technical director
abdus salam played an influential and significant role in pakistans development in nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in 1964 abdus salam was made head of pakistans iaea delegation and represented pakistan for a decade the same year abdus salam joined munir ahmad khan – abdus salams lifelong friend and contemporary at government college university khan was the first person in the iaea that abdus salam had consulted about the establishment of international centre for theoretical physics a research physics institution in trieste italy with an agreement signed with iaea the international centre for theoretical physics was set up with abdus salam as its first director at iaea abdus salam had advocated the importance of nuclear power plants in his country it was due to his effort that in 1965 canada and pakistan signed a nuclear energy co-operation deal salam had obtained the permission from ayub khan – against the wishes of ayub khans own government functionaries – to set up the nuclear power plant near karachi in 1965 with the efforts led by abdus salam the united states and pakistan signed an agreement in which the us provided pakistan with a small research reactor abdus salam had a long dream to establish a research institute in pakistan for which he had advocated on many different occasions in 1965 abdus salam and edward durrell stone signed a contract for the establishment of pakistan institute of nuclear science and technology at nilore islamabad


 space programme 

salam was the founder of pakistans space programme as he was responsible for the establishment of the space research activities in pakistan in early 1961 salam approached president ayub khan to lay the foundation of countrys first executive agency to co-ordinate space research on 16 september 1961 through an executive order the space and upper atmosphere research commission suparco was established of which salam was made its first and founder director of the agency salam immediately travelled to united states where he successfully signed a space co-operation agreement with united states government in november 1961 nasa built flight test center ftc in balochistan province during this time salam visited air force academy where he met with air commodore brigadier-general wladyslaw turowicz – a polish military scientist and an aerospace engineer turowicz was made the first technical director of the space centre and a programme of rocket testing ensued in 1964 while in the united states salam visited the oak ridge national laboratory and met with nuclear engineers salim mehmud and tariq mustafa salam signed another agreement with national aeronautics and space administration nasa in which nasa launched a programme to provide training to pakistans scientists and engineers both nuclear engineers returned to pakistan in few months and were inducted in suparco


 nuclear weapons programme 

salam knew the importance of nuclear technology in pakistan for civilian and peaceful purposes but according to his biographers salam played an ambiguous role in pakistans own integrated atomic bomb project as late as the 1960s salam made an unsuccessful attempt for a proposal for the establishment of nuclear fuel reprocessing plant but it was deferred the matter on economic grounds by ayub khan according to rehman salams influence in nuclear development was lessened and diminished as late as 1974 and he became critical of bhuttos control over science but salam personally did not terminate his connection with the scientists working in the theoretical physics division at paec as early as 1972–73 he had been a great advocate for the atomic bomb project but subsequently took a stance against it after he fell out with bhutto over the issue of the ahmaddiya denomination as non-islamic
in 1965 salam led the establishing of the nuclear research institute—pakistan institute of nuclear science and technology in 1965 the plutonium reactor pakistan atomic research reactor went critical under the leadership of salam in 1973 salam proposed the idea of establishing an annual college to promote scientific activities in the country to the chairman of paec munir ahmad khan who wholeheartedly accepted and fully supported this idea this led to the establishment of the international nathiagali summer college on physics and contemporary needs insc where each year since 1976 scientists from all over the world come to pakistan to interact with pakistani scientists the first annual insc conference was held on advanced particle and nuclear physics
in november 1971 salam met with zulfikar ali bhutto in his residence and following bhuttos advice salam went to united states to avoid the 1971 indo-pak winter war in 1971 salam had travelled to the united states and returned to pakistan with scientific literature about the manhattan project and calculations involving in atomic bombs in 1972 the government of pakistan learned about the development status of the first atomic bomb completed under the indian nuclear programme on 20 january 1972 at the multan meeting bhutto orchestrated to develop the deterrence programme former prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto formed a group of scientists and engineers which was first headed by salam in 1972 salam as science advisor to the president had managed and participated in a secret meeting of nuclear scientists with bhutto in multan which came to be known as the multan meeting at this meeting only ih usmani protested believing that the country had neither facilities nor talent to carry out such an ambitious and technologically remanding project at that time whilst salam remained quiet here bhutto entrusted salam and appointed munir ahmad khan as chairman of the paec and head of the atomic bomb program as salam had supported khan few months after the meeting salam along with khan and riazuddin met with bhutto in his residence where the scientists briefed bhutto about the nuclear weapons program after the meeting salam established the theoretical physics group tpg in paec abdus had led groundbreaking work at the tpg and was initially headed by salam until 1974
an office was set up for salam in the prime ministers secretariat by order of bhutto salam immediately started to motivate and invite scientists to begin work with paec in the development of fission weapons in december 1972 two theoretical physicists working at the international centre for theoretical physics were asked by salam to report to munir ahmad khan the scientific director of the program this marked the beginning of the theoretical physics group tpg reporting directly to salam the tpg in paec was assigned to conduct research in fast neutron calculations hydrodynamics how the explosion produced by a chain reaction might behave problems of neutron diffusion and the development of theoretical designs of pakistans nuclear weapon devices later the theoretical physics group working under the leadership of riazuddin who was also salams student began to directly report to salam and the work on the theoretical design of the nuclear weapon device was completed in 1977 hence salam had led the groundbreaking work in the development of the weapons programme with khan in 1972 salam had formed the mathematical physics group under raziuddin siddiqui that was charged with the theoretical physics group with carrying out research in the theory of simultaneity during the detonation process and the mathematics involved in the theory of nuclear fission following indias surprise nuclear test —pokhran-i – in 1974 munir ahmad khan had called for a meeting to initiate work on atomic bomb which was attended by salam and at which muhammad hafeez qureshi was appointed head of the directorate of technical development in paec
the dtd was set up to co-ordinate the work of the various specialised groups of scientists and engineers working on different aspects of the atomic bomb the word bomb was never used in this meeting but the participants fully understood what was being discussed on march 1974 salam and khan also established the wah group scientist that was charged with manufacturing materials explosive lenses and triggering mechanism development of the weapon following the setting up of dtd salam along with riazuddin and munir ahmad khan visited the pakistan ordnance factories pof where they held talks with senior military engineers led by pof chairman lieutenant-general qamar ali mirza it was there that the corps of engineers built the metallurgical laboratory in wah cantt in 1976 thus the wah group working under the dtd was charged with the material and triggering mechanism development of the weapon salam remained associated with the nuclear weapons programme until the mid-1974 when he left the country after ahmadi were declared non-muslims by the pakistani parliament his own relations with prime minister bhutto fell out and turned into open hostility after the ahmadiyya community was declared as not-islamic he lodged a public and powerful protest against bhutto regarding this issue and gave great criticism to bhutto over his control over science in spite of this salam maintained close relations with the theoretical physics division at paec who kept him informed about every status of the calculations needed to calculate the performance of the atomic bomb according to norman dombey after seeing indian aggression in northern pakistan followed by massive troops rotation in southern pakistan salam again renewed his ties with the senior scientists working in the atomic bomb projects including ishfaq ahmad and others who had kept him informed about the scientific development of the program in the 1980s salam personally approved many appointments and a large influx of pakistani scientists to the associateship program at ictp and cern and engaged in research in theoretical physics with his students at the ictp
in 2008 indian scholar ravi singh noted in his book that in 1978 abdus salam with paec officials paid a secret visit to china and was instrumental in initiating industrial nuclear cooperation between the two countries although he had left the country salam did not hesitate to advise the paec and theoretical and mathematical physics group on important scientific matters and kept his close association with tpg and paec


 advocacy for science 
in 1964 salam founded the international centre for theoretical physics ictp trieste in the north-east of italy and served as its director until 1993 in 1974 he founded international nathiagali summer college insc to promote science in his country the insc is an annual meeting of scientists from all over the world to come to pakistan and hold discussions on different aspects of physics and science even today the insc holds annual meetings and salams pupil student riazuddin is its director since its inception
in 1997 the scientists at ictp commemorated salam and renamed ictp as abdus salam international centre for theoretical physics salam had advocated for development of science in third world countries and attended various seminars in different countries throughout the years salam served on a number of united nations committees concerning science and technology in developing countries salam also founded the third world academy of sciences twas and was a leading figure in the creation of a number of international centres dedicated to the advancement of science and technology
during his visit at the institute of physics of quaid-i-azam university in 1979 salam had explained after receiving his award physicists believed there are four fundamental forces of nature the gravitational force the weak and strong nuclear force and the electromagnetic force salam was a firm believer that scientific thought is the common heritage of mankind and that developing nations needed to help themselves and invest in their own scientists to boost development and reduce the gap between the global south and the global north thus contributing to a more peaceful world
in 1981 salam became a founding member of the world cultural council
although salam had departed from pakistan he did not terminate his connection to pakistan salam continued inviting pakistans scientists to ictp and maintained a research programme for the pakistani scientists many prominent scientists including ghulam murtaza riazuddin kamaluddin ahmed faheem hussain raziuddin siddiqui munir ahmad khan ishfaq ahmad and i h usmani considered him as their mentor and a teacher


 personal life 
salam was a very private individual who kept his public and personal lives quite separate he married twice first time to a cousin the second time in accordance with islamic law and at his death was survived by three daughters and a son by his first wife and a son and daughter by his second professor dame louise johnson formerly professor of molecular biophysics in oxford university two of his daughters are anisa bushra salam bajwa and aziza rahman


 religion 
abdus salam was an ahmadi muslim who saw his religion as a fundamental part of his scientific work he once wrote that the holy quran enjoins us to reflect on the verities of allahs created laws of nature however that our generation has been privileged to glimpse a part of his design is a bounty and a grace for which i render thanks with a humble heart
during his acceptance speech for the nobel prize in physics salam quoted verses from the quran and stated

thou seest not in the creation of the all-merciful any imperfection return thy gaze seest thou any fissure then return thy gaze again and again thy gaze comes back to thee dazzled aweary 673–4
this in effect is the faith of all physicists the deeper we seek the more is our wonder excited the more is the dazzlement for our gaze

in 1974 the pakistan parliament made a constitutional amendment that declared ahmadi as non-muslims in protest salam left pakistan for london after his departure salam did not completely terminate his connection to pakistan and kept his close association with the theoretical physics group as well as academic scientists from pakistan atomic energy commission paec at ictp salam had launched series of post-research programmes for pakistani academics with whom he had developed extremely close relations in 1983 riazuddin and asghar qadir returned to ictp where they had joined salam and stayed with him until 1990


 death 

abdus salam died peacefully on 21 november 1996 at the age of 70 in oxford england from progressive supranuclear palsy psp his body was returned to pakistan and kept in darul ziafat where some 13,000 men and women visited to pay their last respects approximately 30,000 people attended his funeral prayers
salam was buried in bahishti maqbara a cemetery established by the ahmadiyya community at rabwah punjab pakistan next to his parents graves the epitaph on his tomb initially read first muslim nobel laureate the pakistani government removed muslim and left only his name on the headstone the word muslim was initially obscured on the orders of a local magistrate before moving to the national level under ordinance xx being an ahmadi he was considered a non-muslim according to the definition provided in the ii amendment to the constitution of pakistan


 legacy 
salams work in pakistan has been far reaching and regarded as highly influential salam is remembered as his peers and students as the father of pakistans school of theoretical physics as well as pakistans science abdus salam was a charismatic and an iconic figure as much as a symbol among them of what they were working or researching toward in their respected field his students fellow scientists and engineers remembered him as brilliant teacher and engaging researcher who would also influence among others to do the same salam founded the space research commission of which he served its first founding director in the 1980s in 1998 the government of pakistan issued a commemorative stamp to honour the services of salam as part of its scientists of pakistan series his alma mater government college lahore now a university has abdus salam chair in physics and abdus salam school of mathematical sciences named after him the abdus salam chair was also established in his honour at the syed babar ali school of science and engineering in lahore university of management sciences despite the immense services he had done for pakistan and the government he has been discriminated against because of his affiliation with the ahmadiyya sect which the pakistan government has denounced he has also made a significant contribution towards the recent success of search for the higgs boson
however salam has been commemorated by pakistans noted and prominent scientists who were also his students many scientists have recalled their college experiences ghulam murtaza a professor of plasma physics at the government college university and student of salam wrote

when dr salam was to deliver a lecture the hall would be packed and although the subject was particle physics his manner and eloquence was such as if he was talking about literature when he finished his lectures listeners would often burst into spontaneous applause and give him a standing ovation people from all parts of the world would come to imperial college and seek dr salams help he would give a patient hearing to everyone including those who were talking nonsense he treated everyone with respect and compassion and never belittled or offended anyone dr salams strength was that he could sift jewels from the sand

ishfaq ahmad former chairman of the paec and a lifelong friend of salam recalls

dr salam was responsible for sending about 500 physicists mathematicians and scientists from pakistan for phds to the best institutions in uk and usa

in august 1996 the former chairman of paec and lifelong friend munir ahmad khan met salam in oxford munir ahmad khan who headed the nuclear weapons and energy programme said

my last meeting with abdus salam was only three months ago his disease had taken its toll and he was unable to talk yet he understood what was said i told him about the celebration held in pakistan on his seventieth birthday he kept staring at me he had risen above praise as i rose to leave he pressed my hand to express his feelings as if he wanted to thank everyone who had said kind words about him dr abdus salam had deep love for pakistan in spite of the fact that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country it became more and more difficult for him to come to pakistan and this hurt him deeply now he has returned home finally to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much may be in the years to come we will rise above our prejudice and own him and give him after his death what we could not when he was alive we pakistanis may choose to ignore dr salam but the world at large will always remember him


 documentaries on abdus salam 
salam – the film
llc started formally researching and developing a film on the science and life of abdus salam in 2004 two years after the producers had conceived of the idea a fundraising teaser was released by kailoola productions to coincide with salams birth anniversary on 29 january 2017 the post-production phase of this documentary film pending funding is estimated at us150,000
abdus salam the dream of symmetry
pilgrim films released the dream of symmetry in september 2011 their press release describes it as presenting the extraordinary figure of abdus salam who not only was an outstanding scientist but also a generous humanitarian and a valuable person his rich and busy life was an endless quest for symmetry that he pursued in the universe of physical laws and in the world of human beings


 honours 

dr salams genius was like a magic and there was always an element of eastern mysticism in his ideas that left one wondering how to fathom his genius

in 1997 scientists at ictp renamed the institute as the abdus salam international centre for theoretical physics in the honour of salam salams services have been recognised in pakistan as his students have openly spoken and stressed the importance of science and technology in pakistan in 1999 per the recommendation of ishfaq ahmad the federal government led the establishment of salam chair in physics at the government college university on 22 november 2009 the director of abdus salam international centre for theoretical physics had gifted the original nobel prize certificate to his alma mater in 2011 gcus salam chair in physics held a one-day-long conference that was attributed to nobel laureate abdus salam salams students ghulam murtaza perviaz hoodbhoy riazuddin and tariq zaidi discussed the life and works of the nobel laureate and brought to light the achievement of salam in pakistan and in the physics while covering the media converge on salams tribute the news international called salam as the great pakistan scientist
in 1998 the edward a bouchet-ictp institute was renamed as edward bouchet abdus salam institute in 2003 government of punjab created the institute of excellence for the mathematical sciences abdus salam school of mathematical sciences in salams alma mater – government college university

that it has taken nearly four decades for this country to honour a globally renowned scientist who was one of its own is a sad reflection of the priorities that hold sway here for dr salam was an ahmadi a persecuted minority in pakistan and his faith rather than his towering achievements was the yardstick by which he was judged

in 2008 in an opinion daily times called salam one of the greatest scientist pakistan has ever produced
in 2015 the academy of young researchers and scholars lahore renamed its library to abdus salam library in the town of vaughan ontario canada near the headquarters of the canadian branch of the ahmadiyya community of which professor abdus salam was a member the community has named a street after his name it is called abdus salam street additionally there are two annual abdus salam science fairs one held in canada and the other in the us each is organised as a national event for young scientists from the ahmadiyya community in an effort to motivate youth toward scientific endeavour
on december 6 2016 pakistans prime minister nawaz sharif approved the renaming of quaid-i-azam universitys qau physics centre to the professor abdus salam center for physics it was also announced that professor abdus salam fellowship will be established which will include five annual fully funded pakistani phd students in the field of physics in leading international universities


 awards 

in 1979 salam was awarded the 1979 nobel prize in physics along with glashow and weinberg for their contributions to the theory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles including inter alia the prediction of the weak neutral current salam received high civil and science awards from all over the world salam is recipient of first high civil awards – star of pakistan 1959 and the nishan-e-imtiaz 1979 – awarded both by president of pakistan for his outstanding services to pakistan the national center for physics ncp contains a abdus salam museum dedicated to the life of salam and his work as he discovered and formulated the electroweak theory below is the list of awards that were conferred to salam in his lifetime


 awards named after salam 
the abdus salam award also called as salam prize is an award in natural and physical sciences established to recognised the high achievements and contributions in physical and natural sciences in 1979 riazuddin fayyazuddin and asghar qadir met with salam and presented the idea of creating an award to appreciate scientists resident in pakistan in their respective fields salam had donated the money he had won as he felt that he had no rightly use of the prize money it was endowed by asghar qadir riazuddin and fayyazuddin in 1980 and it was first awarded in 1981 the winners are selected by a committee consisted of aghar qadir fayyazuddin riazuddin and others of the center for advanced mathematics and physics camp which administers the award the abdus salam medal is presented by the third world academy of sciences in trieste italy first given in 1995 the award is presented to the people who have served the cause of science in the developing world the abdus salam shield of honor in mathematics was initiated by the national mathematical society of pakistan to promote and recognize quality research in mathematics at 2015 it is awarded for the first time in 2016


 contributions 
salams primary focus was research on the physics of elementary particles his particular numerous groundbreaking contributions included
two-component neutrino theory and the prediction of the inevitable parity violation in weak interaction
gauge unification of weak and electromagnetic interactions the unified force is called the electroweak force a name given to it by salam and which forms the basis of the standard model in particle physics
predicted existence of weak neutral currents and w particles and z particles before their experimental discovery
symmetry properties of elementary particles unitary symmetry
renormalisation of meson theories
gravity theory and its role in particle physics two tensor theory of gravity and strong interaction physics
unification of electroweak with strong nuclear forces grand unification theory
related prediction of proton-decay
pati–salam model a grand unification theory
supersymmetry theory in particular formulation of superspace and formalism of superfields in 1974
the theory of supermanifolds as a geometrical framework for understanding supersymmetry in 1974
supergeometry the geometric basis for supersymmetry in 1974
application of the higgs mechanism to the electroweak symmetry breaking
prediction of the magnetic photon in 1966
