a total solar eclipse occurred on saturday march 7 1970 visible across most of north america and central america
a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between earth and the sun thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the sun for a viewer on earth a total solar eclipse occurs when the moons apparent diameter is larger than the suns blocking all direct sunlight turning day into darkness totality occurs in a narrow path across earths surface with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide
totality was visible across southern mexico and the gulf of mexico the southeast atlantic coast of the united states northeast to the maritimes of eastern canada and northern miquelon-langlade in the french overseas collectivity of saint pierre and miquelon
greatest eclipse occurred over mexico at 1138 am cst with totality lasting 3 minutes and 28 seconds totality over the us lasted up to 3 minutes and 10 seconds the media declared perry as the first municipality in florida to be in the eclipse direct path
unfortunately inclement weather obstructed the viewing from that location and most of the eclipse path through the remainder of the southern states there will not be an eclipse with a greater duration of totality over the contiguous us until april 8 2024 a period of 54 years
