lunar tourism may be possible in the future if trips to the moon are made affordable to the public some space tourism startup companies are planning to offer tourism on or around the moon and estimate this to be possible sometime between 2018 and 2043

 protection of lunar landmarks 

the site of the first human landing on an extraterrestrial body tranquility base has been determined to have cultural and historic significance by the us states of california and new mexico which have listed it on their heritage registers since their laws require only that listed sites have some association with the state despite the location of mission control in houston texas has not granted similar status to the site as its historic preservation laws limit such designations to properties located within the state the us national park service has declined to grant it national historic landmark status because the outer space treaty prohibits any nation from claiming sovereignty over any extraterrestrial body it has not been proposed as a world heritage site since the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco which oversees that program limits nations to submitting sites within their own borders
interest in affording historical lunar landing sites some formal protection grew in the early 21st century with the announcement of the google lunar x prize for private corporations to successfully build spacecraft and reach the moon a 1 million bonus was offered for any competitor that visited a historic site on the moon one team led by astrobotic technology announced it would attempt to land a craft at tranquility base although it canceled those plans the ensuing controversy led nasa to request that any other missions to the moon private or governmental human or robotic keep a distance of at least 75 meters 246 ft from the site


 proposed missions 
the company space adventures has announced a planned mission titled dse-alpha to take two tourists within 100 kilometers 54 nautical miles of the lunar surface using a soyuz spacecraft piloted by a professional cosmonaut the trip would last around a week
excalibur almaz proposed to take three tourists in a flyby around the moon using modified almaz space station modules in a low-energy trajectory flyby around the moon the trip would last around 6 months however their equipment was never launched and is to be converted into an educational exhibit
in february 2017 spacex announced it had accepted deposits for a week-long flyby mission to the moon set for late 2018 in a dragon 2 capsule carrying two moon tourists to be launched via falcon heavy rocket
