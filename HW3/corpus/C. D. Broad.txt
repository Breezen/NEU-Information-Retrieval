 psychical research 
broad argued that if research showed that psychic events occur this would challenge philosophical theories of basic limiting principles in at least five ways
backward causation the future affecting the past is rejected by many philosophers but would be shown to occur if for example people could predict the future
one common argument against dualism that is the belief that minds are non-physical and bodies physical is that physical and non-physical things cannot interact however this would be shown to be possible if people can move physical objects by thought telekinesis
similarly philosophers tend to be skeptical about claims that non-physical stuff could interact with anything this would also be challenged if minds are shown to be able to communicate with each other as would be the case if mind-reading is possible
philosophers generally accept that we can only learn about the world through reason and perception this belief would be challenged if people were able to psychically perceive events in other places
physicalist philosophers believe that there cannot be persons without bodies if ghosts were shown to exist this view would be challenged


 free will 
broad argued for non-occurrent causation as literally determined by the agent or self the agent could be considered as a substance or continuant and not by a total cause which contains as factors events in and dispositions of the agent thus our efforts would be completely determined but their causes would not be prior events
new series of events would then originate which he called continuants these are essentially causa sui
peter van inwagen says that broad formulated an excellent version of what van inwagen has called the consequence argument in defense of incompatibilism
