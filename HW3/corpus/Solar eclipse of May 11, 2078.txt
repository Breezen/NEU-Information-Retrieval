a total solar eclipse will occur on may 11 2078 a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between earth and the sun thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the sun for a viewer on earth a total solar eclipse occurs when the moons apparent diameter is larger than the suns blocking all direct sunlight turning day into darkness totality occurs in a narrow path across earths surface with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide


 related eclipses 


 solar eclipses 2076-2079 
each member in a semester series of solar eclipses repeats approximately every 177 days and 4 hours a semester at alternating nodes of the moons orbit


 saros 139 
it is a part of saros series 139 repeating every 18 years 11 days 8 hours containing 71 events the series started with partial solar eclipse on may 17 1501 it contains hybrid eclipses on august 11 1627 through december 9 1825 and total eclipses from december 21 1843 through march 26 2601 the series ends at member 71 as a partial eclipse on july 3 2763 members in the same column are one exeligmos apart and thus occur in the same geographic area
the solar eclipse of june 13 2132 will be the longest total solar eclipse since july 11 1991 at 6 minutes 55 seconds
the longest duration of totality will be produced by member 39 at 7 minutes 29 seconds on july 16 2186 this is the longest solar eclipse computed between 4000bc and 6000ad


 inex series 
this eclipse is a part of the long period inex cycle repeating at alternating nodes every 358 synodic months ≈ 10,571.95 days or 29 years minus 20 days their appearance and longitude are irregular due to a lack of synchronization with the anomalistic month period of perigee however groupings of 3 inex cycles ≈ 87 years minus 2 months comes close ≈ 1,151.02 anomalistic months so eclipses are similar in these groupings
