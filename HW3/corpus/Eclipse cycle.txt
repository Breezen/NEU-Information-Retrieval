eclipses may occur repeatedly separated by certain intervals of time these intervals are called eclipse cycles the series of eclipses separated by a repeat of one of these intervals is called an eclipse series


 eclipse conditions 
eclipses may occur when the earth and the moon are aligned with the sun and the shadow of one body cast by the sun falls on the other so at new moon when the moon is in conjunction with the sun the moon may pass in front of the sun as seen from a narrow region on the surface of the earth and cause a solar eclipse at full moon when the moon is in opposition to the sun the moon may pass through the shadow of the earth and a lunar eclipse is visible from the night half of the earth conjunction and opposition of the moon together have a special name syzygy from greek for junction because of the importance of these lunar phases
an eclipse does not happen at every new or full moon because the plane of the orbit of the moon around the earth is tilted with respect to the plane of the orbit of the earth around the sun the ecliptic so as seen from the earth when the moon is nearest to the sun new moon or at largest distance full moon the three bodies usually are not exactly on the same line
this inclination is on average about 5° 9′ much larger than the apparent mean diameter of the sun 32′ 2″ the moon as seen from the surface of the earth right beneath the moon 31′ 37″ and the shadow of the earth at the mean lunar distance 1° 23′
therefore at most new moons the earth passes too far north or south of the lunar shadow and at most full moons the moon misses the shadow of the earth also at most solar eclipses the apparent angular diameter of the moon is insufficient to fully obscure the solar disc unless the moon is near its perigee ie closer to the earth and apparently larger than average in any case the alignment must be close to perfect to cause an eclipse
an eclipse can only occur when the moon is close to the plane of the orbit of the earth ie when its ecliptic latitude is small this happens when the moon is near one of the two nodes of its orbit on the ecliptic at the time of the syzygy of course to produce an eclipse the sun must also be near a node at that time the same node for a solar eclipse or the opposite node for a lunar eclipse


 recurrence 

up to three eclipses may occur during an eclipse season a one- or two-month period that happens twice a year around the time when the sun is near the nodes of the moons orbit
an eclipse does not occur every month because one month after an eclipse the relative geometry of the sun moon and earth has changed
as seen from the earth the time it takes for the moon to return to a node the draconic month is less than the time it takes for the moon to return to the same ecliptic longitude as the sun the synodic month the main reason is that during the time that the moon has completed an orbit around the earth the earth and moon have completed about ​1⁄13 of their orbit around the sun the moon has to make up for this in order to come again into conjunction or opposition with the sun secondly the orbital nodes of the moon precess westward in ecliptic longitude completing a full circle in about 18.60 years so a draconic month is shorter than a sidereal month in all the difference in period between synodic and draconic month is nearly ​2 1⁄3 days likewise as seen from the earth the sun passes both nodes as it moves along its ecliptic path the period for the sun to return to a node is called the eclipse or draconic year about 346.6201 d which is about ​1⁄20 year shorter than a sidereal year because of the precession of the nodes
if a solar eclipse occurs at one new moon which must be close to a node then at the next full moon the moon is already more than a day past its opposite node and may or may not miss the earths shadow by the next new moon it is even further ahead of the node so it is less likely that there will be a solar eclipse somewhere on earth by the next month there will certainly be no event
however about 5 or 6 lunations later the new moon will fall close to the opposite node in that time half an eclipse year the sun will have moved to the opposite node too so the circumstances will again be suitable for one or more eclipses


 periodicity 
these are still rather vague predictions however we know that if an eclipse occurred at some moment then there will occur an eclipse again s synodic months later if that interval is also d draconic months where d is an integer number return to same node or an integer number  ½ return to opposite node so an eclipse cycle is any period p for which approximately holds
p  s×synodic month length  d×draconic month length
given an eclipse then there is likely to be another eclipse after every period p this remains true for a limited time because the relation is only approximate
another thing to consider is that the motion of the moon is not a perfect circle its orbit is distinctly elliptic so the lunar distance from earth varies throughout the lunar cycle this varying distance changes the apparent diameter of the moon and therefore influences the chances duration and type partial annular total mixed of an eclipse this orbital period is called the anomalistic month and together with the synodic month causes the so-called full moon cycle of about 14 lunations in the timings and appearances of full and new moons the moon moves faster when it is closer to the earth near perigee and slower when it is near apogee furthest distance thus periodically changing the timing of syzygies by up to ±14 hours relative to their mean timing and changing the apparent lunar angular diameter by about ±6 an eclipse cycle must comprise close to an integer number of anomalistic months in order to perform well in predicting eclipses


 numerical values 
these are the lengths of the various types of months as discussed above according to the lunar ephemeris elp2000-85 valid for the epoch j2000.0 taken from eg meeus 1991 
sm  29.530588853 days synodic month
dm  27.212220817 days draconic month
am  27.55454988 days anomalistic month
ey  346.620076 days eclipse year
note that there are three main moving points the sun the moon and the ascending node and that there are three main periods when each of the three possible pairs of moving points meet one another the synodic month when the moon returns to the sun the draconic month when the moon returns to the node and the eclipse year when the sun returns to the node these three 2-way relations are not independent ie both the synodic month and eclipse year are dependent on the apparent motion of the sun both the draconic month and eclipse year are dependent on the motion of the nodes and indeed the eclipse year can be described as the beat period of the synodic and draconic months ie the period of the difference between the synodic and draconic months in formula

as can be checked by filling in the numerical values listed above
eclipse cycles have a period in which a certain number of synodic months closely equals an integer or half-integer number of draconic months one such period after an eclipse a syzygy new moon or full moon takes place again near a node of the moons orbit on the ecliptic and an eclipse can occur again howeverthe synodic and draconic months are incommensurate their ratio is not an integer number we need to approximate this ratio by common fractions the numerators and denominators then give the multiples of the two periods – draconic and synodic months – that approximately span the same amount of time representing an eclipse cycle
these fractions can be found by the method of continued fractions this arithmetical technique provides a series of progressively better approximations of any real numeric value by proper fractions
since there may be an eclipse every half draconic month we need to find approximations for the number of half draconic months per synodic month so the target ratio to approximate is sm  dm2  29.530588853  27.212220817/2  2.170391682

each of these is an eclipse cycle less accurate cycles may be constructed by combinations of these


 eclipse cycles 
this table summarizes the characteristics of various eclipse cycles and can be computed from the numerical results of the preceding paragraphs cf meeus 1997 ch9 more details are given in the comments below and several notable cycles have their own pages
any eclipse cycle and indeed the interval between any two eclipses can be expressed as a combination of saros s and inex i intervals these are listed in the column formula
notes
fortnight
half a synodic month 29.53 days when there is an eclipse there is a fair chance that at the next syzygy there will be another eclipse the sun and moon will have moved about 15° with respect to the nodes the moon being opposite to where it was the previous time but the luminaries may still be within bounds to make an eclipse
for example partial solar eclipse of june 1 2011 is followed by the total lunar eclipse of june 16 2011 and partial solar eclipse of july 1 2011
for more information see eclipse season
synodic month
similarly two events one synodic month apart have the sun and moon at two positions on either side of the node 29° apart both may cause a partial eclipse
pentalunex
5 synodic months successive solar or lunar eclipses may occur 1 5 or 6 synodic months apart
semester
half a lunar year eclipses will repeat exactly one semester apart at alternating nodes in a cycle that lasts for 8 eclipses because it is close to a half integer of anomalistic draconic months and tropical years each solar eclipse will alternate between hemispheres each semester as well as alternate between total and annular hence there can be a maximum of one total or annular eclipse each in a given year
lunar year
twelve synodic months a little longer than an eclipse year the sun has returned to the node so eclipses may again occur
octon
this is ​1⁄5 of the metonic cycle and a fairly decent short eclipse cycle but poor in anomalistic returns each octon in a series is 2 saros apart always occurring at the same node
tzolkinex
includes a half draconic month so occurs at alternating nodes and alternates between hemispheres each consecutive eclipse is a member of preceding saros series from the one before equal to ten tzolkins every third tzolkinex in a series is near an integer number of anomalistic months and so will have similar properties
sar half saros
includes an odd number of fortnights 223 as a result eclipses alternate between lunar and solar with each cycle occurring at the same node and with similar characteristics a long central total solar eclipse will be followed by a very central total lunar eclipse a solar eclipse where the moons penumbra just barely grazes the southern limb of earth will be followed half a saros later by a lunar eclipse where the moon just grazes the southern limb of the earths penumbra
tritos
a mediocre cycle relates to the saros like the inex a triple tritos is close to an integer number of anomalistic months and so will have similar properties
saros 
the best known eclipse cycle and one of the best for predicting eclipses in which 223 synodic months equal 242 draconic months with an error of only 51 minutes it is also close to 239 anomalistic months which makes the circumstances between two eclipses one saros apart very similar
metonic cycle or enneadecaeteris
this is nearly equal to 19 tropical years but is also 5 octon periods and close to 20 eclipse years so it yields a short series of eclipses on the same calendar date it consists of 110 hollow months and 125 full months so nominally 6940 days and equals 235 lunations 235 synodic months with an error of only around 7.5 hours
inex
very convenient in the classification of eclipse cycles inex series after a sputtering beginning go on for many thousands of years giving eclipses every 29 years or so one inex after an eclipse another eclipse takes place at almost the same longitude but at the opposite latitude
exeligmos
a triple saros with the advantage that it has nearly an integer number of days so the next eclipse will be visible at locations near the eclipse that occurred one exeligmos earlier in contrast to the saros in which the eclipse occurs about 8 hours later in the day or about 120° to the west of the eclipse that occurred one saros earlier
callippic cycle
441 hollow months and 499 full months thus 4 metonic cycles minus one day or precisely 76 years of ​365 1⁄4 days it equals 940 lunations with an error of only 5.9 hours
triad
a triple inex with the advantage that it has nearly an integer number of anomalistic months which makes the circumstances between two eclipses one triad apart very similar but at the opposite latitude almost exactly 87 calendar years minus 2 months the triad means that every third saros series will be similar mostly total central eclipses or annular central eclipses for example saros 130 133 136 139 142 and 145 for example all produce mainly total central eclipses
hipparchic cycle
not a noteworthy eclipse cycle but hipparchus constructed it to closely match an integer number of synodic and anomalistic months years 345 and days by comparing his own eclipse observations with babylonian records from 345 years earlier he could verify the accuracy of the various periods that the chaldeans used
babylonian
the ratio 5923 returns to latitude in 5458 months was used by the chaldeans in their astronomical computations
tetradia
sometimes 4 total lunar eclipses occur in a row with intervals of 6 lunations semester and this is called a tetrad giovanni schiaparelli noticed that there are eras when such tetrads occur comparatively frequently interrupted by eras when they are rare this variation takes about 6 centuries antonie pannekoek 1951 offered an explanation for this phenomenon and found a period of 591 years van den bergh 1954 from theodor von oppolzers canon der finsternisse found a period of 586 years this happens to be an eclipse cycle see meeus i 1997 recently tudor hughes explained the variation from secular changes in the eccentricity of the earths orbit the period for occurrence of tetrads is variable and currently is about 565 years see meeus iii 2004 for a detailed discussion


 saros series and inex series 
any eclipse can be assigned to a given saros series and inex series the year of a solar eclipse in the gregorian calendar is then given approximately by
year  28.945 × number of the saros series  18.030 × number of the inex series − 2882.55
when this is greater than 1 the integer part gives the year ad but when it is negative the year bc is obtained by taking the integer part and adding 2 for instance the eclipse in saros series zero and inex series zero was in the middle of 2884 bc
