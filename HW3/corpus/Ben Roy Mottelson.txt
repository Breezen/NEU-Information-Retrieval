ben roy mottelson born july 9 1926 is an american-born danish nuclear physicist he won the 1975 nobel prize in physics for his work on the non-spherical geometry of atomic nuclei


 early life 
mottelson was born in chicago illinois the son of georgia blum and goodman mottelson an engineer he graduated from lyons township high school in lagrange illinois he received a bachelors degree from purdue university in 1947 and a phd in nuclear physics from harvard university in 1950


 career 
he moved to institute for theoretical physics later the niels bohr institute in copenhagen on the sheldon traveling fellowship from harvard and remained in denmark in 1953 he was appointed staff member in cerns theoretical study group which was based in copenhagen a position he held until he became professor at the newly formed nordic institute for theoretical physics nordita in 1957 he was a visiting professor at the university of california berkeley in spring 1959 in 1971 he became a naturalized danish citizen
in 1950–51 james rainwater and aage bohr had developed models of the atomic nucleus which began to take into account the behaviour of the individual nucleons these models which moved beyond the simpler liquid drop treatment of the nucleus as having effectively no internal structure were the first models which could explain a number of nuclear properties including the non-spherical distribution of charge in certain nuclei mottelson worked with aage bohr to compare the theoretical models with experimental data in three papers which were published in 1952–53 bohr and mottelson demonstrated close agreement between theory and experiment for example showing that the energy levels of certain nuclei could be described by a rotation spectrum this work stimulated new theoretical and experimental studies


 nobel prize 1975 
rainwater bohr and mottelson were jointly awarded the 1975 nobel prize in physics for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection


 post-nobel prize work 
bohr and mottelson continued to work together publishing a two-volume monograph nuclear structure the first volume single-particle motion appeared in 1969 and the second volume nuclear deformations in 1975
professor mottelson is a member of the board of sponsors of the bulletin of the atomic scientists
he is a foreign fellow of bangladesh academy of sciences and the norwegian academy of science and letters in 1969 he received the atoms for peace award he acted as director of ect trento italy from 1993 to 1997


 personal life 
mottelson has dual citizenship he has both danish and american citizenship he lives in copenhagen denmark mottelson was married to nancy jane reno from 1948 until her death in 1975 they had two sons and one daughter mottelson then married britta marger siegumfeldt in 1983
