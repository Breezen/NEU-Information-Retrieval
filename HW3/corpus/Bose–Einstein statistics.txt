in quantum statistics bose–einstein statistics or more colloquially b–e statistics is one of two possible ways in which a collection of non-interacting indistinguishable particles may occupy a set of available discrete energy states at thermodynamic equilibrium the aggregation of particles in the same state which is a characteristic of particles obeying bose–einstein statistics accounts for the cohesive streaming of laser light and the frictionless creeping of superfluid helium the theory of this behaviour was developed 1924–25 by satyendra nath bose who recognized that a collection of identical and indistinguishable particles can be distributed in this way the idea was later adopted and extended by albert einstein in collaboration with bose
the bose–einstein statistics apply only to those particles not limited to single occupancy of the same state—that is particles that do not obey the pauli exclusion principle restrictions such particles have integer values of spin and are named bosons after the statistics that correctly describe their behaviour there must also be no significant interaction between the particles


 concept 
at low temperatures bosons behave differently from fermions which obey the fermi–dirac statistics in a way that an unlimited number of them can condense into the same energy state this apparently unusual property also gives rise to the special state of matter – the bose–einstein condensate fermi–dirac and bose–einstein statistics apply when quantum effects are important and the particles are indistinguishable quantum effects appear if the concentration of particles satisfies

where n is the number of particles v is the volume and nq is the quantum concentration for which the interparticle distance is equal to the thermal de broglie wavelength so that the wavefunctions of the particles are barely overlapping
fermi–dirac statistics apply to fermions particles that obey the pauli exclusion principle and bose–einstein statistics apply to bosons as the quantum concentration depends on temperature most systems at high temperatures obey the classical maxwell–boltzmann limit unless they also have a very high density as for a white dwarf both fermi–dirac and bose–einstein become maxwell–boltzmann statistics at high temperature or at low concentration
b–e statistics was introduced for photons in 1924 by bose and generalized to atoms by einstein in 1924–25

 history 
while presenting a lecture at the university of dhaka in what was then british india and now bangladesh on the theory of radiation and the ultraviolet catastrophe satyendra nath bose intended to show his students that the contemporary theory was inadequate because it predicted results not in accordance with experimental results during this lecture bose committed an error in applying the theory which unexpectedly gave a prediction that agreed with the experiment the error was a simple mistake—similar to arguing that flipping two fair coins will produce two heads one-third of the time—that would appear obviously wrong to anyone with a basic understanding of statistics remarkably this error resembled the famous blunder by dalembert known from his croix ou pile article however the results it predicted agreed with experiment and bose realized it might not be a mistake after all for the first time he took the position that the maxwell–boltzmann distribution would not be true for all microscopic particles at all scales thus he studied the probability of finding particles in various states in phase space where each state is a little patch having volume h3 and the position and momentum of the particles are not kept particularly separate but are considered as one variable
bose adapted this lecture into a short article called plancks law and the hypothesis of light quanta and submitted it to the philosophical magazine however the referees report was negative and the paper was rejected undaunted he sent the manuscript to albert einstein requesting publication in the zeitschrift für physik einstein immediately agreed personally translated the article from english into german bose had earlier translated einsteins article on the theory of general relativity from german to english and saw to it that it was published boses theory achieved respect when einstein sent his own paper in support of boses to zeitschrift für physik asking that they be published together this was done in 1924
the reason bose produced accurate results was that since photons are indistinguishable from each other one cannot treat any two photons having equal energy as being two distinct identifiable photons by analogy if in an alternate universe coins were to behave like photons and other bosons the probability of producing two heads would indeed be one-third and so is the probability of getting a head and a tail which equals one-half for the conventional classical distinguishable coins boses error leads to what is now called bose–einstein statistics
bose and einstein extended the idea to atoms and this led to the prediction of the existence of phenomena which became known as bose–einstein condensate a dense collection of bosons which are particles with integer spin named after bose which was demonstrated to exist by experiment in 1995


 two derivations of the bose–einstein distribution 


 derivation from the grand canonical ensemble 
the bose–einstein distribution which applies only to a quantum system of non-interacting bosons is easily derived from the grand canonical ensemble in this ensemble the system is able to exchange energy and exchange particles with a reservoir temperature t and chemical potential μ fixed by the reservoir
due to the non-interacting quality each available single-particle level with energy level ε forms a separate thermodynamic system in contact with the reservoir in other words each single-particle level is a separate tiny grand canonical ensemble with bosons there is no limit on the number of particles n in the level but due to indistinguishability each possible n corresponds to only one microstate with energy nε the resulting partition function for that single-particle level therefore forms a geometric series

this result applies for each single-particle level and thus forms the bose–einstein distribution for the entire state of the system
the variance in particle number due to thermal fluctuations may also be derived

   this is because the probability distribution for the number of bosons in a given energy level is a geometric distribution not a poisson distribution


 derivation in the canonical approach 
it is also possible to derive approximate bose–einstein statistics in the canonical ensemble these derivations are lengthy and only yield the above results in the asymptotic limit of a large number of particles the reason is that the total number of bosons is fixed in the canonical ensemble the bose–einstein distribution in this case can be derived as in most texts by maximization but the mathematically best derivation is by the darwin–fowler method of mean values as emphasized by dingle see also müller-kirsten the fluctuations of the ground state in the condensed region are however markedly different in the canonical and grand-canonical ensembles


 interdisciplinary applications 
viewed as a pure probability distribution the bose–einstein distribution has found application in other fields
in recent years bose einstein statistics have also been used as a method for term weighting in information retrieval the method is one of a collection of dfr divergence from randomness models the basic notion being that bose einstein statistics may be a useful indicator in cases where a particular term and a particular document have a significant relationship that would not have occurred purely by chance source code for implementing this model is available from the terrier project at the university of glasgow

the evolution of many complex systems including the world wide web business and citation networks is encoded in the dynamic web describing the interactions between the systems constituents despite their irreversible and nonequilibrium nature these networks follow bose statistics and can undergo bose–einstein condensation addressing the dynamical properties of these nonequilibrium systems within the framework of equilibrium quantum gases predicts that the first-mover-advantage fit-get-richfgr and winner-takes-all phenomena observed in competitive systems are thermodynamically distinct phases of the underlying evolving networks
