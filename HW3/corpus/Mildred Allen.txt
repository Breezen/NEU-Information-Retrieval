for nearly 20 years starting in the early 1960s allen collaborated with erwin saxl an industrial physicist living in harvard massachusetts on experiments with a torsion pendulum allen and saxl reported anomalous changes in the period of a torsion pendulum during a solar eclipse in 1970 and hypothesized that “gravitational theory needs to be modified” their measurements and similar anomalies earlier observed by allais using a paraconical pendulum have not been accepted by the physics community as in need of unconventional explanation and subsequent experiments have not succeeded in reproducing the results
