 observations 
observing the eclipse from carrickfergus ireland dr john wybard wrote in latin
luna momento quasi et eximproviso totam se intra disci solis orbitam seu ambitum quatenus conspectui nostro appareret tam agiliter injiciebat ut circumagere aut circumvolutare videretur sicut catillus seu lapis molaris superior sole tunc circum-circa ejus limbum seu marginem splendidulo vel corusco apparente”
the moon as if at that moment and unexpectedly threw itself so very nimbly between the entire path or circuit of the sun’s disc in so far as it appeared to our sight so that it seemed to move in a circle or roll around like a plate or upper mill-stone with the sun glowing or rather shimmering all around its rim or edge
because this eclipse occurred on a monday that day became popularly known as mirk monday
