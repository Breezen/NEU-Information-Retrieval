agnosticism is the view that the existence of god of the divine or the supernatural is unknown or unknowable
according to the philosopher william l rowe agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that god exists or the belief that god does not exist agnosticism is the doctrine or tenet of agnostics with regard to the existence of anything beyond and behind material phenomena or to knowledge of a first cause or god and is not a religion
english biologist thomas henry huxley coined the word agnostic in 1869 earlier thinkers however had written works that promoted agnostic points of view such as sanjaya belatthaputta a 5th-century bce indian philosopher who expressed agnosticism about any afterlife and protagoras a 5th-century bce greek philosopher who expressed agnosticism about the existence of the gods the nasadiya sukta in the rigveda is agnostic about the origin of the universe


 defining agnosticism 

agnosticism is of the essence of science whether ancient or modern it simply means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that which he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe consequently agnosticism puts aside not only the greater part of popular theology but also the greater part of anti-theology on the whole the bosh of heterodoxy is more offensive to me than that of orthodoxy because heterodoxy professes to be guided by reason and science and orthodoxy does not

that which agnostics deny and repudiate as immoral is the contrary doctrine that there are propositions which men ought to believe without logically satisfactory evidence and that reprobation ought to attach to the profession of disbelief in such inadequately supported propositions

agnosticism in fact is not a creed but a method the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle  positively the principle may be expressed in matters of the intellect follow your reason as far as it will take you without regard to any other consideration and negatively in matters of the intellect do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable

being a scientist above all else huxley presented agnosticism as a form of demarcation a hypothesis with no supporting objective testable evidence is not an objective scientific claim as such there would be no way to test said hypotheses leaving the results inconclusive his agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth or falsehood of the claim at hand karl popper would also describe himself as an agnostic according to philosopher william l rowe in this strict sense agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that god exists or the belief that god does not exist
george h smith while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word promoted broadening the definition of atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism the view of those who do not believe in the existence of any deity but do not claim to know if a deity does or does not exist and agnostic theism the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of any deity but still believe in such an existence


 etymology 
agnostic from ancient greek ἀ- a- meaning without and γνῶσισ gnōsis meaning knowledge was used by thomas henry huxley in a speech at a meeting of the metaphysical society in 1869 to describe his philosophy which rejects all claims of spiritual or mystical knowledge
early christian church leaders used the greek word gnosis knowledge to describe spiritual knowledge agnosticism is not to be confused with religious views opposing the ancient religious movement of gnosticism in particular huxley used the term in a broader more abstract sense huxley identified agnosticism not as a creed but rather as a method of skeptical evidence-based inquiry
in recent years scientific literature dealing with neuroscience and psychology has used the word to mean not knowable in technical and marketing literature agnostic can also mean independence from some parameters—for example platform agnostic or hardware agnostic


 qualifying agnosticism 
scottish enlightenment philosopher david hume contended that meaningful statements about the universe are always qualified by some degree of doubt he asserted that the fallibility of human beings means that they cannot obtain absolute certainty except in trivial cases where a statement is true by definition eg tautologies such as all bachelors are unmarried or all triangles have three corners


 types 
strong agnosticism also called hard closed strict or permanent agnosticism
the view that the question of the existence or nonexistence of a deity or deities and the nature of ultimate reality is unknowable by reason of our natural inability to verify any experience with anything but another subjective experience a strong agnostic would say i cannot know whether a deity exists or not and neither can you
weak agnosticism also called soft open empirical or temporal agnosticism
the view that the existence or nonexistence of any deities is currently unknown but is not necessarily unknowable therefore one will withhold judgment until evidence if any becomes available a weak agnostic would say i dont know whether any deities exist or not but maybe one day if there is evidence we can find something out
apathetic agnosticism
the view that no amount of debate can prove or disprove the existence of one or more deities and if one or more deities exist they do not appear to be concerned about the fate of humans therefore their existence has little to no impact on personal human affairs and should be of little interest


 history 


 hindu philosophy 

throughout the history of hinduism there has been a strong tradition of philosophic speculation and skepticism
the rig veda takes an agnostic view on the fundamental question of how the universe and the gods were created nasadiya sukta creation hymn in the tenth chapter of the rig veda says


 hume kant and kierkegaard 
aristotle anselm aquinas and descartes presented arguments attempting to rationally prove the existence of god the skeptical empiricism of david hume the antinomies of immanuel kant and the existential philosophy of søren kierkegaard convinced many later philosophers to abandon these attempts regarding it impossible to construct any unassailable proof for the existence or non-existence of god
in his 1844 book philosophical fragments kierkegaard writes

let us call this unknown something god it is nothing more than a name we assign to it the idea of demonstrating that this unknown something god exists could scarcely suggest itself to reason for if god does not exist it would of course be impossible to prove it and if he does exist it would be folly to attempt it for at the very outset in beginning my proof i would have presupposed it not as doubtful but as certain a presupposition is never doubtful for the very reason that it is a presupposition since otherwise i would not begin readily understanding that the whole would be impossible if he did not exist but if when i speak of proving gods existence i mean that i propose to prove that the unknown which exists is god then i express myself unfortunately for in that case i do not prove anything least of all an existence but merely develop the content of a conception

hume was huxleys favourite philosopher calling him the prince of agnostics diderot wrote to his mistress telling of a visit by hume to the baron dholbach and describing how a word for the position that huxley would later describe as agnosticism didnt seem to exist or at least wasnt common knowledge at the time

the first time that m hume found himself at the table of the baron he was seated beside him i dont know for what purpose the english philosopher took it into his head to remark to the baron that he did not believe in atheists that he had never seen any the baron said to him count how many we are here we are eighteen the baron added it isnt too bad a showing to be able to point out to you fifteen at once the three others havent made up their minds


 charles darwin 

raised in a religious environment charles darwin studied to be an anglican clergyman while eventually doubting parts of his faith darwin continued to help in church affairs even while avoiding church attendance darwin stated that it would be absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent theist and an evolutionist although reticent about his religious views in 1879 he wrote that i have never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a god – i think that generally  an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind


 thomas henry huxley 

agnostic views are as old as philosophical skepticism but the terms agnostic and agnosticism were created by huxley to sum up his thoughts on contemporary developments of metaphysics about the unconditioned william hamilton and the unknowable herbert spencer though huxley began to use the term agnostic in 1869 his opinions had taken shape some time before that date in a letter of september 23 1860 to charles kingsley huxley discussed his views extensively

i neither affirm nor deny the immortality of man i see no reason for believing it but on the other hand i have no means of disproving it i have no a priori objections to the doctrine no man who has to deal daily and hourly with nature can trouble himself about a priori difficulties give me such evidence as would justify me in believing in anything else and i will believe that why should i not it is not half so wonderful as the conservation of force or the indestructibility of matter 
it is no use to talk to me of analogies and probabilities i know what i mean when i say i believe in the law of the inverse squares and i will not rest my life and my hopes upon weaker convictions 
that my personality is the surest thing i know may be true but the attempt to conceive what it is leads me into mere verbal subtleties i have champed up all that chaff about the ego and the non-ego noumena and phenomena and all the rest of it too often not to know that in attempting even to think of these questions the human intellect flounders at once out of its depth

and again to the same correspondent may 6 1863

i have never had the least sympathy with the a priori reasons against orthodoxy and i have by nature and disposition the greatest possible antipathy to all the atheistic and infidel school nevertheless i know that i am in spite of myself exactly what the christian would call and so far as i can see is justified in calling atheist and infidel i cannot see one shadow or tittle of evidence that the great unknown underlying the phenomenon of the universe stands to us in the relation of a father who loves us and cares for us as christianity asserts so with regard to the other great christian dogmas immortality of soul and future state of rewards and punishments what possible objection can i—who am compelled perforce to believe in the immortality of what we call matter and force and in a very unmistakable present state of rewards and punishments for our deeds—have to these doctrines give me a scintilla of evidence and i am ready to jump at them

of the origin of the name agnostic to describe this attitude huxley gave the following account

when i reached intellectual maturity and began to ask myself whether i was an atheist a theist or a pantheist a materialist or an idealist christian or a freethinker i found that the more i learned and reflected the less ready was the answer until at last i came to the conclusion that i had neither art nor part with any of these denominations except the last the one thing in which most of these good people were agreed was the one thing in which i differed from them they were quite sure they had attained a certain gnosis–had more or less successfully solved the problem of existence while i was quite sure i had not and had a pretty strong conviction that the problem was insoluble and with hume and kant on my side i could not think myself presumptuous in holding fast by that opinion 
so i took thought and invented what i conceived to be the appropriate title of agnostic it came into my head as suggestively antithetic to the gnostic of church history who professed to know so much about the very things of which i was ignorant  to my great satisfaction the term took

in 1889 huxley wrote

therefore although it be as i believe demonstrable that we have no real knowledge of the authorship or of the date of composition of the gospels as they have come down to us and that nothing better than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject


 robert g ingersoll 

robert g ingersoll an illinois lawyer and politician who evolved into a well-known and sought-after orator in 19th-century america has been referred to as the great agnostic
in an 1896 lecture titled why i am an agnostic ingersoll related why he was an agnostic

is there a supernatural power—an arbitrary mind—an enthroned god—a supreme will that sways the tides and currents of the world—to which all causes bow i do not deny i do not know—but i do not believe i believe that the natural is supreme—that from the infinite chain no link can be lost or broken—that there is no supernatural power that can answer prayer—no power that worship can persuade or change—no power that cares for man
i believe that with infinite arms nature embraces the all—that there is no interference—no chance—that behind every event are the necessary and countless causes and that beyond every event will be and must be the necessary and countless effects
is there a god i do not know is man immortal i do not know one thing i do know and that is that neither hope nor fear belief nor denial can change the fact it is as it is and it will be as it must be

in the conclusion of the speech he simply sums up the agnostic position as

we can be as honest as we are ignorant if we are when asked what is beyond the horizon of the known we must say that we do not know


 william stewart ross 
william stewart ross wrote under the name of saladin he championed agnosticism in opposition to the atheism of charles bradlaugh as an open-ended spiritual exploration in why i am an agnostic c 1889 he claims that agnosticism is the very reverse of atheism


 bertrand russell 

bertrand russells pamphlet why i am not a christian based on a speech delivered in 1927 and later included in a book of the same title is considered a classic statement of agnosticism he calls upon his readers to stand on their own two feet and look fair and square at the world with a fearless attitude and a free intelligence
in 1939 russell gave a lecture on the existence and nature of god in which he characterized himself as an atheist he said

the existence and nature of god is a subject of which i can discuss only half if one arrives at a negative conclusion concerning the first part of the question the second part of the question does not arise and my position as you may have gathered is a negative one on this matter

however later in the same lecture discussing modern non-anthropomorphic concepts of god russell states

that sort of god is i think not one that can actually be disproved as i think the omnipotent and benevolent creator can

in russells 1947 pamphlet am i an atheist or an agnostic subtitled a plea for tolerance in the face of new dogmas he ruminates on the problem of what to call himself

as a philosopher if i were speaking to a purely philosophic audience i should say that i ought to describe myself as an agnostic because i do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one can prove that there is not a god on the other hand if i am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street i think i ought to say that i am an atheist because when i say that i cannot prove that there is not a god i ought to add equally that i cannot prove that there are not the homeric gods

in his 1953 essay what is an agnostic russell states

an agnostic thinks it impossible to know the truth in matters such as god and the future life with which christianity and other religions are concerned or if not impossible at least impossible at the present time
are agnostics atheists
no an atheist like a christian holds that we can know whether or not there is a god the christian holds that we can know there is a god the atheist that we can know there is not the agnostic suspends judgment saying that there are not sufficient grounds either for affirmation or for denial

later in the essay russell adds

i think that if i heard a voice from the sky predicting all that was going to happen to me during the next twenty-four hours including events that would have seemed highly improbable and if all these events then produced to happen i might perhaps be convinced at least of the existence of some superhuman intelligence


 leslie weatherhead 

in 1965 christian theologian leslie weatherhead published the christian agnostic in which he argues

 many professing agnostics are nearer belief in the true god than are many conventional church-goers who believe in a body that does not exist whom they miscall god

although radical and unpalatable to conventional theologians weatherheads agnosticism falls far short of huxleys and short even of weak agnosticism

of course the human soul will always have the power to reject god for choice is essential to its nature but i cannot believe that anyone will finally do this


 demographics 

demographic research services normally do not differentiate between various types of non-religious respondents so agnostics are often classified in the same category as atheists or other non-religious people
a 2010 survey published in encyclopædia britannica found that the non-religious people or the agnostics made up about 9.6% of the worlds population a november–december 2006 poll published in the financial times gives rates for the united states and five european countries the rates of agnosticism in the united states were at 14 while the rates of agnosticism in the european countries surveyed were considerably higher italy 20 spain 30 great britain 35 germany 25 and france 32
a study conducted by the pew research center found that about 16% of the worlds people the third largest group after christianity and islam have no religious affiliation according to a 2012 report by the pew research center agnostics made up 3.3% of the us adult population in the us religious landscape survey conducted by the pew research center 55% of agnostic respondents expressed a belief in god or a universal spirit whereas 41% stated that they thought that they felt a tension being non-religious in a society where most people are religious

according to the 2011 australian bureau of statistics 22% of australians have no religion a category that includes agnostics between 64% and 65% of japanese and up to 81% of vietnamese are atheists agnostics or do not believe in a god an official european union survey reported that 3% of the eu population is unsure about their belief in a god or spirit


 criticism 
agnosticism is criticized from a variety of standpoints some religious thinkers see agnosticism as limiting the minds capacity to know reality to materialism some atheists criticize the use of the term agnosticism as functionally indistinguishable from atheism this results in frequent criticisms of those who adopt the term as avoiding the atheist label


 theistic 
theistic critics claim that agnosticism is impossible in practice since a person can live only either as if god did not exist etsi deus non-daretur or as if god did exist etsi deus daretur
religious scholars such as laurence b brown criticize the misuse of the word agnosticism claiming that it has become one of the most misapplied terms in metaphysics brown raises the question you claim that nothing can be known with certainty  how then can you be so sure


 christian 
according to pope benedict xvi strong agnosticism in particular contradicts itself in affirming the power of reason to know scientific truth he blames the exclusion of reasoning from religion and ethics for dangerous pathologies such as crimes against humanity and ecological disasters agnosticism said ratzinger is always the fruit of a refusal of that knowledge which is in fact offered to man  the knowledge of god has always existed he asserted that agnosticism is a choice of comfort pride dominion and utility over truth and is opposed by the following attitudes the keenest self-criticism humble listening to the whole of existence the persistent patience and self-correction of the scientific method a readiness to be purified by the truth
the catholic church sees merit in examining what it calls partial agnosticism specifically those systems that do not aim at constructing a complete philosophy of the unknowable but at excluding special kinds of truth notably religious from the domain of knowledge however the church is historically opposed to a full denial of the capacity of human reason to know god the council of the vatican declares god the beginning and end of all can by the natural light of human reason be known with certainty from the works of creation
blaise pascal argued that even if there were truly no evidence for god agnostics should consider what is now known as pascals wager the infinite expected value of acknowledging god is always greater than the finite expected value of not acknowledging his existence and thus it is a safer bet to choose god
peter kreeft and ronald tacelli cited 20 arguments for gods existence asserting that any demand for evidence testable in a laboratory is in effect asking god the supreme being to become mans servant


 atheistic 
according to richard dawkins a distinction between agnosticism and atheism is unwieldy and depends on how close to zero a person is willing to rate the probability of existence for any given god-like entity about himself dawkins continues i am agnostic only to the extent that i am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden dawkins also identifies two categories of agnostics temporary agnostics in practice taps and permanent agnostics in principle paps he states that agnosticism about the existence of god belongs firmly in the temporary or tap category either he exists or he doesnt it is a scientific question one day we may know the answer and meanwhile we can say something pretty strong about the probability and considers pap a deeply inescapable kind of fence-sitting


 related concepts 
ignosticism is the view that a coherent definition of a deity must be put forward before the question of the existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed if the chosen definition is not coherent the ignostic holds the noncognitivist view that the existence of a deity is meaningless or empirically untestable
aj ayer theodore drange and other philosophers see both atheism and agnosticism as incompatible with ignosticism on the grounds that atheism and agnosticism accept a deity exists as a meaningful proposition that can be argued for or against
