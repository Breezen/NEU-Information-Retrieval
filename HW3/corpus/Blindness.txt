visual impairment also known as vision impairment or vision loss is a decreased ability to see to a degree that causes problems not fixable by usual means such as glasses some also include those who have a decreased ability to see because they do not have access to glasses or contact lenses visual impairment is often defined as a best corrected visual acuity of worse than either 20/40 or 20/60 the term blindness is used for complete or nearly complete vision loss visual impairment may cause people difficulties with normal daily activities such as driving reading socializing and walking
the most common causes of visual impairment globally are uncorrected refractive errors 43 cataracts 33 and glaucoma 2 refractive errors include near sighted far sighted presbyopia and astigmatism cataracts are the most common cause of blindness other disorders that may cause visual problems include age related macular degeneration diabetic retinopathy corneal clouding childhood blindness and a number of infections visual impairment can also be caused by problems in the brain due to stroke premature birth or trauma among others these cases are known as cortical visual impairment screening for vision problems in children may improve future vision and educational achievement screening adults without symptoms is of uncertain benefit diagnosis is by an eye exam
the world health organization who estimates that 80% of visual impairment is either preventable or curable with treatment this includes cataracts the infections river blindness and trachoma glaucoma diabetic retinopathy uncorrected refractive errors and some cases of childhood blindness many people with significant visual impairment benefit from vision rehabilitation changes in their environment and assistive devices
as of 2015 there were 940 million people with some degree of vision loss 246 million had low vision and 39 million were blind the majority of people with poor vision are in the developing world and are over the age of 50 years rates of visual impairment have decreased since the 1990s visual impairments have considerable economic costs both directly due to the cost of treatment and indirectly due to decreased ability to work


 classification 

the definition of visual impairment is reduced vision not corrected by glasses or contact lenses the world health organization uses the following classifications of visual impairment when the vision in the better eye with best possible glasses correction is
20/30 to 20/60  is considered mild vision loss or near-normal vision
20/70 to 20/160  is considered moderate visual impairment or moderate low vision
20/200 to 20/400  is considered severe visual impairment or severe low vision
20/500 to 20/1,000  is considered profound visual impairment or profound low vision
more than 20/1,000  is considered near-total visual impairment or near total blindness
no light perception  is considered total visual impairment or total blindness
blindness is defined by the world health organization as vision in a persons best eye with best correction of less than 20/500 or a visual field of less than 10 degrees this definition was set in 1972 and there is ongoing discussion as to whether it should be altered to officially include uncorrected refractive errors


 united kingdom 
severely sight impaired
defined as having central visual acuity of less than 3/60 with normal fields of vision or gross visual field restriction
unable to see at 3 metres what the normally sighted person sees at 60 m
sight impaired
able to see at 3 m but not at 6 m what the normally sighted person sees at 60 m
less severe visual impairment is not captured by registration data and its prevalence is difficult to quantify
low vision
a visual acuity of less than 6/18 but greater than 3/60
not eligible to drive and may have difficulty recognising faces across a street watching television or choosing clean unstained co-ordinated clothing
in the uk the certificate of vision impairment cvi is used to certify patients as severely sight impaired or sight impaired the accompanying guidance for clinical staff states the national assistance act 1948 states that a person can be certified as severely sight impaired if they are so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which eye sight is essential the test is whether a person cannot do any work for which eyesight is essential not just his or her normal job or one particular job
in practice the definition depends on individuals visual acuity and the extent to which their field of vision is restricted the department of health identifies three groups of people who may be classified as severely visually impaired
those below 3/60 equivalent to 20/400 in us notation snellen most people below 3/60 are severely sight impaired
those better than 3/60 but below 6/60 snellen people who have a very contracted field of vision only
those 6/60 snellen or above people in this group who have a contracted field of vision especially if the contraction is in the lower part of the field
the department of health also state that a person is more likely to be classified as severely visually impaired if their eyesight has failed recently or if they are an older individual both groups being perceived as less able to adapt to their vision loss


 united states 
in the united states any person with vision that cannot be corrected to better than 20/200 in the best eye or who has 20 degrees diameter or less of visual field remaining is considered legally blind or eligible for disability classification and possible inclusion in certain government sponsored programs
in the united states the terms partially sighted low vision legally blind and totally blind are used by schools colleges and other educational institutions to describe students with visual impairments they are defined as follows
partially sighted indicates some type of visual problem with a need of person to receive special education in some cases
low vision generally refers to a severe visual impairment not necessarily limited to distance vision low vision applies to all individuals with sight who are unable to read the newspaper at a normal viewing distance even with the aid of eyeglasses or contact lenses they use a combination of vision and other senses to learn although they may require adaptations in lighting or the size of print and sometimes braille
myopic – unable to see distant objects clearly commonly called near-sighted or short-sighted
hyperopic – unable to see close objects clearly commonly called far-sighted or long-sighted

legally blind indicates that a person has less than 20/200 vision in the better eye after best correction contact lenses or glasses or a field of vision of less than 20 degrees in the better eye
totally blind students learn via braille or other non-visual media
in 1934 the american medical association adopted the following definition of blindness

central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with corrective glasses or central visual acuity of more than 20/200 if there is a visual field defect in which the peripheral field is contracted to such an extent that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angular distance no greater than 20 degrees in the better eye

the united states congress included this definition as part of the aid to the blind program in the social security act passed in 1935 in 1972 the aid to the blind program and two others combined under title xvi of the social security act to form the supplemental security income program which states

an individual shall be considered to be blind for purposes of this title if he has central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the use of a correcting lens an eye which is accompanied by a limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees shall be considered for purposes of the first sentence of this subsection as having a central visual acuity of 20/200 or less an individual shall also be considered to be blind for purposes of this title if he is blind as defined under a state plan approved under title x or xvi as in effect for october 1972 and received aid under such plan on the basis of blindness for december 1973 so long as he is continuously blind as so defined


 other 
kuwait is one of many nations that share the 6/60 criteria for legal blindness


 health effects 
visual impairments may take many forms and be of varying degrees visual acuity alone is not always a good predictor of the degree of problems a person may have someone with relatively good acuity eg 20/40 can have difficulty with daily functioning while someone with worse acuity eg 20/200 may function reasonably well if their visual demands are not great
the american medical association has estimated that the loss of one eye equals 25% impairment of the visual system and 24% impairment of the whole person total loss of vision in both eyes is considered to be 100% visual impairment and 85% impairment of the whole person
some people who fall into this category can use their considerable residual vision – their remaining sight – to complete daily tasks without relying on alternative methods the role of a low vision specialist optometrist or ophthalmologist is to maximize the functional level of a patients vision by optical or non-optical means primarily this is by use of magnification in the form of telescopic systems for distance vision and optical or electronic magnification for near tasks
people with significantly reduced acuity may benefit from training conducted by individuals trained in the provision of technical aids low vision rehabilitation professionals some of whom are connected to an agency for the blind can provide advice on lighting and contrast to maximize remaining vision these professionals also have access to non-visual aids and can instruct patients in their uses
the subjects making the most use of rehabilitation instruments who lived alone and preserved their own mobility and occupation were the least depressed with the lowest risk of suicide and the highest level of social integration
those with worsening sight and the prognosis of eventual blindness are at comparatively high risk of suicide and thus may be in need of supportive services these observations advocate the establishment and extension of therapeutic and preventative programs to include patients with impending and current severe visual impairment who do not qualify for services for the blind ophthalmologists should be made aware of these potential consequences and incorporate a place for mental health professionals in their treatment of these types of patients with a view to preventing the onset of depressive symptomatology avoiding self-destructive behavior and improving the quality of life of these patients such intervention should occur in the early stages of diagnosis particularly as many studies have demonstrated how rapid acceptance of the serious visual handicap has led to a better more productive compliance with rehabilitation programs moreover psychological distress has been reported and is exemplified by our psychological autopsy study to be at its highest when sight loss is not complete but the prognosis is unfavorable.10 therefore early intervention is imperative for enabling successful psychological adjustment


 associated problems 
blindness can occur in combination with such conditions as intellectual disability autism spectrum disorders cerebral palsy hearing impairments and epilepsy blindness in combination with hearing loss is known as deafblindness
it has been estimated that over half of completely blind people have non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder a condition in which a persons circadian rhythm normally slightly longer than 24 hours is not entrained synchronized to the lightdark cycle


 cause 
the most common causes of visual impairment globally in 2010 were
refractive error 42
cataract 33
glaucoma 2
age related macular degeneration 1
corneal opacification 1
diabetic retinopathy 1
childhood blindness
trachoma 1
undetermined 18
the most common causes of blindness in 2010 were
cataracts 51
glaucoma 8
age related macular degeneration 5
corneal opacification 4
childhood blindness 4
refractive errors 3
trachoma 3
diabetic retinopathy 1
undetermined 21
about 90% of people who are visually impaired live in the developing world age-related macular degeneration glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy are the leading causes of blindness in the developed world
among working age adults who are newly blind in england and wales the most common causes in 2010 were
hereditary retinal disorders 20.2
diabetic retinopathy 14.4
optic atrophy 14.1
glaucoma 5.9
congenital abnormalities 5.1
disorders of the visual cortex 4.1
cerebrovascular disease 3.2
degeneration of the macula and posterior pole 3.0
myopia 2.8
corneal disorders 2.6
malignant neoplasms of the brain and nervous system 1.5
retinal detachment 1.4


 cataracts 
of these cataract is responsible for 65 or more than 22 million cases of blindness and glaucoma is responsible for 6 million cases
cataracts is the congenital and pediatric pathology that describes the greying or opacity of the crystalline lens which is most commonly caused by intrauterine infections metabolic disorders and genetically transmitted syndromes cataracts are the leading cause of child and adult blindness that doubles in prevalence with every ten years after the age of 40 consequently today cataracts are more common among adults than in children that is people face higher chances of developing cataracts as they age nonetheless cataracts tend to have a greater financial and emotional toll upon children as they must undergo expensive diagnosis long term rehabilitation and visual assistance also according to the saudi journal for health sciences sometimes patients experience irreversible amblyopia after pediatric cataract surgery because the cataracts prevented the normal maturation of vision prior to operation despite the great progress in treatment cataracts remain a global problem in both economically developed and developing countries at present with the variant outcomes as well as the unequal access to cataract surgery the best way to reduce the risk of developing cataracts is to avoid smoking and extensive exposure to sun light ie uv-b rays


 glaucoma 
glaucoma is a congenital and pediatric eye disease characterized by increased pressure within the eye or intraocular pressure iop glaucoma causes visual field loss as well as severs the optic nerve early diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma in patients is imperative because glaucoma is triggered by non-specific levels of iop also another challenge in accurately diagnosing glaucoma is that the disease has four causes 1 inflammatory ocular hypertension syndrome iohs 2 severe uveitic angle closure 3 corticosteroid-induced and 4 a heterogonous mechanism associated with structural change and chronic inflammation in addition often pediatric glaucoma differs greatly in cause and management from the glaucoma developed by adults currently the best sign of pediatric glaucoma is an iop of 21 mm hg or greater present within a child one of the most common causes of pediatric glaucoma is cataract removal surgery which leads to an incidence rate of about 12.2% among infants and 58.7% among 10-year-olds


 infections 

childhood blindness can be caused by conditions related to pregnancy such as congenital rubella syndrome and retinopathy of prematurity leprosy and onchocerciasis each blind approximately 1 million individuals in the developing world
the number of individuals blind from trachoma has decreased in the past 10 years from 6 million to 1.3 million putting it in seventh place on the list of causes of blindness worldwide
central corneal ulceration is also a significant cause of monocular blindness worldwide accounting for an estimated 850,000 cases of corneal blindness every year in the indian subcontinent alone as a result corneal scarring from all causes is now the fourth greatest cause of global blindness


 injuries 

eye injuries most often occurring in people under 30 are the leading cause of monocular blindness vision loss in one eye throughout the united states injuries and cataracts affect the eye itself while abnormalities such as optic nerve hypoplasia affect the nerve bundle that sends signals from the eye to the back of the brain which can lead to decreased visual acuity
cortical blindness results from injuries to the occipital lobe of the brain that prevent the brain from correctly receiving or interpreting signals from the optic nerve symptoms of cortical blindness vary greatly across individuals and may be more severe in periods of exhaustion or stress it is common for people with cortical blindness to have poorer vision later in the day
blinding has been used as an act of vengeance and torture in some instances to deprive a person of a major sense by which they can navigate or interact within the world act fully independently and be aware of events surrounding them an example from the classical realm is oedipus who gouges out his own eyes after realizing that he fulfilled the awful prophecy spoken of him having crushed the bulgarians the byzantine emperor basil ii blinded as many as 15,000 prisoners taken in the battle before releasing them contemporary examples include the addition of methods such as acid throwing as a form of disfigurement


 genetic defects 
people with albinism often have vision loss to the extent that many are legally blind though few of them actually cannot see lebers congenital amaurosis can cause total blindness or severe sight loss from birth or early childhood
recent advances in mapping of the human genome have identified other genetic causes of low vision or blindness one such example is bardet-biedl syndrome


 poisoning 
rarely blindness is caused by the intake of certain chemicals a well-known example is methanol which is only mildly toxic and minimally intoxicating and breaks down into the substances formaldehyde and formic acid which in turn can cause blindness an array of other health complications and death when competing with ethanol for metabolism ethanol is metabolized first and the onset of toxicity is delayed methanol is commonly found in methylated spirits denatured ethyl alcohol to avoid paying taxes on selling ethanol intended for human consumption methylated spirits are sometimes used by alcoholics as a desperate and cheap substitute for regular ethanol alcoholic beverages


 other 
amblyopia is a category of vision loss or visual impairment that is caused by factors unrelated to refractive errors or coexisting ocular diseases amblyopia is the condition when a childs visual systems fail to mature normally because the child either suffers from a premature birth measles congenital nubella syndrome vitamin a deficiency or meningitis if left untreated during childhood amblyopia is currently incurable in adulthood because surgical treatment effectiveness changes as a child matures consequently amblyopia is the worlds leading cause of child monocular vision loss which is the damage or loss of vision in one eye in the best case scenario which is very rare properly treated amblyopia patients can regain 20/40 acuity
corneal opacification
degenerative myopia
diabetic retinopathy is one of the manifestation microvascular complications of diabetes which is characterized by blindness or reduced acuity that is diabetic retinopathy describes the retinal and vitreous hemorrhages or retinal capillary blockage caused by the increase of a1c which a measurement of blood glucose or sugar level in fact as a1c increases people tend to be at greater risk of developing diabetic retinopathy than developing other microvascular complications associated with diabetes eg chronic hyperglycemia diabetic neuropathy and diabetic nephropathy despite the fact that only 8% of adults 40 years and older experience vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy eg nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy or npdr and proliferative diabetic retinopathy or pdr this eye diseased accounted for 17% of cases of blindness in 2002
retinitis pigmentosa
retinopathy of prematurity the most common cause of blindness in infants worldwide in its most severe form rop causes retinal detachment with attendant visual loss treatment is aimed mainly at prevention via laser or avastin therapy
stargardts disease
uveitis is a group of 30 intraocular inflammatory diseases caused by infections systemic diseases organ-specific autoimmune processes cancer or trauma that is uveitis refers to a complex category of ocular diseases that can cause blindness if either left untreated or improperly diagnosed the current challenge of accurately diagnosing uveitis is that often the cause of a specific ocular inflammation is either unknown or multi-layered consequently about 3–10% uveitis victims in developed countries and about 25% of victims in the developing countries become blind from incorrect diagnosis and from ineffectual prescription of drugs antibiotics or steroids in addition uveitis is a diverse category of eye diseases that are subdivided as granulomatous or tumorous or non-granulomatous anterior intermediate posterior or pan uveitis in other words uveitis diseases tend to be classified by their anatomic location in the eye eg uveal tract retina or lens as well as can create complication that can cause cataracts glaucoma retinal damage age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy
xerophthalmia often due to vitamin a deficiency is estimated to affect 5 million children each year 500,000 develop active corneal involvement and half of these go blind


 diagnosis 

it is important that people be examined by someone specializing in low vision care prior to other rehabilitation training to rule out potential medical or surgical correction for the problem and to establish a careful baseline refraction and prescription of both normal and low vision glasses and optical aids only a doctor is qualified to evaluate visual functioning of a compromised visual system effectively the american medical association provides an approach to evaluating visual loss as it affects an individuals ability to perform activities of daily living
screening adults who have no symptoms is of uncertain benefit


 prevention 
the world health organization estimates that 80% of visual loss is either preventable or curable with treatment this includes cataracts onchocerciasis trachoma glaucoma diabetic retinopathy uncorrected refractive errors and some cases of childhood blindness the center for disease control and prevention estimates that half of blindness in the united states is preventable


 treatment 

aside from medical help various sources provide information rehabilitation education and work and social integration


 mobility 

many people with serious visual impairments can travel independently using a wide range of tools and techniques orientation and mobility specialists are professionals who are specifically trained to teach people with visual impairments how to travel safely confidently and independently in the home and the community these professionals can also help blind people to practice travelling on specific routes which they may use often such as the route from ones house to a convenience store becoming familiar with an environment or route can make it much easier for a blind person to navigate successfully
tools such as the white cane with a red tip – the international symbol of blindness – may also be used to improve mobility a long cane is used to extend the users range of touch sensation it is usually swung in a low sweeping motion across the intended path of travel to detect obstacles however techniques for cane travel can vary depending on the user andor the situation some visually impaired persons do not carry these kinds of canes opting instead for the shorter lighter identification id cane still others require a support cane the choice depends on the individuals vision motivation and other factors
a small number of people employ guide dogs to assist in mobility these dogs are trained to navigate around various obstacles and to indicate when it becomes necessary to go up or down a step however the helpfulness of guide dogs is limited by the inability of dogs to understand complex directions the human half of the guide dog team does the directing based upon skills acquired through previous mobility training in this sense the handler might be likened to an aircrafts navigator who must know how to get from one place to another and the dog to the pilot who gets them there safely
gps devices can also be used as a mobility aid such software can assist blind people with orientation and navigation but it is not a replacement for traditional mobility tools such as white canes and guide dogs
some blind people are skilled at echolocating silent objects simply by producing mouth clicks and listening to the returning echoes it has been shown that blind echolocation experts use what is normally the visual part of their brain to process the echoes
government actions are sometimes taken to make public places more accessible to blind people public transportation is freely available to the blind in many cities tactile paving and audible traffic signals can make it easier and safer for visually impaired pedestrians to cross streets in addition to making rules about who can and cannot use a cane some governments mandate the right-of-way be given to users of white canes or guide dogs


 reading and magnification 

most visually impaired people who are not totally blind read print either of a regular size or enlarged by magnification devices many also read large-print which is easier for them to read without such devices a variety of magnifying glasses some handheld and some on desktops can make reading easier for them
others read braille or the infrequently used moon type or rely on talking books and readers or reading machines which convert printed text to speech or braille they use computers with special hardware such as scanners and refreshable braille displays as well as software written specifically for the blind such as optical character recognition applications and screen readers
some people access these materials through agencies for the blind such as the national library service for the blind and physically handicapped in the united states the national library for the blind or the rnib in the united kingdom
closed-circuit televisions equipment that enlarges and contrasts textual items are a more high-tech alternative to traditional magnification devices
there are also over 100 radio reading services throughout the world that provide people with vision impairments with readings from periodicals over the radio the international association of audio information services provides links to all of these organizations


 computers 
access technology such as screen readers screen magnifiers and refreshable braille displays enable the blind to use mainstream computer applications and mobile phones the availability of assistive technology is increasing accompanied by concerted efforts to ensure the accessibility of information technology to all potential users including the blind later versions of microsoft windows include an accessibility wizard  magnifier for those with partial vision and microsoft narrator a simple screen reader linux distributions as live cds for the blind include oralux and adriane knoppix the latter developed in part by adriane knopper who has a visual impairment mac os also comes with a built-in screen reader called voiceover
the movement towards greater web accessibility is opening a far wider number of websites to adaptive technology making the web a more inviting place for visually impaired surfers
experimental approaches in sensory substitution are beginning to provide access to arbitrary live views from a camera
modified visual output that includes large print andor clear simple graphics can be of benefit to users with some residual vision


 other aids and techniques 

blind people may use talking equipment such as thermometers watches clocks scales calculators and compasses they may also enlarge or mark dials on devices such as ovens and thermostats to make them usable other techniques used by blind people to assist them in daily activities include
adaptations of coins and banknotes so that the value can be determined by touch for example
in some currencies such as the euro the pound sterling and the indian rupee the size of a note increases with its value
on us coins pennies and dimes and nickels and quarters are similar in size the larger denominations dimes and quarters have ridges along the sides historically used to prevent the shaving of precious metals from the coins which can now be used for identification
some currencies banknotes have a tactile feature to indicate denomination for example the canadian currency tactile feature is a system of raised dots in one corner based on braille cells but not standard braille
it is also possible to fold notes in different ways to assist recognition

labeling and tagging clothing and other personal items
placing different types of food at different positions on a dinner plate
marking controls of household appliances
most people once they have been visually impaired for long enough devise their own adaptive strategies in all areas of personal and professional management
for the blind there are books in braille audio-books and text-to-speech computer programs machines and e-book readers low vision people can make use of these tools as well as large-print reading materials and e-book readers that provide large font sizes
computers are important tools of integration for the visually impaired person they allow using standard or specific programs screen magnification and conversion of text into sound or touch braille line and are useful for all levels of visual handicap ocr scanners can in conjunction with text-to-speech software read the contents of books and documents aloud via computer vendors also build closed-circuit televisions that electronically magnify paper and even change its contrast and color for visually impaired users for more information consult assistive technology
in adults with low vision there is no conclusive evidence supporting one form of reading aid over another in several studies stand-based closed-circuit television and hand-held closed-circuit television allowed faster reading than optical aids while electronic aids may allow faster reading for individuals with low vision portability ease of use and affordability must be considered for people
children with low vision sometimes have reading delays but do benefit from phonics-based beginning reading instruction methods engaging phonics instruction is multisensory highly motivating and hands-on typically students are first taught the most frequent sounds of the alphabet letters especially the so-called short vowel sounds then taught to blend sounds together with three-letter consonant-vowel-consonant words such as cat red sit hot sun hands-on or kinesthetically appealing very enlarged print materials such as those found in the big collection of phonics flipbooks by lynn gordon scholastic 2010 are helpful for teaching word families and blending skills to beginning readers with low vision beginning reading instructional materials should focus primarily on the lower-case letters not the capital letters even though they are larger because reading text requires familiarity mostly with lower-case letters phonics-based beginning reading should also be supplemented with phonemic awareness lessons writing opportunities and lots of read-alouds literature read to children daily to stimulate motivation vocabulary development concept development and comprehension skill development many children with low vision can be successfully included in regular education environments parents may need to be vigilant to ensure that the school provides the teacher and students with appropriate low vision resources for example technology in the classroom classroom aide time modified educational materials and consultation assistance with low vision experts


 communication 
communication with the visually impaired can be more difficult than communicating with someone who doesnt have vision loss however many people are uncomfortable with communicating with the blind and this can cause communication barriers one of the biggest obstacles in communicating with visually impaired individuals comes from face-to-face interactions there are many factors that can cause the sighted to become uncomfortable while communicating face to face there are many non-verbal factors that hinder communication between the visually impaired and the sighted more often than verbal factors do these factors which rivka bialistock mentions in her article include
lack of facial expressions mimics or body gesturesresponses
non-verbal gestures that could imply the visually impaired individual not appearing interested
speaking when not anticipated or not speaking when anticipated
fear of offending the visually impaired
standing too close and invading the personal comfort level
having to exercise or ignore feelings of pity
being uncomfortable with touching objects or people
a look of detachment or disengagement
dependency
being reminded of the fear of becoming blind
the blind person sends these signals or types of non-verbal communication without being aware that they are doing so these factors can all affect the way an individual would feel about communicating with the visually impaired this leaves the visually impaired feeling rejected and lonely


 adjusting attitude 
in the article towards better communication from the interest point of view or—skills of sight-glish for the blind and visually impaired the author rivka bialistock  comes up with a method to reduce individuals being uncomfortable with communicating with the visually impaired this method is called blind-glish or sight-glish which is a language for the blind similar to english for example babies who are not born and able to talk right away communicate through sight-glish simply seeing everything and communicating non-verbally this comes naturally to sighted babies and by teaching this same method to babies with a visual impairment can improve their ability to communicate better from the very beginning
to avoid the rejected feeling of the visually impaired people need to treat the blind the same way they would treat anyone else rather than treating them like they have a disability and need special attention people may feel that it is improper to for example tell their blind child to look at them when they are speaking however this contributes to the sight-glish method it is important to disregard any mental fears or uncomfortable feelings people have while communicating verbally and non-verbally face-to-face


 surroundings 
individuals with a visual disability not only have to find ways to communicate effectively with the people around them but their environment as well the blind or visually impaired rely largely on their other senses such as hearing touch and smell in order to understand their surroundings


 sound 
sound is one of the most important senses that the blind or visually impaired use in order to locate objects in their surroundings a form of echolocation is used similarly to that of a bat echolocation from a persons perspective is when the person uses sound waves generated from speech or other forms of noise such as cane tapping which reflect off of objects and bounce back at the person giving them a rough idea of where the object is this does not mean they can depict details based on sound but rather where objects are in order to interact or avoid them increases in atmospheric pressure and humidity increase a persons ability to use sound to their advantage as wind or any form of background noise impairs it


 touch 
touch is also an important aspect of how blind or visually impaired people perceive the world touch gives immense amount of information in the persons immediate surrounding feeling anything with detail gives off information on shape size texture temperature and many other qualities touch also helps with communication braille is a form of communication in which people use their fingers to feel elevated bumps on a surface and can understand what is meant to be interpreted there are some issues and limitations with touch as not all objects are accessible to feel which makes it difficult to perceive the actual object another limiting factor is that the learning process of identifying objects with touch is much slower than identifying objects with sight this is due to the fact the object needs to be approached and carefully felt until a rough idea can be constructed in the brain


 smell 
certain smells can be associated with specific areas and help a person with vision problems to remember a familiar area this way there is a better chance of recognizing an areas layout in order to navigate themselves through the same can be said for people as well some people have their own special odor that a person with a more trained sense of smell can pick up a person with an impairment of their vision can use this to recognize people within their vicinity without them saying a word


 communication development 
visual impairment can have profound effects on the development of infant and child communication the language and social development of a child or infant can be very delayed by the inability to see the world around them


 social development 
social development includes interactions with the people surrounding the infant in the beginning of its life to a child with vision a smile from a parent is the first symbol of recognition and communication and is almost an instant factor of communication for a visually impaired infant recognition of a parents voice will be noticed at approximately two months old but a smile will only be evoked through touch between parent and baby this primary form of communication is greatly delayed for the child and will prevent other forms of communication from developing social interactions are more complicated because subtle visual cues are missing and facial expressions from others are lost
due to delays in a childs communication development they may appear to be disinterested in social activity with peers non-communicative and un-education on how to communicate with other people this may cause the child to be avoided by peers and consequently over protected by family members


 language development 
with sight much of what is learned by a child is learned through imitation of others where as a visually impaired child needs very planned instruction directed at the development of postponed imitation a visually impaired infant may jabber and imitate words sooner than a sighted child but may show delay when combining words to say themselves the child may tend to initiate few questions and their use of adjectives is infrequent normally the childs sensory experiences are not readily coded into language and this may cause them to store phrases and sentences in their memory and repeat them out of context the language of the blind child does not seem to mirror their developing knowledge of the world but rather their knowledge of the language of others
a visually impaired child may also be hesitant to explore the world around them due to fear of the unknown and also may be discouraged from exploration by overprotective family members without concrete experiences the child is not able to develop meaningful concepts or the language to describe or think about them


 healthcare access 
visual impairment has the ability to create consequences for health and well being visual impairment is increasing especially among older people it is recognized that those individuals with visual impairment are likely to have limited access to information and healthcare facilities and may not receive the best care possible because not all health care professionals are aware of specific needs related to vision
a prerequisite of effective health care could very well be having staff that are aware that people may have problems with vision
communication and different ways of being able to communicate with visually impaired clients must be tailored to individual needs and available at all times


 epidemiology 
the who estimates that in 2012 there were 285 million visually impaired people in the world of which 246 million had low vision and 39 million were blind
of those who are blind 90% live in the developing world worldwide for each blind person an average of 3.4 people have low vision with country and regional variation ranging from 2.4 to 5.5
by age visual impairment is unequally distributed across age groups more than 82% of all people who are blind are 50 years of age and older although they represent only 19% of the worlds population due to the expected number of years lived in blindness blind years childhood blindness remains a significant problem with an estimated 1.4 million blind children below age 15
by gender available studies consistently indicate that in every region of the world and at all ages females have a significantly higher risk of being visually impaired than males
by geography visual impairment is not distributed uniformly throughout the world more than 90% of the worlds visually impaired live in developing countries
since the estimates of the 1990s new data based on the 2002 global population show a reduction in the number of people who are blind or visually impaired and those who are blind from the effects of infectious diseases but an increase in the number of people who are blind from conditions related to longer life spans
in 1987 it was estimated that 598,000 people in the united states met the legal definition of blindness of this number 58% were over the age of 65 in 1994–1995 1.3 million americans reported legal blindness

the study used a common cold virus to deliver a normal version of the gene called rpe65 directly into the eyes of affected patients remarkably all 3 patients aged 19 22 and 25 responded well to the treatment and reported improved vision following the procedure due to the age of the patients and the degenerative nature of lca the improvement of vision in gene therapy patients is encouraging for researchers it is hoped that gene therapy may be even more effective in younger lca patients who have experienced limited vision loss as well as in other blind or partially blind individuals
