sir arthur john evans frs freng  8 july 1851 – 11 july 1941 was an english archaeologist and pioneer in the study of aegean civilization in the bronze age he is most famous for unearthing the palace of knossos on the greek island of crete evans continued heinrich schliemanns concept of a mycenaean civilization but found that he needed to distinguish another civilization the minoan from the structures and artifacts found there and throughout the eastern mediterranean evans was also the first to define cretan scripts linear a and linear b as well as an earlier pictographic writing
although not a professional statesman or soldier and probably never a paid agent of the government he nevertheless negotiated or played a role in negotiating unofficially with foreign powers in the balkans and middle east he was on request of the revolutionary organizations of the peoples of the balkans a significant player in the formation of the nation of yugoslavia


 biographical background 


 family 

arthur evans was born in nash mills england the first child of john evans 1823-1908 and harriet ann dickinson born 1824 his first cousin the daughter of johns employer the inventor and founder of messrs john dickinson a paper mill john evans came from a family of men who were both educated and intellectually active they were nevertheless undistinguished by either wealth or aristocratic connection johns father arthur benoni evans arthurs grandfather had been headmaster of market bosworth grammar school john knew latin and could quote the classical authors
in 1840 instead of going to college john started work in the mill owned by his maternal uncle john dickinson he married his cousin harriet in 1850 which entitled him in 1851 to a junior partnership in the family business profits from the mill would eventually help fund arthurs excavations restorations at knossos and resulting publications for the time being they were an unpretentious and affectionate family they moved into a brick row house built for the purpose near the mill which came to be called the red house because it lacked the sooty patina of the other houses harriet called her husband jack grandmother evans called arthur darling trot asserting in a note that compared to his father he was a bit of a dunce in 1856 with harriets declining health and jacks growing reputation and prosperity they moved into harriets childhood home a mansion with a garden where the children ran free
john maintained his status as an officer in the company which eventually became john dickinson stationery but also became distinguished for his pursuits in numismatics geology and archaeology his interest in geology came from an assignment by the company to study the diminishing water resources in the area with a view toward protecting the company from lawsuits the mill consumed large amounts of water which was also needed for the canals he became an expert and a legal consultant however collecting was endemic to the family his father and grandfather both had done it he was more interested in the stone-age artifacts he was discovering while mapping stream beds as arthur grew older he was allowed to assist john in looking for artifacts and later classifying the collection
ultimately john became a distinguished antiquary publishing numerous books and articles in 1859 he conducted a geological survey of the somme valley with joseph prestwich his connections and invaluable advice were indispensable to arthurs career throughout the remainder of his long life
arthurs mother harriet died in 1858 when arthur was seven he had two brothers philip norman 1854 and lewis 1853 and two sisters alice 1858 and harriet 1857 he would remain on excellent terms with all of them all of his life he was raised by a stepmother fanny frances née phelps with whom he also got along very well she had no children of her own and also predeceased her husband johns third wife was a classical scholar maria millington lathbury when he was 70 they had a daughter joan who would become an art historian john died in 1908 at 85 when arthur was 57 his close support and assistance had been indispensable in excavating and conceptualizing minoan civilization


 education 


 old harrovian 

arthur was given every advantage of education after a childhood stay at callipers preparatory school no longer extant he entered harrow school in 1865 at age 14 at which he did well he was co-editor of the harrovian in his final year 1869/70 at harrow he was friends especially with francis maitland balfour both boys had similar interests they competed for the natural history prize the outcome was a draw they were both highly athletic riding swimming and mountain-climbing at which balfour was killed later in life arthur suffered from near-sightedness but refused to wear glasses his close-up vision was better than normal enabling him to see detail missed by others farther away his field of vision was blurry he compensated by carrying a cane which he called prodger to explore the environment his wit was very sharp too sharp for the administration which stopped a periodical he had started the pen-viper after the first issue
after graduation evans became part of and relied on the old harrovian network of acquaintances minchin characterized him as a philologer and wit as well as an expert on the eastern question ie diplomatic and political problems posed by the decay of the ottoman empire


 oxford man 

arthur matriculated on 9 jun 1870 and attended brasenose college oxford his housemaster at harrow f rendall had eased the way to his acceptance with the recommendation that he was a boy of powerful original mind at brasenose he chose to read modern history a new curriculum which was nearly a disaster as his main interests were in archaeology and classical studies
his summertime activities with his brothers and friends were perhaps more important to his subsequent career having been given an ample allowance by his father he went looking for adventure on the continent deliberately seeking out circumstances that might be considered dangerous by some in june 1871 he and lewis visited hallstatt where his father had excavated in 1866 adding some of the artifacts to his collection arthur had made himself familiar with these
subsequently they went on to paris and then to amiens the franco-prussian war had just concluded the month before arthur had been told at the french border to remove the dark cape he was wearing so that he would not be shot for a spy amiens was occupied by the prussian army arthur found them prosaic and preoccupied with souvenir-hunting he and lewis hunted for stone-age artifacts in the gravel quarries arthur remarking that he was glad the prussians were not interested in flint artifacts
in 1872 he and norman adventured into ottoman territory in the carpathians already in a state of political tension they crossed borders illegally at high altitudes revolvers at the ready this was arthurs first encounter with turkish people and customs he bought a complete set of clothes of a wealthy turkish man complete with red fez baggy trousers and embroidered short-sleeved tunic his detailed enthusiastic account was published in frasers magazine for may 1873
in 1873 he and balfour tramped over lapland finland and sweden everywhere he went he took copious anthropological notes and made numerous drawings of the people places and artifacts during the christmas holidays of 1873 evans cataloged a coin collection being bequeathed to harrow by john gardner wilkinson the father of british egyptology who was too ill to work on it himself the headmaster had suggested my old pupil arthur john evans – a remarkably able young man


 little evans son of john evans the great 
arthur graduated from oxford at the age of 24 in 1874 but his career had come near to floundering during the final examinations on a special topic modern history despite his extensive knowledge of ancient history classics archaeology and what would be termed today cultural anthropology he apparently had not even read enough in his nominal major to pass the required examination he could answer no questions on topics later than the 12th century
fortuitously he had convinced one of his examiners edward augustus freeman of his talent they were both published authors they were both gladstone liberals and they were both interested in and on the side of bosnian and herzegovinian insurrection moreover freeman was raising four attractive and talented daughters freeman convinced evanss tutors george kitchen and john richard green and they convinced the regius professor william stubbs that in view of his special other knowledge and interests and his fathers high standing in learned society evans should not only be passed but receive a first it was the topic of much jesting green wrote to freeman on 11 november 1875

i am very sorry to have missed you dear freeman  little evans — son of john evans the great — has just come back from the herzegovina which he reached by way of lapland having started from the schools in excitement at the first i wrung for him out of the obdurate stubbs 


 fiasco at göttingen 
in the spring of 1875 he applied for the archaeological travelling studentship offered by oxford but as he says in a letter to freeman later in life he was turned down thanks to the efforts of benjamin jowett and charles thomas newton two oxford dons having a low opinion of his work there he was bitterly disappointed in april–july of that year he attended a summer term at the university of göttingen at the suggestion of henry montagu butler then headmaster at harrow evans was to study with reinhold pauli who had spent some years in britain and was a friend of green the study would be preparatory to doing research in modern history at göttingen the arrangement may have been meant as a remedial plan on the way to göttingen evans was sidetracked unpropitiously for the modern history plan by some illegal excavations at trier he had noticed that the tombs were being plundered surreptitiously for the sake of preserving some artifacts he hired a crew performed such hasty excavations as he could crated the material and sent it home to john
göttingen was not to evanss liking his quarters were stuffy and the topics were of little interest to him as he had already demonstrated his letters speak mainly of the discrepancy between the poor peasants of the countryside and the institution of the wealthy in the town his thinking was of a revolutionary bent deciding not to stay he left there abruptly to meet lewis for another trip to the balkans that decision marked the end of his formal education bosnia and herzegovina were then in a full-blown state of insurrection the ottomans were using bashi-bazouks to try to quell it despite subsequent events there is no evidence that the young evans might have had ulterior motives at this time despite the fact that butler had helped to educate half the government of the united kingdom he was simply an adventurous young man bored with poring through books in a career into which he had been pushed against his real interests the real adventure in his mind was the revolution in the balkans


 career 


 agent in the balkans 


 private adventurer 

after resolving to leave göttingen evans and lewis planned an adventure in bosnia and herzegovina starting immediately in august 1875 they knew that the region a part of the ottoman empire was under martial law and that the christians were in a state of insurrection against the bosnian muslim beys placed over them some ottoman troops were in the country in support of the beys but mainly the beys were using mercenaries the bashi-bazouks private armies recruited from anywhere loosely attached to the ottoman military large numbers could be assembled on short notice their notorious cruelty which they practised against the natives helped to turn the british empire under gladstone against the ottoman empire as well as to attract russian intervention at serbian request the very sequence of events that when the region was under the austro-hungarian empire would result in worldwide conflagration at the time of evans and lewiss initial adventure the ottomans were still trying to lessen the threat of intervention by placating their neighbours evans sought and obtained permission to travel in bosnia even though at war from its turkish military governor
the two brothers experienced little difficulty with either the serbs or the ottomans but they did provoke the neighboring austro-hungarian empire and spent the night in a wretched cell after deciding to lodge in a good hotel in slavonski brod on the border having judged it safer than bosanski brod across the sava river they were observed by an officer who saw their sketches and concluded they might be russian spies politely invited by two other officers to join the police chief and produce passports evans replied tell him that we are englishmen and are not accustomed to being treated in this way the officers insisted and interrupting the chief at dinner evans suggested he should have come to the hotel in person to request the passports the chief in a somewhat less than civil manner won the argument about whether he had the right to check the passports of englishmen by inviting them to spend the night in a cell
on the way to the holding cell the two young men were followed by a large crowd whom evans lost no opportunity to harangue even though they understood only german he threatened the authorities in the name of the british fleet which he asserted would sail up the sava river he demanded the mayor offered the jailer a bribe for food and water but went into the cell unfed and without water meanwhile the incident came to attention of dr makanetz leader of the national party of the croatian assembly who happened to be in brod the next day he complained to the mayor evans and his brother were released with profuse apologies forthwith
they crossed the sava into bosnia which evans found so different that he regarded the sava as the border between europe and asia after a number of interviews with turkish officials who attempted to dissuade them from travel on foot the passport from the pasha prevailed they were given an escort – one man enough to establish authority – as far as dervent from there they travelled directly south to sarajevo and from there to dubrovnik ragusa on the coast in dalmatia in sarajevo they learned that the region through which they had just passed was now plunged in civil war they were escorted to the british consulate the consul was away at mostar but the young men were greeted by a familiar figure edward augustus freeman chargé daffaires and his amiable daughters edward was assisting his good friend the prime minister to keep an eye on the situation they relaxed in the quiet of an english garden
the english protestants of sarajevo some of whom had come in a missionary capacity were packing to leave the country as were other resident europeans shortly the revolt reached lower bosnia turkish garrisons were massacred in response to which the irregular turkish troops began to massacre the christian population streamed across the sava into austria the pasha of sarajevo however was determined to keep the peace the young men spent their last day there shopping quietly then they headed south to ragusa where evans later was to spend so many happily married years in his own villa on the sea


 reporter for the manchester guardian 
home again evans wrote of his experiences working from his extensive notes and drawings publishing through bosnia and herzegovina which was so popular it came out in two editions 1876 and 1877 he became overnight an expert in balkan affairs the manchester guardian hired him as a correspondent sending him back to the balkans in 1877 he reported on the suppression of the christian insurrectionists by the armed forces of the ottoman empire and yet was treated by that empire as though he were an ambassador despite his anti-turkish sentiments his older interests in antiquities continued he collected portable artifacts especially sealstones at every opportunity between sending back article after article to the guardian he also visited the freemans in sarajevo whenever he could a relationship with one of the winsome daughters margaret had begun to blossom in 1878 the russians compelled a settlement of the conflict on appeal by the serbs the ottomans ceded bosnia and herzegovina to the austro-hungarian empire as a protectorate
in 1878 evans proposed to margaret freemans oldest daughter three years his senior an educated and literate woman and until now secretary for her father the offer was accepted to everyones great satisfaction freeman spoke affectionately of his future son-in-law the couple were married near the freeman home in wookey at the parish church after a celebration they took up residence in a venetian villa evans had purchased in ragusa casa san lazzaro on the bluffs overlooking the adriatic one of their first tasks was to create a garden there they lived happily evans pursuing his journalistic career until 1882
ultimately evanss continued stance in favour of native government led to a condition of unacceptability to the local regime within the austro-hungarian empire he did not see the austro-hungarian regime as an improvement over the ottoman he wrote the people are treated not as a liberated but as a conquered and inferior race the evanss sentiments were followed by acts of personal charity they took in an orphan invited a blind woman to dinner every night finally evans wrote some public letters in favour of an insurrection
evans was arrested in 1882 to be put on trial as a british agent provocateur stirring up further insurrection his journalistic sources were not acceptable friendships to the authorities he spent six weeks in prison awaiting trial but at the trial nothing definitive could be proved his wife was interrogated she found most offensive the reading of her love letters before her eyes by a hostile police agent evans was expelled from the country gladstone had been apprised of the situation immediately but as far as the public knew did nothing the government in vienna similarly disavowed any knowledge of or connection to the actions of the local authorities the evanss returned home to rent a house in oxford abandoning their villa which was turned into a hotel however evanss reputation among the slavs assumed unassailable proportions he was invited later to play a role in the formation of the pre-yugoslav state in 1941 the government of yugoslavia sent representatives to his funeral


 keeper of the ashmolean museum 

evans and margaret moved back to oxford renting a house there in january 1883 this period of unemployment was the only one of his life he employed himself finishing up his balkan studies he completed his articles on roman roads and cities there it was suggested that he apply to a new professorship of classical archaeology at oxford when he found out that jowett and newton were among the electors he decided not to apply he wrote to freeman that to confine archaeology to classics was an absurdity instead he and margaret travelled to greece seeking out heinrich schliemann at athens margaret and sophia had a long visit for several hours during which evans examined the mycenaean antiquities at hand with heinrich
meanwhile ashmolean museum an adjunct of oxford university was in a chaotic state of transition it had been a natural history museum but the collections had been transferred to other museums the lower floor housed some art and archaeology but the upper floor was being used for university functions john henry parker appointed the first keeper in 1870 had the task of trying to manage it his efforts to negotiate with the art collector c drury e fortnum over housing his extensive collection were being undercut university administrators in january 1874 parker died the museum was in the hands of its assistant keepers one of whom edward evans no relation was to be evanss executive during evanss extended absences
the strategy for the museum now was to convert it to an art and archaeology museum expanding the remaining collections  in november 1883 fortnum wrote to evans asking for his assistance in locating some letters in the bodleian library that would help to validate a noted ring in his collection he did so on the advice of john evans of the society of antiquaries unable to find the letters arthur evans suggested fortnum visit oxford fortnum in fact was becoming dissatisfied with rivals for his collection the south kensington museum because of their lack of a properly informed and competent person as keeper evans had the right qualifications and took the position of keeper at the ashmolean when it was offered
in 1884 therefore evans at the age of 34 was appointed keeper of the ashmolean museum he held a grand inauguration at which he outlined his planned changes publishing it as the ashmolean as a home of archaeology in oxford already the great frontage building had been erected evans took it firmly in the direction of being an archaeology museum he insisted the artifacts be transferred back to the museum negotiated for and succeeded in acquiring fortnums collections later gave his father’s collections to the museum and finally bequeathed his own minoan collections not without the intended effect today it has the finest minoan assemblages outside crete he also persuaded fortnum to donate £10,000 to build the extensive rooms behind the impressive façade buildings which have only recently been demolished to make way for the new ashmolean museum
evans gave the ilchester lectures for 1884 on the slavonic conquest of illyricum which remained unpublished


 archaeologist 


 excavations at aylesford 
a cemetery of the british iron age discovered in 1886 at aylesford in kent was excavated under the leadership of evans and published in 1890 with the later excavation by others at swarling not far away discovery to publication was 1921–1925 this is the type site for aylesford-swarling pottery or the aylesford-swarling culture which included the first wheel-made pottery in britain evanss conclusion that the site belonged to a culture closely related to the continental belgae remains the modern view though the dating has been refined to the period after about 75 bc his analysis of the site was still regarded as an outstanding contribution to iron age studies with a masterly consideration of the metalwork by sir barry cunliffe in 2012


 end and beginning 
in 1893 evanss way of life as a married middling archaeologist puttering around the ashmolean and travelling extensively and perpetually on holiday with his beloved margaret came to an abrupt end leaving emotional devastation in its wake and changing the course of his life freeman died in march 1892 always of precarious health he had heard that spain had a salubrious climate traveling there to test the hypothesis and perhaps improve his physical condition he contracted smallpox and was gone in a few days his oldest daughter did not survive him long always of precarious health herself – she is said to have had tuberculosis – she was too weak to prepare her fathers papers for publication so she delegated the task to a family friend reverend william stephens
in october of that year evans took her to visit boars hill near oxford in legend so named because a scholar attacked by a boar there choked it to death by stuffing a copy of aristotle in its mouth he wanted to buy 60 acres to build a home for margaret on the hill she approved the location so he convinced his father to put up the money then he had the tops of the pines cut eight feet from the ground on which he had built a platform and a log cabin to serve as a temporary quarters while the mansion was being built his intent was to keep her from the cold damp ground apparently she never lived there they were away again for the winter margaret to winter with her sister in bordighera evans to sicily to complete the last volume of the history he and freeman had begun together
in february evans met john myres a student at the british school in athens the two shopped the flea markets looking for antiquities evans purchased some seal stones inscribed with a mysterious writing said to have come from crete then he met margaret in bordighera the two started back to athens but en route in alassio italy she was overtaken by a severe attack on 11 march 1893 after experiencing painful spasms for two hours she died with evans holding her hand of an unknown disease perhaps tuberculosis although the symptoms fit a heart attack also he was 42 she 45
margaret was buried in the english cemetery at alassio her epitaph says in part her bright energetic spirit undaunted by suffering to the last and ever working for the welfare of those around her made a short life long evans placed on the grave a wreath he wove himself of margarite and wild broom expressive of their innermost feelings commemorating the event with a private poem to margaret my beloved wife not published until after his death decades later

of margarites and mountain heath
and scented broom so white –
such as herself she plucked – a wreath
i wreathe for her tonight

for she was open as the air
pure as the blue of heaven
and truer love – or pearl so rare
to man was never given

to his father who had a more practical view having had motherless children to care for he wrote i do not think anyone can ever know what margaret has been to me he never married again for the rest of his life he wrote on black-bordered stationery he went ahead with the mansion he had planned to build for margaret on boars hill against the advice of his father who regarded it as wasteful and useless he called it youlbury after the name of the locality


 waiting for the future 

after margarets death evans wandered aimlessly around liguria ostensibly looking at terramare culture sites and for neolithic remains in ligurian caves then he revisited the locations of his youthful explorations in zagreb finally he returned to live a hermit-like existence in the cabin he had built for her the ashmolean no longer interested him he complained petulantly to fortnam in a late childish display of sibling rivalry that his father had had another child his half-sister joan after a year of grief the mounting tension in crete began to attract his interest knossos was now known to be a major site thanks to evanss old friend and fellow journalist in bosnia william james stillman another old friend federico halbherr the italian archaeologist and future excavator of phaistos was keeping him posted on developments at knossos by mail
archaeologists from the united states britain france germany and italy were in attendance at the site watching the progress so to speak of the sick man of europe a metaphor of the dying ottoman empire the various pashas eager not to offend the native cretan parliament were encouraging foreigners to apply for a firman to excavate and then not granting any the cretans were afraid of the ottomans removing any artifacts to istanbul the ottoman method of stalling was to require any would-be excavators to buy the site from its native owners first the owners in turn were coached to charge so much money that none would think it worthwhile to apply in such uncertain circumstances even the wealthy schliemann had given up on the price in 1890 and had gone home to die in that year
in 1894 evans became intrigued by the idea that the script engraved on the stones he had purchased before margarets death might be cretan and steamed off to heraklion to join the circle of watchers during his year of tending to the details of youlbury administering the ashmolean and writing some minor papers he had also discovered the script on some other jewellery that came to the museum from myres in crete he announced that he had concluded to a mycenaean hieroglyphic script of about 60 characters shortly he wrote to his friend and patron at the ashmolean charles fortnum that he was very restless and must go to crete
arriving in heraklion he did not join his friends immediately but took the opportunity to examine the excavations at knossos seeing the sign of the double axe almost immediately he knew that he was at the home of the script he used the cretan exploration fund devised on the model of the palestine exploration fund to acquire the site the owners would not sell to individuals who could not afford it but they would sell to a fund apparently evans did not bother to explain that he was the only contributor he bought 1/4 of the site with first option to buy the rest later the firman was still in deficit politics in crete were taking a violent turn however anything might happen evans returned to london to wind up his affairs there and make sure the ashmolean had suitable direction in the event of his further absence


 the pen-viper uncaged 
in september 1898 the last of the turkish troops withdrew from crete the war was over but not the fighting as the christians took reprisals on the muslims and the muslims sought to defend themselves the british army forbade travel for any reason checkpoints went up everywhere evans myres and hogarth returned to crete together evans this time as correspondent for the manchester guardian a role in which he reveled his sharp tongue had not mellowed over the years he was once again the pen-viper but this time there was no administration to cage him he criticized the ottoman empire for its corruption as usual then he criticized the british empire for its collaboration with the ottoman many officials of that empire had been greek now they were working with the british trying to build a credible cretan government for them evans invented a new and eloquent term the turco-british regime he criticised the muslims for attacking the christians and the christians for attacking the muslims he collided with the british military complaining vociferously to the british higher authorities
evans went everywhere investigating everything recklessly he always made moral judgments taking the side of the underdog no matter who it was he saw that the muslim population was now on the decline some being massacred and some abandoning the island after the massacre at the village of eteà he came down mainly on the moslem side the villagers had been attacked by christians in the night they sought refuge in a mosque the next day they were promised clemency if they would disarm themselves handing over their weapons they were lined up to be marched elsewhere they were told instead they were shot the only survivor being a small girl who had a cape thrown over her to conceal her
prince george was completely conciliatory assisting in any way that he could to halt the bloodshed and establish a new constitution in 1899 a government of both christians and muslims was elected under it crete was a republic although a protected one evanss political work was done


 discovery of minoan civilization 
now that the restriction of the ottoman firman was removed there was a great rush on the part of all the other archaeologists to obtain first permission to dig from the new cretan government they soon found that evans had a monopoly using the cretan exploration fund now being swollen by contributions from others he paid off the debt for the land then he ordered stores from britain he hired two foremen and they hired 32 diggers he started work on the flower-covered hill in march 1900
assisted by duncan mackenzie who had already distinguished himself by his excavations on the island of melos and mr fyfe an architect from the british school at athens evans employed a large staff of local labourers as excavators and began work in 1900 within a few months they had uncovered a substantial portion of what he called the palace of minos the term palace may be misleading knossos was an intricate collection of over 1000 interlocking rooms some of which served as artisans workrooms and food processing centres eg wine presses it served as a central storage point and a religious and administrative centre
on the basis of the ceramic evidence and stratigraphy evans concluded that there was another civilization on crete that had existed before those brought to light by the adventurer-archaeologist heinrich schliemann at mycenae and tiryns the small ruin of knossos spanned 5 acres 20,000 m2 and the palace had a maze-like quality that reminded evans of the labyrinth described in greek mythology in the myth the labyrinth had been built by king minos to hide the minotaur a half-man half-bull creature that was the offspring of minoss wife pasiphae and a bull evans dubbed the civilization once inhabiting this great palace the minoan civilization
by 1903 most of the palace was excavated bringing to light an advanced city containing artwork and many examples of writing painted on the walls of the palace were numerous scenes depicting bulls leading evans to conclude that the minoans did indeed worship the bull in 1905 he finished excavations he then proceeded to have the room called the throne room due to the throne-like stone chair fixed in the room repainted by a father-and-son team of swiss artists the émile gilliéron junior and senior while evans based the recreations on archaeological evidence some of the best-known frescoes from the throne room were almost complete inventions of the gilliérons according to his critics


 senior trustee 
all the excavations at knossos were done on leave of absence from the museum while the keeper’s salary was not generous the conditions of residence were very liberal  the keeper could and should travel to secure new acquisitions but in 1908 at the age of 57 he resigned his position to concentrate on writing up his minoan work in 1912 he refused the opportunity to become president of the society of antiquaries a position which his father had already held but in 1914 at the age of 63 when he was too old to take part in the war he took on the presidency of the antiquaries which carried with it an ex officio appointment as a trustee of the british museum and he spent the war successfully fighting the war office who wanted to commandeer the museum for the air board he thus played a major role in the history of the british museum as well as in the history of the ashmolean museum


 major creative works 


 scripta minoa 

during excavations by evans he found 3000 clay tablets which he transcribed and organized publishing them in scripta minoa as some of them are now missing the transcriptions are the only source of the marks on the tablets he perceived that the scripts were two different and mutually exclusive writing systems which later he termed into linear a and linear b the a script appeared to have preceded the b evans dated the linear b chariot tablets so called from their depictions of chariots at knossos to immediately prior to the catastrophic minoan civilization collapse of the 15th century bc
one of evanss theses in the 1901 scripta minoa is that most of the symbols for the phoenician alphabet abjad are almost identical to the many centuries older 19th century bc cretan hieroglyphs
the basic part of the discussion about phoenician alphabet in scripta minoa vol 1 takes place in the section cretan philistines and the phoenician alphabet modern scholars now see it as a continuation of the proto-canaanite alphabet from ca 1400 bc adapted to writing a canaanite northwest semitic language the phoenician alphabet seamlessly continues the proto-canaanite alphabet by convention called phoenician from the mid-11th century where it is first attested on inscribed bronze arrowheads
evans had no better luck with linear b which turned out to be greek despite decades of theories linear a has not been convincingly deciphered nor even the language group identified his classifications and careful transcriptions have been of great value to mycenaean scholars


 honours 

he was a member and officer of many learned societies including being elected a fellow of the royal society frs in 1901 he won the lyell medal in 1880 and the copley medal in 1936 in 1911 evans was knighted by king george v for his services to archaeology and is commemorated both at knossos and at the ashmolean museum which holds the largest collection of minoan artifacts outside of greece he received an honorary doctorate dlitt from the university of dublin in june 1901


 other legacies 
in 1913 he paid £100 to double the amount paid with the studentship in memory of augustus wollaston franks established jointly by the university of london and the society of antiquaries which was won that year by mortimer wheeler
from 1894 until his death in 1941 evans lived in his house youlbury which has since been demolished he had jarn mound and its surrounding wild garden built during the great depression to make work for local out-of-work labourers evans left part of his estate to the boy scouts and youlbury camp is still available for their use
