a blue moon is an additional full moon that appears in a subdivision of a year either the third of four full moons in a season or a second full moon in a month of the common calendar
the phrase has nothing to do with the actual color of the moon although a literal blue moon the moon appearing with a tinge of blue may occur in certain atmospheric conditions eg if volcanic eruptions or fires leave particles in the atmosphere of just the right size to preferentially scatter red light


 definition 

the term has traditionally referred to an extra full moon where a year which normally has 12 full moons has 13 instead the blue moon reference is applied to the third full moon in a season with four full moons thus correcting the timing of the last month of a season that would have otherwise been expected too early this happens every two to three years seven times in the metonic cycle of 19 years the march 1946 issue of sky  telescope misinterpreted the traditional definition which led to the modern colloquial misunderstanding that a blue moon is a second full moon in a single solar calendar month with no seasonal link
owing to the rarity of a blue moon the term blue moon is used colloquially to mean a rare event as in the phrase once in a blue moon
one lunation an average lunar cycle is 29.53 days there are about 365.24 days in a tropical year therefore about 12.37 lunations 365.24 days divided by 29.53 days occur in a tropical year in the widely used gregorian calendar there are 12 months the word month is derived from moon in a year and normally there is one full moon each month each calendar year contains roughly 11 days more than the number of days in 12 lunar cycles the extra days accumulate so every two or three years seven times in the 19-year metonic cycle there is an extra full moon the extra full moon necessarily falls in one of the four seasons giving that season four full moons instead of the usual three and hence a blue moon
in calculating the dates for lent and easter catholic clergy identified a lenten moon historically when the moons arrived too early they called the early moon a betrayer belewe moon so the lenten moon came at its expected time
folklore named each of the 12 full moons in a year according to its time of year the occasional 13th full moon that came too early for its season was called a blue moon so the rest of the moons that year retained their customary seasonal names
the maine farmers almanac called the third full moon in a season that had four the blue moon
the frequency of a blue moon can be calculated as follows it is the period of time it would take for an extra synodic orbit of the moon to occur in a year given that a year is approximately 365.2425 days and a synodic orbit is 29.5309 days then there are about 12.368 synodic months in a year for this to add up to another full month would take 1/0.368 years thus it would take about 2.716 years or 2 years 8 months and 18 days for another blue moon to occur
using the common sky  telescope misunderstanding when one calendar month has two full moons the second one is called a blue moon on rare occasions in a calendar year as happened in 2010 in time zones east of utc07 both january and march each have two full moons so that the second one in each month is called a blue moon in this case the month of february with only 28 or 29 days has no full moon under this misinterpretation a blue moon can be more frequent


 origin of the term 

the suggestion has been made that the term blue moon for intercalary month arose by folk etymology the blue replacing the no-longer-understood belewe to betray the original meaning would then have been betrayer moon referring to a full moon that would normally in years without an intercalary month be the full moon of spring while in an intercalary year it was traitorous in the sense that people would have had to continue fasting for another month in accordance with the season of lent
the earliest recorded english usage of the term blue moon is found in an anti-clerical pamphlet attacking the roman clergy and cardinal thomas wolsey in particular by two converted greenwich friars william roy and jerome barlow published in 1528 under the title rede me and be nott wrothe for i say no thynge but trothe the relevant passage reads

o churche men are wyly foxes  yf they say the mone is blewe  we must beleve that it is true  admittynge their interpretacion

it is not clear from the context that this refers to intercalation the context of the passage is a dialogue between two priests servants spoken by the character jeffrey a brefe dialoge betwene two prestes servauntis named watkyn and ieffraye the intention may simply be that jeffrey makes an absurd statement the moon is blue to make the point that priests require laymen to believe in statements even if they are patently false but in the above interpretation of betrayer moon jeffrey may also be saying that it is up to the priests to say when lent will be delayed by announcing blue moons which laymen have no means to verify


 maine farmers almanac blue moons 
in the 19th and early 20th centuries the maine farmers almanac listed blue moon dates for farmers these correspond to the third full moon in a quarter of the year when there were four full moons normally a quarter year has three full moons full moon names were given to each lunation in a season the seasons used were those of the mean tropical year equal in length as opposed to the astronomical seasons which vary in length because the earths speed in its orbit round the sun is not uniform
to compare in 1983 the equal seasons began at 1.48 am on 23 march 9.15 am on 22 june 4.42 pm on 21 september and 12.10 am on 22 december while the astronomical seasons began at 4.39 am on 21 march 11.09 pm on 21 june 2.42 pm on 23 september and 10.30 am on 22 december all times gmt when a season has four full moons the third is called the blue moon so that the last can continue to be called with the proper name for that season


 sky and telescope calendar misinterpretation 
the march 1946 sky and telescope article once in a blue moon by james hugh pruett misinterpreted the 1937 maine farmers almanac seven times in 19 years there were – and still are – 13 full moons in a year this gives 11 months with one full moon each and one with two this second in a month so i interpret it was called blue moon widespread adoption of the definition of a blue moon as the second full moon in a month followed its use on the popular radio program stardate on january 31 1980 and in a question in the trivial pursuit game in 1986


 visibly blue moon 
the most literal meaning of blue moon is when the moon not necessarily a full moon appears to a casual observer to be unusually bluish which is a rare event the effect can be caused by smoke or dust particles in the atmosphere as has happened after forest fires in sweden and canada in 1950 and 1951 and after the eruption of krakatoa in 1883 which caused the moon to appear blue for nearly two years other less potent volcanoes have also turned the moon blue people saw blue moons in 1983 after the eruption of the el chichón volcano in mexico and there are reports of blue moons caused by mount st helens in 1980 and mount pinatubo in 1991 in the antarctic diary of robert falcon scott for july 11 1911 his entry says  the air thick with snow and the moon a vague blue on that date the moon phase would have looked full
on september 23 1950 several muskeg fires that had been smoldering for several years in alberta canada suddenly blew up into major—and very smoky—fires winds carried the smoke eastward and southward with unusual speed and the conditions of the fire produced large quantities of oily droplets of just the right size about 1 micrometre in diameter to scatter red and yellow light wherever the smoke cleared enough so that the sun was visible it was lavender or blue ontario canada and much of the east coast of the united states were affected by the following day and two days later observers in britain reported an indigo sun in smoke-dimmed skies followed by an equally blue moon that evening
the key to a blue moon is having lots of particles slightly wider than the wavelength of red light 0.7 micrometer—and no other sizes present it is rare but volcanoes sometimes produce such clouds as do forest fires ash and dust clouds thrown into the atmosphere by fires and storms usually contain a mixture of particles with a wide range of sizes with most smaller than 1 micrometer and they tend to scatter blue light this kind of cloud makes the moon turn red thus red moons are far more common than blue moons
