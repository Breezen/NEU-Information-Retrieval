albert fert french fɛʁ born 7 march 1938 is a french physicist and one of the discoverers of giant magnetoresistance which brought about a breakthrough in gigabyte hard disks currently he is an emeritus professor at université paris-sud in orsay and scientific director of a joint laboratory unité mixte de recherche between the centre national de la recherche scientifique national scientific research centre and thales group he was awarded the 2007 nobel prize in physics together with peter grünberg


 biography 
fert graduated in 1962 from the école normale supérieure in paris he received his phd doctorat de troisième cycle in 1963 and his scd doctorat des sciences both from the orsay faculty of sciences of the university of paris
in 1988 albert fert at orsay in france and peter gruenberg in jülich in germany simultaneously and independently discovered the giant magnetoresistance gmr of the magnetic multilayers this discovery is recognized as the birth of spintronics a research field which is often described as a new type of electronics exploiting not only the electric charge of the electrons but also their magnetism their spin spintronics has already important applications one knows that the introduction of gmr read heads in hard disks has led to a considerable increase of their capacity of information storage other spintronic properties are exploited in the m-ram that are expected to impact soon the technology of the computers and phones albert fert had many contributions to the development of spintronics and after his 2007 nobel prize he is exploring the emerging direction of the exploitation of topological properties in spintronics his most recent works are on the topologically protected magnetic solitons called skyrmions and on the conversion between charge and spin current by topological insulators
