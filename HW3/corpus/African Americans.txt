african americans also referred to as black americans or afro-americans are an ethnic group of americans with total or partial ancestry from any of the black racial groups of africa the term typically refers to descendants of enslaved black people who are from the united states as a compound adjective the term is usually hyphenated as african-american
black and african americans constitute the third largest racial and ethnic group in the united states after white americans and hispanic and latino americans most african americans are descendants of enslaved peoples within the boundaries of the present united states on average african americans are of westcentral african and european descent and some also have native american ancestry according to us census bureau data african immigrants generally do not self-identify as african american the overwhelming majority of african immigrants identify instead with their own respective ethnicities 95 immigrants from some caribbean central american and south american nations and their descendants may or may not also self-identify with the term
african-american history starts in the 16th century with peoples from west africa forcibly taken as slaves to spanish america and in the 17th century with west african slaves taken to english colonies in north america after the founding of the united states black people continued to be enslaved and the last four million black slaves were only liberated after the civil war in 1865 due to notions of white supremacy they were treated as second-class citizens the naturalization act of 1790 limited us citizenship to whites only and only white men of property could vote these circumstances were changed by reconstruction development of the black community participation in the great military conflicts of the united states the elimination of racial segregation and the civil rights movement which sought political and social freedom in 2008 barack obama became the first african american to be elected president of the united states


 history 


 colonial era 

the first african slaves arrived via santo domingo to the san miguel de gualdape colony most likely located in the winyah bay area of present-day south carolina founded by spanish explorer lucas vázquez de ayllón in 1526
the ill-fated colony was almost immediately disrupted by a fight over leadership during which the slaves revolted and fled the colony to seek refuge among local native americans de ayllón and many of the colonists died shortly afterwards of an epidemic and the colony was abandoned the settlers and the slaves who had not escaped returned to haiti whence they had come
the first recorded africans in british north america including most of the future united states were 20 and odd negroes who came to jamestown virginia via cape comfort in august 1619 as indentured servants as english settlers died from harsh conditions more and more africans were brought to work as laborers

an indentured servant who could be white or black would work for several years usually four to seven without wages the status of indentured servants in early virginia and maryland was similar to slavery servants could be bought sold or leased and they could be physically beaten for disobedience or running away unlike slaves they were freed after their term of service expired or was bought out their children did not inherit their status and on their release from contract they received a years provision of corn double apparel tools necessary and a small cash payment called freedom dues
africans could legally raise crops and cattle to purchase their freedom they raised families married other africans and sometimes intermarried with native americans or english settlers

by the 1640s and 1650s several african families owned farms around jamestown and some became wealthy by colonial standards and purchased indentured servants of their own in 1640 the virginia general court recorded the earliest documentation of lifetime slavery when they sentenced john punch a negro to lifetime servitude under his master hugh gwyn for running away
one of the dutch african arrivals anthony johnson would later own one of the first black slaves john casor resulting from the court ruling of a civil case
the popular conception of a race-based slave system did not fully develop until the 18th century the dutch west india company introduced slavery in 1625 with the importation of eleven black slaves into new amsterdam present-day new york city all the colonys slaves however were freed upon its surrender to the british

massachusetts was the first british colony to legally recognize slavery in 1641 in 1662 virginia passed a law that children of enslaved women who were of african descent and thus foreigners took the status of the mother rather than that of the father as under english common law this principle was called partus sequitur ventrum
by an act of 1699 the colony ordered all free blacks deported virtually defining as slaves all people of african descent who remained in the colony in 1670 the colonial assembly passed a law prohibiting free and baptized negroes and indians from purchasing christians in this act meaning english or european whites but allowing them to buy people of their owne nation
the earliest african-american congregations and churches were organized before 1800 in both northern and southern cities following the great awakening by 1775 africans made up 20% of the population in the american colonies which made them the second largest ethnic group after the english


 from the american revolution to the civil war 

during the 1770s africans both enslaved and free helped rebellious english colonists secure american independence by defeating the british in the american revolution africans and englishmen fought side by side and were fully integrated blacks played a role in both sides in the american revolution activists in the patriot cause included james armistead prince whipple and oliver cromwell
slavery had been tacitly enshrined in the us constitution through provisions such as article i section 2 clause 3 commonly known as the 3/5 compromise slavery which by then meant almost exclusively african americans was the most important political issue in the antebellum united states leading to one crisis after another among these were the missouri compromise the compromise of 1850 the fugitive slave act and the dred scott decision

prior to the civil war eight serving presidents owned slaves a practice protected by the us constitution by 1860 there were 3.5 to 4.4 million enslaved blacks in the us due to the atlantic slave trade and another 488,000–500,000 african americans lived free with legislated limits across the country with legislated limits imposed upon them in addition to unconquerable prejudice from whites according to henry clay some blacks who werent enslaved left the us for liberia in africa liberia began as a settlement of the american colonization society acs in 1821 with the abolitionist members of the acs believing blacks would face better chances for freedom and equality in africa
the slaves not only constituted a large investment they produced americas most valuable product and export cotton they not only helped build the us capitol they built the white house and other district of columbia buildings washington was a slave trading center similar building projects existed in slaveholding states
in 1863 during the american civil war president abraham lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation the proclamation declared that all slaves in confederate-held territory were free advancing union troops enforced the proclamation with texas being the last state to be emancipated in 1865

slavery in union-held confederate territory continued at least on paper until the passage of the thirteenth amendment in 1865 prior to the civil war only white men of property could vote and the naturalization act of 1790 limited us citizenship to whites only the 14th amendment 1868 gave african-americans citizenship and the 15th amendment 1870 gave african-american males the right to vote only males could vote in the us at the time


 reconstruction era and jim crow 

african americans quickly set up congregations for themselves as well as schools and communitycivic associations to have space away from white control or oversight while the post-war reconstruction era was initially a time of progress for african americans that period ended in 1876 by the late 1890s southern states enacted jim crow laws to enforce racial segregation and disenfranchisement segregation which began with slavery continued with jim crow laws with signs used to show blacks where they could legally walk talk drink rest or eat for those places that were racially mixed non whites had to wait until all white customers were dealt with most african americans obeyed the jim crow laws in order to avoid racially motivated violence to maintain self-esteem and dignity african americans such as anthony overton and mary mcleod bethune continued to build their own schools churches banks social clubs and other businesses
in the last decade of the 19th century racially discriminatory laws and racial violence aimed at african americans began to mushroom in the united states a period often referred to as the nadir of american race relations these discriminatory acts included racial segregation—upheld by the united states supreme court decision in plessy v ferguson in 1896—which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the local level of government voter suppression or disenfranchisement in the southern states denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide and private acts of violence and mass racial violence aimed at african americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities


 great migration and civil rights movement 

the desperate conditions of african americans in the south sparked the great migration of the early 20th century which led to a growing african-american community in the northern united states the rapid influx of blacks disturbed the racial balance within northern cities exacerbating hostility between both black and white northerners urban riots—whites attacking blacks—became a northern problem the red summer of 1919 was marked by hundreds of deaths and higher casualties across the us as a result of race riots that occurred in more than three dozen cities such as the chicago race riot of 1919 and the omaha race riot of 1919 overall blacks in northern cities experienced systemic discrimination in a plethora of aspects of life within employment economic opportunities for blacks were routed to the lowest-status and restrictive in potential mobility within the housing market stronger discriminatory measures were used in correlation to the influx resulting in a mix of targeted violence restrictive covenants redlining and racial steering while many whites defended their space with violence intimidation or legal tactics toward african americans many other whites migrated to more racially homogeneous suburban or exurban regions a process known as white flight

by the 1950s the civil rights movement was gaining momentum a 1955 lynching that sparked public outrage about injustice was that of emmett till a 14-year-old boy from chicago spending the summer with relatives in money mississippi till was killed for allegedly having wolf-whistled at a white woman till had been badly beaten one of his eyes was gouged out and he was shot in the head the visceral response to his mothers decision to have an open-casket funeral mobilized the black community throughout the us vann r newkirk wrote the trial of his killers became a pageant illuminating the tyranny of white supremacy the state of mississippi tried two defendants but they were speedily acquitted by an all-white jury one hundred days after emmett tills murder rosa parks refused to give up her seat on the bus in alabama—indeed parks told emmetts mother mamie till that the photograph of emmett’s disfigured face in the casket was set in her mind when she refused to give up her seat on the montgomery bus

the march on washington for jobs and freedom and the conditions which brought it into being are credited with putting pressure on presidents john f kennedy and lyndon b johnson johnson put his support behind passage of the civil rights act of 1964 that banned discrimination in public accommodations employment and labor unions and the voting rights act of 1965 which expanded federal authority over states to ensure black political participation through protection of voter registration and elections by 1966 the emergence of the black power movement which lasted from 1966 to 1975 expanded upon the aims of the civil rights movement to include economic and political self-sufficiency and freedom from white authority
during the postwar period many african americans continued to be economically disadvantaged relative to other americans average black income stood at 54 percent of that of white workers in 1947 and 55 percent in 1962 in 1959 median family income for whites was 5,600 compared with 2,900 for nonwhite families in 1965 43 percent of all black families fell into the poverty bracket earning under 3,000 a year the sixties saw improvements in the social and economic conditions of many black americans
from 1965 to 1969 black family income rose from 54 to 60 percent of white family income in 1968 23 percent of black families earned under 3,000 a year compared with 41 percent in 1960 in 1965 19 percent of black americans had incomes equal to the national median a proportion that rose to 27 percent by 1967 in 1960 the median level of education for blacks had been 10.8 years and by the late sixties the figure rose to 12.2 years half a year behind the median for whites


 post–civil rights era 

politically and economically african americans have made substantial strides during the post–civil rights era in 1989 douglas wilder became the first african american elected governor in us history clarence thomas became the second african-american supreme court justice in 1992 carol moseley-braun of illinois became the first african-american woman elected to the us senate there were 8,936 black officeholders in the united states in 2000 showing a net increase of 7,467 since 1970 in 2001 there were 484 black mayors
in 2005 the number of africans immigrating to the united states in a single year surpassed the peak number who were involuntarily brought to the united states during the atlantic slave trade on november 4 2008 democratic senator barack obama defeated republican senator john mccain to become the first african american to be elected president at least 95 percent of african-american voters voted for obama he also received overwhelming support from young and educated whites a majority of asians hispanics and native americans picking up a number of new states in the democratic electoral column obama lost the overall white vote although he won a larger proportion of white votes than any previous nonincumbent democratic presidential candidate since jimmy carter obama was reelected for a second and final term by a similar margin on november 6 2012


 demographics 

in 1790 when the first us census was taken africans including slaves and free people numbered about 760,000—about 19.3% of the population in 1860 at the start of the civil war the african-american population had increased to 4.4 million but the percentage rate dropped to 14% of the overall population of the country the vast majority were slaves with only 488,000 counted as freemen by 1900 the black population had doubled and reached 8.8 million
in 1910 about 90% of african americans lived in the south large numbers began migrating north looking for better job opportunities and living conditions and to escape jim crow laws and racial violence the great migration as it was called spanned the 1890s to the 1970s from 1916 through the 1960s more than 6 million black people moved north but in the 1970s and 1980s that trend reversed with more african americans moving south to the sun belt than leaving it
the following table of the african-american population in the united states over time shows that the african-american population as a percentage of the total population declined until 1930 and has been rising since then
by 1990 the african-american population reached about 30 million and represented 12% of the us population roughly the same proportion as in 1900
at the time of the 2000 census 54.8% of african americans lived in the south in that year 17.6% of african americans lived in the northeast and 18.7% in the midwest while only 8.9% lived in the western states the west does have a sizable black population in certain areas however california the nations most populous state has the fifth largest african-american population only behind new york texas georgia and florida according to the 2000 census approximately 2.05% of african americans identified as hispanic or latino in origin many of whom may be of brazilian puerto rican dominican cuban haitian or other latin american descent the only self-reported ancestral groups larger than african americans are the irish and germans because many african americans trace their ancestry to colonial american origins some simply self-identify as american
according to the 2010 us census nearly 3% of people who self-identified as black had recent ancestors who immigrated from another country self-reported non-hispanic black immigrants from the caribbean mostly from jamaica and haiti represented 0.9% of the us population at 2.6 million self-reported black immigrants from sub-saharan africa also represented 0.9 at about 2.8 million additionally self-identified black hispanics represented 0.4% of the united states population at about 1.2 million people largely found within the puerto rican and dominican communities self-reported black immigrants hailing from other countries in the americas such as brazil and canada as well as several european countries represented less than 0.1% of the population mixed-race hispanic and non-hispanic americans who identified as being part black represented 0.9% of the population of the 12.6% of united states residents who identified as black around 10.3% were native black american or ethnic african americans who are direct descendants of westcentral africans brought to the us as slaves these individuals make up well over 80% of all blacks in the country when including people of mixed-race origin about 13.5% of the us population self-identified as black or mixed with black however according to the us census bureau evidence from the 2000 census indicates that many african and caribbean immigrant ethnic groups do not identify as black african am or negro instead they wrote in their own respective ethnic groups in the some other race write-in entry as a result the census bureau devised a new separate african american ethnic group category in 2010 for ethnic african americans following lobbying led by the arab american institute a national organization representing arab americans the census bureau also announced in 2014 that it may establish an additional new ethnic category for populations from the middle east north africa and the arab world


 us cities 

almost 58% of african americans lived in metropolitan areas in 2000 with over 2 million black residents new york city had the largest black urban population in the united states in 2000 overall the city has a 28% black population chicago has the second largest black population with almost 1.6 million african americans in its metropolitan area representing about 18 percent of the total metropolitan population
after 100 years of african-americans leaving the south in large numbers seeking better opportunities in the west and north a movement known as the great migration there is now a reverse trend called the new great migration a growing percentage of african-americans from the west and north are migrating to the southern region of the us for economic and cultural reasons new york city chicago and los angeles have the highest decline in african americans while atlanta dallas and houston have the highest increase respectively
among cities of 100,000 or more detroit michigan had the highest percentage of black residents of any us city in 2010 with 82 other large cities with african-american majorities include jackson mississippi 79.4 miami gardens florida 76.3 baltimore maryland 63 birmingham alabama 62.5 memphis tennessee 61 new orleans louisiana 60 montgomery alabama 56.6 flint michigan 56.6 savannah georgia 55.0 augusta georgia 54.7 atlanta georgia 54 see african americans in atlanta cleveland ohio 53.3 newark new jersey 52.35 washington dc 50.7 richmond virginia 50.6 mobile alabama 50.6 baton rouge louisiana 50.4 and shreveport louisiana 50.4
the nations most affluent community with an african-american majority resides in view park–windsor hills california with an annual median income of 159,618 other largely affluent predominately african-american communities include prince georges county in maryland namely mitchellville woodmore and upper marlboro dekalb county in georgia charles city county in virginia baldwin hills in california hillcrest and uniondale in new york and cedar hill desoto and missouri city in texas queens county new york is the only county with a population of 65,000 or more where african americans have a higher median household income than white americans
seatack virginia is currently the oldest african-american community in the united states it survives today with a vibrant and active civic community


 education 

by 2012 african americans had advanced greatly in education attainment they still lagged overall compared to white or asian americans but surpassed other ethnic minorities with 19 percent earning bachelors degrees and 6 percent earning advanced degrees between 1995 and 2009 freshmen college enrollment for african americans increased by 73 percent and only 15 percent for whites black women are enrolled in college more than any other race and gender group leading all with 9.7% enrolled according to the 2011 us census bureau predominantly black schools for kindergarten through twelfth grade students were common throughout the us before the 1970s by 1972 however desegregation efforts meant that only 25% of black students were in schools with more than 90% non-white students however since then a trend towards re-segregation affected communities across the country by 2011 2.9 million african-american students were in such overwhelmingly minority schools including 53% of black students in school districts that were formerly under desegregation orders
historically black colleges and universities hbcus which were originally set up when segregated colleges did not admit african americans continue to thrive and educate students of all races today the majority of hbcus were established in the southeastern united states alabama has the most hbcus of any state
as late as 1947 about one third of african americans over 65 were considered to lack the literacy to read and write their own names by 1969 illiteracy as it had been traditionally defined had been largely eradicated among younger african americans
us census surveys showed that by 1998 89 percent of african americans aged 25 to 29 had completed a high-school education less than whites or asians but more than hispanics on many college entrance standardized tests and grades african americans have historically lagged behind whites but some studies suggest that the achievement gap has been closing many policy makers have proposed that this gap can and will be eliminated through policies such as affirmative action desegregation and multiculturalism
the average high school graduation rate of blacks in the united states has steadily increased to 71% in 2013 separating this statistic into component parts shows it varies greatly depending upon the state and the school district examined 38% of black males graduated in the state of new york but in maine 97% graduated and exceeded the white male graduation rate by 11 percentage points in much of the southeastern united states and some parts of the southwestern united states the graduation rate of white males was in fact below 70% such as in florida where a 62% of white males graduated high school examining specific school districts paints an even more complex picture in the detroit school district the graduation rate of black males was 20% but 7% for white males in the new york city school district 28% of black males graduate high school compared to 57% of white males in newark county 76% of black males graduated compared to 67% for white males further academic improvement has occurred in 2015 roughly 23% of all blacks have bachelors degrees in 1988 21% of whites had obtained a bachelors degree versus 11% of blacks in 2015 23% of blacks had obtained a bachelors degree versus 36% of whites foreign born blacks 9% of the black population made even greater strides they exceed native born blacks by 10 percentage points
in chicago marva collins an african-american educator created a low cost private school specifically for the purpose of teaching low-income african-american children whom the public school system had labeled as being learning disabled one article about marva collins school stated

working with students having the worst of backgrounds those who were working far below grade level and even those who had been labeled as unteachable marva was able to overcome the obstacles news of third grade students reading at ninth grade level four-year-olds learning to read in only a few months outstanding test scores disappearance of behavioral problems second-graders studying shakespeare and other incredible reports astounded the public

during the 2006–2007 school year collins school charged 5,500 for tuition and parents said that the school did a much better job than the chicago public school system meanwhile during the 2007–2008 year chicago public school officials claimed that their budget of 11,300 per student was not enough


 economic status 

economically african americans have benefited from the advances made during the civil rights era particularly among the educated but not without the lingering effects of historical marginalization when considered as a whole the racial disparity in poverty rates has narrowed the black middle class has grown substantially in 2010 45% of african americans owned their homes compared to 67% of all americans the poverty rate among african americans has decreased from 26.5% in 1998 to 24.7% in 2004 compared to 12.7% for all americans

african americans have a combined buying power of over 892 billion currently and likely over 1.1 trillion by 2012 in 2002 african american-owned businesses accounted for 1.2 million of the uss 23 million businesses as of 2011 african american-owned businesses account for approximately 2 million us businesses black-owned businesses experienced the largest growth in number of businesses among minorities from 2002 to 2011
in 2004 african-american men had the third-highest earnings of american minority groups after asian americans and non-hispanic whites
twenty-five percent of blacks had white-collar occupations management professional and related fields in 2000 compared with 33.6% of americans overall in 2001 over half of african-american households of married couples earned 50,000 or more although in the same year african americans were over-represented among the nations poor this was directly related to the disproportionate percentage of african-american families headed by single women such families are collectively poorer regardless of ethnicity
in 2006 the median earnings of african-american men was more than black and non-black american women overall and in all educational levels at the same time among american men income disparities were significant the median income of african-american men was approximately 76 cents for every dollar of their european american counterparts although the gap narrowed somewhat with a rise in educational level
overall the median earnings of african-american men were 72 cents for every dollar earned of their asian american counterparts and 1.17 for every dollar earned by hispanic men on the other hand by 2006 among american women with post-secondary education african-american women have made significant advances the median income of african-american women was more than those of their asian- european- and hispanic american counterparts with at least some college education
the us public sector is the single most important source of employment for african americans during 2008–2010 21.2% of all black workers were public employees compared with 16.3% of non-black workers both before and after the onset of the great recession african americans were 30% more likely than other workers to be employed in the public sector
the public sector is also a critical source of decent-paying jobs for black americans for both men and women the median wage earned by black employees is significantly higher in the public sector than in other industries
in 1999 the median income of african-american families was 33,255 compared to 53,356 of european americans in times of economic hardship for the nation african americans suffer disproportionately from job loss and underemployment with the black underclass being hardest hit the phrase last hired and first fired is reflected in the bureau of labor statistics unemployment figures nationwide the october 2008 unemployment rate for african americans was 11.1 while the nationwide rate was 6.5
the income gap between black and white families is also significant in 2005 employed blacks earned 65% of the wages of whites down from 82% in 1975 the new york times reported in 2006 that in queens new york the median income among african-american families exceeded that of white families which the newspaper attributed to the growth in the number of two-parent black families it noted that queens was the only county with more than 65,000 residents where that was true
in 2011 it was reported that 72% of black babies were born to unwed mothers the poverty rate among single-parent black families was 39.5% in 2005 according to williams while it was 9.9% among married-couple black families among white families the respective rates were 26.4% and 6% in poverty


 health 

the life expectancy for black men in 2008 was 70.8 years life expectancy for black women was 77.5 years in 2008 in 1900 when information on black life expectancy started being collated a black man could expect to live to 32.5 years and a black woman 33.5 years in 1900 white men lived an average of 46.3 years and white women lived an average of 48.3 years african-american life expectancy at birth is persistently five to seven years lower than european americans
black people have higher rates of obesity diabetes and hypertension than the us average for adult black men the rate of obesity was 31.6% in 2010 for adult black women the rate of obesity was 41.2% in 2010 african americans have higher rates of mortality than does any other racial or ethnic group for 8 of the top 10 causes of death in 2013 among men black men had the highest rate of getting cancer followed by white hispanic asianpacific islander api and american indianalaska native aian men among women white women had the highest rate of getting cancer followed by black hispanic asianpacific islander and american indianalaska native women violence has an impact upon african-american life expectancy a report from the us department of justice states in 2005 homicide victimization rates for blacks were 6 times higher than the rates for whites the report also found that 94% of black victims were killed by blacks
aids is one of the top three causes of death for african-american men aged 25–54 and for african-american women aged 35–44 years in the united states african americans make up about 48% of the total hiv-positive population and make up more than half of new hiv cases the main route of transmission for women is through unprotected heterosexual sex african-american women are 19 times more likely to contract hiv than other women
washington dc has the nations highest rate of hivaids infection at 3 this rate is comparable to what is seen in west africa and is considered a severe epidemic dr ray martins chief medical officer at the whitman-walker clinic the largest provider of hiv care in washington dc estimated that the actual underlying percent with hivaids in the city is closer to five percent


 sexuality 
according to a gallup survey 4.6% of black or african-americans self-identified as lgbt in 2016 while the total portion of american adults in all ethnic groups identifying as lgbt was 4.1% in 2016 the disproportionately high incidence of hivaids among african-americans has been attributed to homophobic attitudes


 religion 

the majority of african americans are protestant many of whom follow the historically black churches the term black church refers to churches which minister to predominantly african-american congregations black congregations were first established by freed slaves at the end of the 17th century and later when slavery was abolished more african americans were allowed to create a unique form of christianity that was culturally influenced by african spiritual traditions
according to a 2007 survey more than half of the african-american population are part of the historically black churches the largest protestant denomination among african americans are the baptists distributed mainly in four denominations the largest being the national baptist convention usa and the national baptist convention of america the second largest are the methodists the largest denominations are the african methodist episcopal church and the african methodist episcopal zion church
pentecostals are distributed among several different religious bodies with the church of god in christ as the largest among them by far about 16% of african-american christians are members of white protestant communions these denominations which include the united church of christ mostly have a 2 to 3% african-american membership there are also large numbers of roman catholics constituting 5% of the african-american population of the total number of jehovahs witnesses 22% are black
some african americans follow islam historically between 15 and 30% of enslaved africans brought to the americas were muslims but most of these africans were converted to christianity during the era of american slavery during the twentieth century some african americans converted to islam mainly through the influence of black nationalist groups that preached with distinctive islamic practices including the moorish science temple of america and the largest organization the nation of islam founded in the 1930s which attracted at least 20,000 people by 1963 prominent members included activist malcolm x and boxer muhammad ali
malcolm x is considered the first person to start the movement among african americans towards mainstream islam after he left the nation and made the pilgrimage to mecca in 1975 warith deen mohammed the son of elijah muhammad took control of the nation after his fathers death and guided the majority of its members to orthodox islam however a few members rejected these changes in particular louis farrakhan who revived the nation of islam in 1978 based on its original teachings
african-american muslims constitute 20% of the total us muslim population the majority are sunni or orthodox muslims some of these identify under the community of w deen mohammed the nation of islam led by louis farrakhan has a membership ranging from 20,000–50,000 members
there are relatively few african-american jews estimates of their number range from 20,000 to 200,000 most of these jews are part of mainstream groups such as the reform conservative or orthodox branches of judaism although there are significant numbers of people who are part of non-mainstream jewish groups largely the black hebrew israelites whose beliefs include the claim that african americans are descended from the biblical israelites
confirmed atheists are less than one half of one-percent similar to numbers for hispanics


 business 
african americans have a long and diverse history of business ownership although the first african-american business is unknown slaves captured from west africa are believed to have established commercial enterprises as peddlers and skilled craftspeople as far back as the 17th century around 1900 booker t washington became the most famous proponent of african american businesses his critic and rival web dubois also commended business as a vehicle for african american advancement


 language 

african american english is a variety dialect ethnolect and sociolect of american english commonly spoken by urban working-class and largely bi-dialectal middle-class african americans non-linguists sometimes call it ebonics a term that also has other meanings and connotations
african american english evolved during the antebellum period through interaction between speakers of 16th and 17th century english of great britain and ireland and various west african languages as a result the variety shares parts of its grammar and phonology with the southern american english dialect where african american english differs from standard american english sae is in certain pronunciation characteristics tense usage and grammatical structures that were derived from west african languages particularly those belonging to the niger-congo family
virtually all habitual speakers of african american english can understand and communicate in standard american english as with all linguistic forms aaves usage is influenced by various factors including geographical educational and socioeconomic background as well as formality of setting additionally there are many literary uses of this variety of english particularly in african-american literature

recent surveys of african americans using a genetic testing service have found varied ancestries which show different tendencies by region and sex of ancestors these studies found that on average african americans have 73.2-82.1% west african 16.7-24% european and 0.8–1.2% native american genetic ancestry with large variation between individuals genetics websites themselves have reported similar ranges with some finding 1 or 2 percent native american ancestry and ancestrycom reporting an outlying percentage of european ancestry among african americans 29
according to a genome-wide study by bryc et al 2009 the overall ancestry of african americans was formed through historic admixture between westcentral africans more frequently females and europeans more frequently males consequently the 365 african americans in their sample have a genome-wide average of 78.1% west african ancestry and 18.5% european ancestry with large variation among individuals ranging from 99% to 1% west african ancestry the west african ancestral component in african americans is most similar to that in present-day speakers from the non-bantu branches of the niger-congo niger-kordofanian family
correspondingly montinaro et al 2014 observed that around 50% of the overall ancestry of african americans traces back to the niger-congo-speaking yoruba of southwestern nigeria and southern benin reflecting the centrality of this west africa region in the atlantic slave trade the next most frequent ancestral component found among african americans was derived from great britain in keeping with historical records it constitutes a little over 10% of their overall ancestry and is most similar to the northwest european ancestral component also carried by barbadians zakharaia et al 2009 found a similar proportion of yoruba associated ancestry in their african-american samples with a minority also drawn from mandenka and bantu populations additionally the researchers observed an average european ancestry of 21.9 again with significant variation between individuals bryc et al 2009 note that populations from other parts of the continent may also constitute adequate proxies for the ancestors of some african-american individuals namely ancestral populations from guinea bissau senegal and sierra leone in west africa and angola in southern africa
altogether genetic studies suggest that african americans are a multiracial people according to dna analysis led in 2006 by penn state geneticist mark d shriver around 58 percent of african americans have at least 12.5% european ancestry equivalent to one european great-grandparent and hisher forebears 19.6 percent of african americans have at least 25% european ancestry equivalent to one european grandparent and hisher forebears and 1 percent of african americans have at least 50% european ancestry equivalent to one european parent and hisher forebears according to shriver around 5 percent of african americans also have at least 12.5% native american ancestry equivalent to one native american great-grandparent and hisher forebears


 y-dna 
according to a y-dna study by sims et al 2007 the majority 60 of african americans belong to various subclades of the e3a e1b1a paternal haplogroup this is the most common genetic paternal lineage found today among westcentral african males and is also a signature of the historical bantu migrations the next most frequent y-dna haplogroup observed among african americans is the r1b clade which around 15% of african americans carry this lineage is most common today among northwestern european males the remaining african americans mainly belong to the paternal haplogroup i 7 which is also frequent in northwestern europe


 mtdna 
according to an mtdna study by salas et al 2005 the maternal lineages of african americans are most similar to haplogroups that are today especially common in west africa 55 followed closely by west-central africa and southwestern africa 41 the characteristic west african haplogroups l1b l2bcd and l3bd and west-central african haplogroups l1c and l3e in particular occur at high frequencies among african americans as with the paternal dna of african americans contributions from other parts of the continent to their maternal gene pool are insignificant


 traditional names 

african-american names are part of the cultural traditions of african americans prior to the 1950s and 1960s most african-american names closely resembled those used within european american culture babies of that era were generally given a few common names with children using nicknames to distinguish the various people with the same name with the rise of 1960s civil rights movement there was a dramatic increase in names of various origins
by the 1970s and 1980s it had become common among african americans to invent new names for themselves although many of these invented names took elements from popular existing names prefixes such as lale dade rare and jaje and suffixes like -iqueiqua -isha and -aun-awn are common as are inventive spellings for common names the book baby names now from classic to cool--the very last word on first names places the origins of la names in african-american culture in new orleans
even with the rise of inventive names it is still common for african americans to use biblical historical or traditional european names daniel christopher michael david james joseph and matthew were thus among the most frequent names for african-american boys in 2013
the name lakeisha is typically considered american in origin but has elements of it that were drawn from both french and westcentral african roots other names like latanisha jamarcus deandre and shaniqua were created in the same way punctuation marks are seen more often within african-american names than other american names such as the names monique and dandre


 contemporary issues 

african americans have improved their social and economic standing significantly since the civil rights movement and recent decades have witnessed the expansion of a robust african-american middle class across the united states unprecedented access to higher education and employment in addition to representation in the highest levels of american government has been gained by african americans in the post–civil rights era
one of the most serious and long-standing issues within african-american communities is poverty poverty is associated with higher rates of marital stress and dissolution physical and mental health problems disability cognitive deficits low educational attainment and crime in 2004 almost 25% of african-american families lived below the poverty level in 2007 the average income for african americans was approximately 34,000 compared to 55,000 for whites forty percent of prison inmates are african american african americans experience a higher rate of unemployment than the general population african american males are more likely to be killed by police this is one of the factors that led to the creation of the black lives matter movement


 politics and social issues 

collectively african americans are more involved in the american political process than other minority groups in the united states indicated by the highest level of voter registration and participation in elections among these groups in 2004 african americans collectively attain higher levels of education than immigrants to the united states african americans also have the highest level of congressional representation of any minority group in the us
a large majority of african americans support the democratic party in the 2004 presidential election democrat john kerry received 88% of the african-american vote compared to 11% for republican george w bush although there is an african-american lobby in foreign policy it has not had the impact that african-american organizations have had in domestic policy
many african americans were excluded from electoral politics in the decades following the end of reconstruction for those that could participate until the new deal african americans were supporters of the republican party because it was republican president abraham lincoln who helped in granting freedom to american slaves at the time the republicans and democrats represented the sectional interests of the north and south respectively rather than any specific ideology and both right and left were represented equally in both parties
the african-american trend of voting for democrats can be traced back to the 1930s during the great depression when franklin d roosevelts new deal program provided economic relief to african americans roosevelts new deal coalition turned the democratic party into an organization of the working class and their liberal allies regardless of region the african-american vote became even more solidly democratic when democratic presidents john f kennedy and lyndon b johnson pushed for civil rights legislation during the 1960s in 1960 nearly a third of african americans voted for republican richard nixon
after over 50 years marriage rates for all americans began to decline while divorce rates and out-of-wedlock births have climbed these changes have been greatest among african americans after more than 70 years of racial parity black marriage rates began to fall behind whites single-parent households have become common and according to us census figures released in january 2010 only 38 percent of black children live with both their parents
in 2008 democrats overwhelmingly voted 70% against california proposition 8 african americans voted 58% in favor of it while 42% voted against proposition 8 on may 9 2012 barack obama the first black president became the first us president to support same-sex marriage after obamas endorsement there is a rapid growth in support for same-sex marriage among african americans now 59% of african americans support same-sex marriage which is higher than support among the national average 53 and white americans 50
polls in north carolina pennsylvania missouri maryland ohio florida and nevada have also shown an increase in support for same sex marriage among african americans on november 6 2012 maryland maine and washington all voted for approve of same-sex marriage along with minnesota rejecting a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage exit polls in maryland show about 50% of african americans voted for same-sex marriage showing a vast evolution among african americans on the issue and was crucial in helping pass same-sex marriage in maryland
blacks hold far more conservative opinions on abortion extramarital sex and raising children out of wedlock than democrats as a whole on financial issues however african americans are in line with democrats generally supporting a more progressive tax structure to provide more government spending on social services


 political legacy 

african americans have fought in every war in the history of the united states
the gains made by african americans in the civil rights movement and in the black power movement not only obtained certain rights for african americans but changed american society in far-reaching and fundamentally important ways prior to the 1950s black americans in the south were subject to de jure discrimination or jim crow laws they were often the victims of extreme cruelty and violence sometimes resulting in deaths by the post world war ii era african americans became increasingly discontented with their long-standing inequality in the words of martin luther king jr african americans and their supporters challenged the nation to rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed that all men are created equal 
the civil rights movement marked an enormous change in american social political economic and civic life it brought with it boycotts sit-ins nonviolent demonstrations and marches court battles bombings and other violence prompted worldwide media coverage and intense public debate forged enduring civic economic and religious alliances and disrupted and realigned the nations two major political parties
over time it has changed in fundamental ways the manner in which blacks and whites interact with and relate to one another the movement resulted in the removal of codified de jure racial segregation and discrimination from american life and law and heavily influenced other groups and movements in struggles for civil rights and social equality within american society including the free speech movement the disabled the womens movement native americans and migrant workers


 news media and coverage 

some activists and academics contend that news media coverage of african-american news concerns or dilemmas is inadequate or the news media present distorted images of african americans to combat this robert l johnson founded black entertainment television a network that targets young african americans and urban audiences in the united states most programming on the network consists of rap and rb music videos and urban-oriented movies and series the channel also shows syndicated television series original programs and some public affairs programs on sunday mornings bet broadcasts a lineup of network-produced christian programming other non-affiliated christian programs are also shown during the early morning hours daily bet is now a global network that reaches 90 million households in the united states caribbean canada and the united kingdom
in addition to bet there is bet her which is a spin-off cable television channel of bet created originally as bet on jazz to showcase jazz music-related programming especially that of black jazz musicians programming has been expanded to include a block of urban programs as well as some rb soul and world music
tv one is another african-american-oriented network and a direct competitor to bet targeting african-american adults with a broad range of programming the network airs original lifestyle and entertainment-oriented shows movies fashion and music programming as well as classic series such as 227 good times martin boston public and its showtime at the apollo the network primarily owned by radio one founded and controlled by catherine hughes it is one of the nations largest radio broadcasting companies and the largest african-american-owned radio broadcasting company in the united states
other african-american networks scheduled to launch in 2009 are the black television news channel founded by former congressman j c watts and better black television founded by percy miller in june 2009 nbc news launched a new website named the grio in partnership with the production team that created the black documentary film meeting david wilson it is the first african-american video news site that focuses on underrepresented stories in existing national news the grio consists of a broad spectrum of original video packages news articles and contributor blogs on topics including breaking news politics health business entertainment and black history


 culture in the united states 

from their earliest presence in north america african americans have significantly contributed literature art agricultural skills cuisine clothing styles music language and social and technological innovation to american culture the cultivation and use of many agricultural products in the united states such as yams peanuts rice okra sorghum grits watermelon indigo dyes and cotton can be traced to west african and african-american influences notable examples include george washington carver who created 300 products from peanuts 118 products from sweet potatoes and 75 products from pecans and george crum a local legend associates him with the creation of the potato chip in 1853 soul food is a variety of cuisine popular among african americans it is closely related to the cuisine of the southern united states the descriptive terminology may have originated in the mid-1960s when soul was a common definer used to describe african-american culture for example soul music african americans were the first peoples in the united states to make fried chicken along with scottish immigrants to the south although the scottish had been frying chicken before they emigrated they lacked the spices and flavor that african americans had used when preparing the meal the scottish american settlers therefore adopted the african-american method of seasoning chicken however fried chicken was generally a rare meal in the african-american community and was usually reserved for special events or celebrations


 music 

african-american music is one of the most pervasive african-american cultural influences in the united states today and is among the most dominant in mainstream popular music hip hop rb funk rock and roll soul blues and other contemporary american musical forms originated in black communities and evolved from other black forms of music including blues doo-wop barbershop ragtime bluegrass jazz and gospel music
african-american-derived musical forms have also influenced and been incorporated into virtually every other popular music genre in the world including country and techno african-american genres are the most important ethnic vernacular tradition in america as they have developed independent of african traditions from which they arise more so than any other immigrant groups including europeans make up the broadest and longest lasting range of styles in america and have historically been more influential interculturally geographically and economically than other american vernacular traditions
african americans have also had an important role in american dance bill t jones a prominent modern choreographer and dancer has included historical african-american themes in his work particularly in the piece last supper at uncle toms cabinthe promised land likewise alvin aileys artistic work including his revelations based on his experience growing up as an african american in the south during the 1930s has had a significant influence on modern dance another form of dance stepping is an african-american tradition whose performance and competition has been formalized through the traditionally black fraternities and sororities at universities


 literature and academics 
many african-american authors have written stories poems and essays influenced by their experiences as african americans african-american literature is a major genre in american literature famous examples include langston hughes james baldwin richard wright zora neale hurston ralph ellison nobel prize winner toni morrison and maya angelou
african-american inventors have created many widely used devices in the world and have contributed to international innovation norbert rillieux created the technique for converting sugar cane juice into white sugar crystals moreover rillieux left louisiana in 1854 and went to france where he spent ten years working with the champollions deciphering egyptian hieroglyphics from the rosetta stone most slave inventors were nameless such as the slave owned by the confederate president jefferson davis who designed the ship propeller used by the confederate navy
by 1913 over 1,000 inventions were patented by black americans among the most notable inventors were jan matzeliger who developed the first machine to mass-produce shoes and elijah mccoy who invented automatic lubrication devices for steam engines granville woods had 35 patents to improve electric railway systems including the first system to allow moving trains to communicate garrett a morgan developed the first automatic traffic signal and gas mask
lewis howard latimer invented an improvement for the incandescent light bulb more recent inventors include frederick mckinley jones who invented the movable refrigeration unit for food transport in trucks and trains lloyd quarterman worked with six other black scientists on the creation of the atomic bomb code named the manhattan project quarterman also helped develop the first nuclear reactor which was used in the atomically powered submarine called the nautilus
a few other notable examples include the first successful open heart surgery performed by dr daniel hale williams and the air conditioner patented by frederick mckinley jones dr mark dean holds three of the original nine patents on the computer on which all pcs are based more current contributors include otis boykin whose inventions included several novel methods for manufacturing electrical components that found use in applications such as guided missile systems and computers and colonel frederick gregory who was not only the first black astronaut pilot but the person who redesigned the cockpits for the last three space shuttles gregory was also on the team that pioneered the microwave instrumentation landing system


 terminology 


 general 

the term african american carries important political overtones earlier terms used to describe americans of african ancestry referred more to skin color than to ancestry and were conferred upon the group by colonists and americans of european ancestry people with dark skins were considered inferior in fact and in law other terms such as colored person of color or negro were included in the wording of various laws and legal decisions which some thought were being used as tools of white supremacy and oppression

in the 1980s the term african american was advanced on the model of for example german-american or irish-american to give descendants of american slaves and other american blacks who lived through the slavery era a heritage and a cultural base the term was popularized in black communities around the country via word of mouth and ultimately received mainstream use after jesse jackson publicly used the term in front of a national audience in 1988 subsequently major media outlets adopted its use
surveys show that the majority of black americans have no preference for african american versus black american although they have a slight preference for black american in personal settings and african american in more formal settings
many african americans have expressed a preference for the term african american because it was formed in the same way as the terms for the many other ethnic groups currently living in the nation some argued further that because of the historical circumstances surrounding the capture enslavement and systematic attempts to de-africanize blacks in the united states under chattel slavery most african americans are unable to trace their ancestry to a specific african nation hence the entire continent serves as a geographic marker
the term african american embraces pan-africanism as earlier enunciated by prominent african thinkers such as marcus garvey w e b du bois and george padmore the term afro-usonian and variations of such are more rarely used


 identity 
since 1977 in an attempt to keep up with changing social opinion the united states government has officially classified black people revised to black or african american in 1997 as having origins in any of the black racial groups of africa other federal offices such as the united states census bureau adhere to the office of management and budget standards on race in its data collection and tabulations efforts in preparation for the united states 2010 census a marketing and outreach plan called 2010 census integrated communications campaign plan icc recognized and defined african americans as black people born in the united states from the icc perspective african americans are one of three groups of black people in the united states
the icc plan was to reach the three groups by acknowledging that each group has its own sense of community that is based on geography and ethnicity the best way to market the census process toward any of the three groups is to reach them through their own unique communication channels and not treat the entire black population of the us as though they are all african americans with a single ethnic and geographical background the us department of justice federal bureau of investigation categorizes black or african-american people as a person having origins in any of the black racial groups of africa through racial categories used in the ucr program adopted from the statistical policy handbook 1978 and published by the office of federal statistical policy and standards us department of commerce derived from the 1977 office of management and budget classification


 admixture 

historically race mixing between black and white people was taboo in the united states so-called anti-miscegenation laws barring blacks and whites from marrying or having sex were established in colonial america as early as 1691 and endured in many southern states until the supreme court ruled them unconstitutional in loving v virginia 1967 the taboo among american whites surrounding white-black relations is a historical consequence of the oppression and racial segregation of african americans historian david brion davis notes the racial mixing that occurred during slavery was frequently attributed by the planter class to the lower-class white males but davis concludes that there is abundant evidence that many slaveowners sons of slaveowners and overseers took black mistresses or in effect raped the wives and daughters of slave families a famous example was thomas jeffersons mistress sally hemings
harvard university historian henry louis gates jr wrote in 2009 that african americans  are a racially mixed or mulatto people—deeply and overwhelmingly so see genetics after the emancipation proclamation chinese american men married african-american women in high proportions to their total marriage numbers due to few chinese american women being in the united states african slaves and their descendants have also had a history of cultural exchange and intermarriage with native americans although they did not necessarily retain social cultural or linguistic ties to native peoples there are also increasing intermarriages and offspring between non-hispanic blacks and hispanics of any race especially between puerto ricans and african americans american-born blacks according to author mm drymon many african americans identify as having scots-irish ancestry
racially mixed marriages have become increasingly accepted in the united states since the civil rights movement and up to the present day approval in national opinion polls have risen from 36% in 1978 to 48% in 1991 65% in 2002 77% in 2007 a gallup poll conducted in 2013 found that 84% of whites and 96% of blacks approved of interracial marriage and 87% overall


 the african-american experience 
in her book the end of blackness as well as in an essay on the liberal website salon author debra dickerson has argued that the term black should refer strictly to the descendants of africans who were brought to america as slaves and not to the sons and daughters of black immigrants who lack that ancestry in her opinion president barack obama who is the son of a kenyan immigrant although technically black is not african-american she makes the argument that grouping all people of african descent together regardless of their unique ancestral circumstances would inevitably deny the lingering effects of slavery within the american community of slave descendants in addition to denying black immigrants recognition of their own unique ancestral backgrounds lumping us all together dickerson wrote erases the significance of slavery and continuing racism while giving the appearance of progress
similar viewpoints have been expressed by stanley crouch in a new york daily news piece charles steele jr of the southern christian leadership conference and african-american columnist david ehrenstein of the los angeles times who accused white liberals of flocking to blacks who were magic negros a term that refers to a black person with no past who simply appears to assist the mainstream white as cultural protagonistsdrivers agenda ehrenstein went on to say hes there to assuage white guilt they feel over the role of slavery and racial segregation in american history
former secretary of state condoleezza rice who was famously mistaken for a recent american immigrant by french president nicolas sarkozy said descendants of slaves did not get much of a head start and i think you continue to see some of the effects of that she has also rejected an immigrant designation for african americans and instead prefers the term black or white to denote the african and european us founding populations


 terms no longer in common use 
before the independence of the thirteen colonies until the abolition of slavery in 1865 an african-american slave was commonly known as a negro free negro was the legal status in the territory of an african-american person who was not a slave the term colored later also began to be used until the second quarter of the 20th century when it was considered outmoded and generally gave way again to the exclusive use of negro by the 1940s the term was commonly capitalized negro but by the mid-1960s it was considered disparaging by the end of the 20th century negro had come to be considered inappropriate and was rarely used and perceived as a pejorative the term is rarely used by younger black people but remained in use by many older african americans who had grown up with the term particularly in the southern us the term remains in use in some contexts such as the united negro college fund an american philanthropic organization that funds scholarships for black students and general scholarship funds for 39 private historically black colleges and universities as well as in latin america where spanish and portuguese are spoken pronounced slightly differently it is the word for the color black and is rarely perceived as a pejorative
there are many other deliberately insulting terms many were in common use eg nigger but had become unacceptable in normal discourse before the end of the 20th century one exception is the use among the black community of the slur nigger rendered as nigga representing the pronunciation of the word in african american english this usage has been popularized by the rap and hip-hop music cultures and is used as part of an in-group lexicon and speech it is not necessarily derogatory and when used among black people the word is often used to mean homie or friend
acceptance of intra-group usage of the word nigga is still debated although it has established a foothold among younger generations the naacp denounces the use of both nigga and nigger mixed-race usage of nigga is still considered taboo particularly if the speaker is white however trends indicate that usage of the term in intragroup settings is increasing even among white youth due to the popularity of rap and hip hop culture
