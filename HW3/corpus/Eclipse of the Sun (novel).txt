 reception 
mary loudon writing in the times states that despite never having been to india the author has managed with exquisite sensitivity to capture the feel and the tone of the country its contrasts its self-doubt and its self-confidence despite imperialism and partitionits profound sense of history and its ingrained cultural beliefs even more than this however he has managed to create in despande a convincing hero a man both arrogant and diffident passionate and insensitive loudon does criticize the novels lack of pace and colour explaining that to set up a debate about science versus religion in contemporary india is a great idea but the execution of it is a little slow and a little dry and to my mind the novel is too long but she concludes nevertheless whitaker is a thoughtful and imaginative writer who bends to his subject and characters with rare humility and commitment he is yet to find a confident authorial voice and a strong identifying style but with time he may well do so
james simmons in the spectator has no such reservations and calls the novel a little masterpiece writing because of its familiar subject and the naivet√© of the characters one might be inclined to put this book aside after the first chapter but it is well worth persevering with because whitaker is so genuinely inventive the characters are always surprising you and contributing something subtle and interesting to the theme perhaps economy is the key to whitakers brilliance nothing is overdone
trevor lewis in the sunday times is also positive it is a pleasant surprise to find an english writer who deftly evokes both the peculiar flavours of modern indian life and the rhythms of subcontinental literature as a whole whitakers novel plays off the themes of rationalism and spirituality sculpting them into a leisurely comedy and concludes a generously humoured genuinely humane account of infatuation and heartbreak
