antoine caron 1521–1599 was a french master glassmaker illustrator northern mannerist painter and a product of the school of fontainebleau
he is one of the few french painters of his time who had a pronounced artistic personality his work reflects the refined although highly unstable atmosphere at the court of the house of valois during the french wars of religion of 1560 to 1598


 life 
caron was born in beauvais
he began painting in his teens doing frescos for a number of churches between 1540 and 1550 he worked under primaticcio and niccolò dellabbate at the school of fontainebleau in 1561 he was appointed the court painter by catherine de medici and henry ii of france as court painter he also had the duties of organizing the court pageants in this way he was involved in organizing the ceremony and royal entry for the coronation of charles ix in paris and the wedding of henry iv of france with marguerite de valois some of his surviving illustrations are from these pageants
his drawings of festivities at the court of charles ix are likely sources for the depiction of the court in the valois tapestries he died in paris in 1599


 art 

not many of caron’s works survive but they include historical and allegorical subjects court ceremonies astrological scenes and his massacres done in the mid-1560s an example is his only signed and dated painting massacres under the triumvirate 1566 which hangs in the louvre caron used bright colors and incorporated unusual architectural forms he often placed his human figures almost insignificantly on grand stages as did his mentor dellabbate his figures tend to be elongated even in portraits such as portrait of a lady 1577
many works attributed to him are also attributed to others as there is minimal documentation of french painting in that era this is not unusual because caron is relatively well known his name is likely to be attached to paintings similar to his known works in some cases such painting are now ascribed to the workshop of antoine caron for example the submission of milan to francis i in 1515 c1570
