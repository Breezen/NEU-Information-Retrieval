 history 


 origin of the name 
according to folklore notably celebrated by a statue in front of the town hall the city got its name from a legend about a giant called antigoon who lived near the scheldt river he exacted a toll from passing boatmen and for those who refused he severed one of their hands and threw it into the river eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named silvius brabo who cut off the giants own hand and flung it into the river hence the name antwerpen from dutch hand werpen akin to old english hand and wearpan to throw which has evolved to todays warp
a longstanding theory is that the name originated in the gallo-roman period and comes from the latin antverpia antverpia would come from ante before verpia deposition sedimentation indicating land that forms by deposition in the inside curve of a river which is in fact the same origin as germanic waerpen note that the river scheldt before a transition period between 600 and 750 followed a different track this must have coincided roughly with the current ringway south of the city situating the city within a former curve of the river however many historians think it unlikely that there was a large settlement which would be named antverpia but more something like an outpost with a river crossing
however john lothrop motley argues and so do a lot of dutch etymologists and historians that antwerps name derives from anda at and werpum wharf to give an t werf on the wharf in the same meaning as the current english wharf aan t werp at the warp is also possible this warp thrown ground is a man-made hill or a river deposit high enough to remain dry at high tide whereupon a construction could be built that would remain dry another word for werp is pol dyke hence polders the dry land behind a dyke that was no longer flooded by the tide
alfred michiels has suggested that derivations based on hand werpen antverpia on the wharf or at the warp” lack historical backing in the form of recorded past spellings of the placename he points instead to dado’s life of st eligius vita eligii from the 7th century which records the form andoverpis he sees in it a celtic origin indicating “those who live on both banks”


 pre-1500 
historical antwerp allegedly had its origins in a gallo-roman vicus excavations carried out in the oldest section near the scheldt 1952–1961 ref princeton produced pottery shards and fragments of glass from mid-2nd century to the end of the 3rd century the earliest mention of antwerp dates from the 4th century
in the 4th century antwerp was first named having been settled by the germanic franks
the merovingian antwerp was evangelized by saint amand in the 7th century at the end of the 10th century the scheldt became the boundary of the holy roman empire antwerp became a margraviate in 980 by the german emperor otto ii a border province facing the county of flanders
in the 11th century godfrey of bouillon was for some years known as the marquis of antwerp in the 12th century norbert of xanten established a community of his premonstratensian canons at st michaels abbey at caloes antwerp was also the headquarters of edward iii during his early negotiations with jacob van artevelde and his son lionel the duke of clarence was born there in 1338


 16th century 

after the silting-up of the zwin and the consequent decline of bruges the city of antwerp then part of the duchy of brabant grew in importance at the end of the 15th century the foreign trading houses were transferred from bruges to antwerp and the building assigned to the english nation is specifically mentioned in 1510 antwerp became the sugar capital of europe importing the raw commodity from portuguese and spanish plantations the city attracted italian and german sugar refiners by 1550 and shipped their refined product to germany especially cologne moneylenders and financiers developed a large business lending money all over europe including the english government in 1544–1574 london bankers were too small to operate on that scale and antwerp had a highly efficient bourse that itself attracted rich bankers from around europe after the 1570s the citys banking business declined england ended its borrowing in antwerp in 1574
fernand braudel states that antwerp became the centre of the entire international economy something bruges had never been even at its height antwerp was the richest city in europe at this time antwerps golden age is tightly linked to the age of exploration during the first half of the 16th century antwerp grew to become the second-largest european city north of the alps many foreign merchants were resident in the city francesco guicciardini the venetian envoy stated that hundreds of ships would pass in a day and 2,000 carts entered the city each week portuguese ships laden with pepper and cinnamon would unload their cargo according to luc-normand tellier it is estimated that the port of antwerp was earning the spanish crown seven times more revenues than the americas

without a long-distance merchant fleet and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade the economy of antwerp was foreigner-controlled which made the city very cosmopolitan with merchants and traders from venice ragusa spain and portugal antwerp had a policy of toleration which attracted a large crypto-jewish community composed of migrants from spain and portugal
by 1504 the portuguese had established antwerp as one of their main shipping bases bringing in spices from asia and trading them for textiles and metal goods the cities trade expanded to include cloth from england italy and germany wines from germany france and spain salt from france and wheat from the baltic the cities skilled workers processed soap fish sugar and especially cloth banks helped finance the trade the merchants and the manufacturers the city was a cosmopolitan center its bourse opened in 1531 to the merchants of all nations 
antwerp experienced three booms during its golden age the first based on the pepper market a second launched by american silver coming from seville ending with the bankruptcy of spain in 1557 and a third boom after the stabilising treaty of cateau-cambresis in 1559 based on the textiles industry at the beginning of the 16th century antwerp accounted for 40% of world trade the boom-and-bust cycles and inflationary cost-of-living squeezed less-skilled workers in the century after 1541 the citys economy and population declined dramatically the portuguese merchants left in 1549 and there was much less trade in english cloth numerous financial bankruptcies began around 1557 amsterdam replaced antwerp as the major trading center for the region


 reformation era 

the religious revolution of the reformation erupted in violent riots in august 1566 as in other parts of the low countries the regent margaret duchess of parma was swept aside when philip ii sent the duke of alba at the head of an army the following summer when the eighty years war broke out in 1568 commercial trading between antwerp and the spanish port of bilbao collapsed and became impossible on 4 november 1576 spanish soldiers sacked the city during the so-called spanish fury 7,000 citizens were massacred 800 houses were burnt down and over £2 million sterling of damage was done


 dutch revolt 
subsequently the city joined the union of utrecht in 1579 and became the capital of the dutch revolt in 1585 alessandro farnese duke of parma and piacenza captured it after a long siege and as part of the terms of surrender its protestant citizens were given two years to settle their affairs before quitting the city most went to the united provinces in the north starting the dutch golden age antwerps banking was controlled for a generation by genoa and amsterdam became the new trading centre


 17th–19th centuries 

the recognition of the independence of the united provinces by the treaty of münster in 1648 stipulated that the scheldt should be closed to navigation which destroyed antwerps trading activities this impediment remained in force until 1863 although the provisions were relaxed during french rule from 1795 to 1814 and also during the time belgium formed part of the kingdom of the united netherlands 1815 to 1830 antwerp had reached the lowest point in its fortunes in 1800 and its population had sunk to under 40,000 when napoleon realizing its strategic importance assigned funds to enlarge the harbour by constructing a new dock still named the bonaparte dock and an access- lock and mole and deepening the scheldt to allow for larger ships to approach antwerp napoleon hoped that by making antwerps harbour the finest in europe he would be able to counter the port of london and hamper british growth however he was defeated at the battle of waterloo before he could see the plan through

in 1830 the city was captured by the belgian insurgents but the citadel continued to be held by a dutch garrison under general david hendrik chassé for a time chassé subjected the town to periodic bombardment which inflicted much damage and at the end of 1832 the citadel itself was besieged by the french northern army commanded by marechal gerard during this attack the town was further damaged in december 1832 after a gallant defence chassé made an honourable surrender ending the siege of antwerp 1832
later that century a double ring of brialmont fortresses was constructed some 10 km 6 mi from the city centre as antwerp was considered vital for the survival of the young belgian state and in the last decade antwerp presented itself to the world via a worlds fair attended by 3 million


 20th century 

antwerp was the first city to host the world gymnastics championships in 1903 during world war i the city became the fallback point of the belgian army after the defeat at liège the siege of antwerp lasted for 11 days but the city was taken after heavy fighting by the german army and the belgians were forced to retreat westwards antwerp remained under german occupation until the armistice
antwerp hosted the 1920 summer olympics during world war ii the city was an important strategic target because of its port it was occupied by germany in may 1940 and liberated by the british 11th armoured division on 4 september 1944 after this the germans attempted to destroy the port of antwerp which was used by the allies to bring new material ashore thousands of rheinbote v-1 and v-2 missiles were fired more v-2s than used on all other targets during the entire war combined causing severe damage to the city but failed to destroy the port due to poor accuracy after the war antwerp which had already had a sizeable jewish population before the war once again became a major european centre of haredi and particularly hasidic orthodox judaism
a ten-year plan for the port of antwerp 1956–1965 expanded and modernized the ports infrastructure with national funding to build a set of canal docks the broader aim was to facilitate the growth of the north-eastern antwerp metropolitan region which attracted new industry based on a flexible and strategic implementation of the project as a co-production between various authorities and private parties the plan succeeded in extending the linear layout along the scheldt river by connecting new satellite communities to the main strip
starting in the 1990s antwerp rebranded itself as a world-class fashion centre emphasizing the avant-garde it tried to compete with london milan new york and paris it emerged from organized tourism and mega-cultural events

daily congestion on the ring led to a fourth high-volume highway link called the oosterweelconnection being proposed it would have entailed the construction of a long viaduct and bridge the lange wapper over the docks on the north side of the city in combination with the widening of the existing motorway into a 14-lane motorway these plans were eventually rejected in a 2009 public referendum
in september 2010 the flemish government decided to replace the bridge by a series of tunnels there are ideas to cover the ring in a similar way as happened around paris hamburg madrid and other cities this would reconnect the city with its suburbs and would provide development opportunities to accommodate part of the foreseen population growth in antwerp which currently are not possible because of the pollution and noise generated by the traffic on the ring an old plan to build an r2 outer ring road outside the built up urban area around the antwerp agglomeration for port related traffic and transit traffic never materialized
