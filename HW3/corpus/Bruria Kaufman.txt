bruria kaufman august 21 1918 – january 7 2010 was an israeli theoretical physicist she is known for contributions to albert einsteins general theory of relativity to statistical physics where she used applied spinor analysis to rederive the result of lars onsager on the partition function of the two-dimensional ising model and to the study of the mössbauer effect on which she collaborated with john von neumann and harry lipkin


 biography 

bruria kaufman was born in new york city to a jewish family of russian origin in 1926 the family immigrated to the british mandate for palestine living first in tel aviv and then in jerusalem her main interests during her youth were music and mathematics
she studied mathematics earning a bsc from hebrew university of jerusalem in 1938 and a phd from columbia university in 1948 she married the linguist zellig s harris in 1941
in 1960 she settled on kibbutz mishmar haemek and adopted a daughter tamar

 scientific career 
kaufman was a research associate at the institute for advanced study in princeton from 1948 to 1955 where she worked with john von neumann 1947/48 and with albert einstein 1950–1955 she spent the following years at the university of pennsylvania working on a mathematical linguistics project
kaufman returned to israel in 1960 with harris where she became professor at the weizmann institute of science in rehovot 1960–1971 and later on at the university of haifa 1972–1988
