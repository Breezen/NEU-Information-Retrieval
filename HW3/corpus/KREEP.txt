kreep an acronym built from the letters k the atomic symbol for potassium ree rare-earth elements and p for phosphorus is a geochemical component of some lunar impact breccia and basaltic rocks its most significant feature is somewhat enhanced concentration of a majority of so-called incompatible elements those that are concentrated in the liquid phase during magma crystallization and the heat-producing elements namely radioactive uranium thorium and potassium due to presence of the radioactive 40k


 typical composition 
the typical composition of kreep includes about one percent by mass of potassium and phosphorus oxides 20 to 25 parts per million of rubidium and a concentration of the element lanthanum that is 300 to 350 times the concentrations found in carbonaceous chondrites


 possible origin 
indirectly it has been deduced that the origin of kreep is contained in the origin of the moon this is now commonly thought to be the result of a rocky object the size of mars that struck the earth about 4.5 billion 4.5×109 years ago this collision threw a large amount of broken rock into orbit around the earth this ultimately gathered together to form the moon
given the high energy such a collision would involve it has been deduced that a large portion of the moon would have been liquified and this formed a lunar magma ocean as the crystallization of this liquid rock proceeded minerals such as olivine and pyroxene precipitated and sank to the bottom to form the lunar mantle
after the solidification was about 75% complete the material anorthositic plagioclase began to crystallize and because of its low density it floated forming a solid crust hence elements that are usually incompatible ie those that usually partition in the liquid phase would have been progressively concentrated into the magma thus a kreep-rich magma was formed that was sandwiched at first between the crust and mantle the evidence for these processes comes from the highly anorthositic composition of the crust of the lunar highlands as well as the presence of the rocks rich in kreep


 lunar prospector measurements 
before the mission of lunar prospector lunar satellite it was commonly thought that these kreep materials had been formed in a widespread layer beneath the crust however the measurements from the gamma-ray spectrometer on-board this satellite showed that the kreep-containing rocks are primarily concentrated underneath the oceanus procellarum and the mare imbrium this is a unique lunar geological province that is now known as the procellarum kreep terrane
basins far from this province that dug deeply into the crust and possibly the mantle such as the mare crisium the mare orientale and the south pole–aitken basin show only little or no enhancements of kreep within their rims or ejecta the enhancement of heat-producing radioactive elements within the crust andor the mantle of the procellarum kreep terrane is almost certainly responsible for the longevity and intensity of mare volcanism on the nearside of the moon
