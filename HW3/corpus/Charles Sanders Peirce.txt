charles sanders peirce  like purse september 10 1839 – april 19 1914 was an american philosopher logician mathematician and scientist who is sometimes known as the father of pragmatism he was educated as a chemist and employed as a scientist for 30 years today he is appreciated largely for his contributions to logic mathematics philosophy scientific methodology and semiotics and for his founding of pragmatism
an innovator in mathematics statistics philosophy research methodology and various sciences peirce considered himself first and foremost a logician he made major contributions to logic but logic for him encompassed much of that which is now called epistemology and philosophy of science he saw logic as the formal branch of semiotics of which he is a founder which foreshadowed the debate among logical positivists and proponents of philosophy of language that dominated 20th century western philosophy additionally he defined the concept of abductive reasoning as well as rigorously formulated mathematical induction and deductive reasoning as early as 1886 he saw that logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits the same idea was used decades later to produce digital computers
in 1934 the philosopher paul weiss called peirce the most original and versatile of american philosophers and americas greatest logician websters biographical dictionary said in 1943 that peirce was now regarded as the most original thinker and greatest logician of his time keith devlin similarly referred to peirce as one of the greatest philosophers ever


 life 

peirce was born at 3 phillips place in cambridge massachusetts he was the son of sarah hunt mills and benjamin peirce himself a professor of astronomy and mathematics at harvard university and perhaps the first serious research mathematician in america at age 12 charles read his older brothers copy of richard whatelys elements of logic then the leading english-language text on the subject so began his lifelong fascination with logic and reasoning he went on to earn the ab and am 1862 from harvard in 1863 the lawrence scientific school awarded him a bsc that was harvards first summa cum laude chemistry degree and otherwise his academic record was undistinguished at harvard he began lifelong friendships with francis ellingwood abbot chauncey wright and william james one of his harvard instructors charles william eliot formed an unfavorable opinion of peirce this opinion proved fateful because eliot while president of harvard 1869–1909—a period encompassing nearly all of peirces working life—repeatedly vetoed harvards employing peirce in any capacity
peirce suffered from his late teens onward from a nervous condition then known as facial neuralgia which would today be diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia his biographer joseph brent says that when in the throes of its pain he was at first almost stupefied and then aloof cold depressed extremely suspicious impatient of the slightest crossing and subject to violent outbursts of temper its consequences may have led to the social isolation which made his lifes later years so tragic


 early employment 
between 1859 and 1891 peirce was intermittently employed in various scientific capacities by the united states coast survey and its successor the united states coast and geodetic survey where he enjoyed his highly influential fathers protection until the latters death in 1880 that employment exempted peirce from having to take part in the american civil war it would have been very awkward for him to do so as the boston brahmin peirces sympathized with the confederacy at the survey he worked mainly in geodesy and gravimetry refining the use of pendulums to determine small local variations in the earths gravity he was elected a resident fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in january 1867 the survey sent him to europe five times first in 1871 as part of a group sent to observe a solar eclipse there he sought out augustus de morgan william stanley jevons and william kingdon clifford british mathematicians and logicians whose turn of mind resembled his own from 1869 to 1872 he was employed as an assistant in harvards astronomical observatory doing important work on determining the brightness of stars and the shape of the milky way on april 20 1877 he was elected a member of the national academy of sciences also in 1877 he proposed measuring the meter as so many wavelengths of light of a certain frequency the kind of definition employed from 1960 to 1983
during the 1880s peirces indifference to bureaucratic detail waxed while his survey works quality and timeliness waned peirce took years to write reports that he should have completed in months meanwhile he wrote entries ultimately thousands during 1883–1909 on philosophy logic science and other subjects for the encyclopedic century dictionary in 1885 an investigation by the allison commission exonerated peirce but led to the dismissal of superintendent julius hilgard and several other coast survey employees for misuse of public funds in 1891 peirce resigned from the coast survey at superintendent thomas corwin mendenhalls request he never again held regular employment


 johns hopkins university 
in 1879 peirce was appointed lecturer in logic at johns hopkins university which had strong departments in a number of areas that interested him such as philosophy royce and dewey completed their phds at hopkins psychology taught by g stanley hall and studied by joseph jastrow who coauthored a landmark empirical study with peirce and mathematics taught by j j sylvester who came to admire peirces work on mathematics and logic his studies in logic by members of the johns hopkins university 1883 contained works by himself and allan marquand christine ladd benjamin ives gilman and oscar howard mitchell several of whom were his graduate students peirces nontenured position at hopkins was the only academic appointment he ever held
brent documents something peirce never suspected namely that his efforts to obtain academic employment grants and scientific respectability were repeatedly frustrated by the covert opposition of a major canadian-american scientist of the day simon newcomb peirces efforts may also have been hampered by what brent characterizes as his difficult personality conversely keith devlin believes that peirces work was too far ahead of his time to be appreciated by the academic establishment of the day and that this played a large role in his inability to obtain a tenured position
peirces personal life undoubtedly worked against his professional success after his first wife harriet melusina fay zina left him in 1875 peirce while still legally married became involved with juliette whose last name given variously as froissy and pourtalai and nationality she spoke french remains uncertain when his divorce from zina became final in 1883 he married juliette that year newcomb pointed out to a johns hopkins trustee that peirce while a hopkins employee had lived and traveled with a woman to whom he was not married the ensuing scandal led to his dismissal in january 1884 over the years peirce sought academic employment at various universities without success he had no children by either marriage


 poverty 
in 1887 peirce spent part of his inheritance from his parents to buy 2,000 acres 8 km2 of rural land near milford pennsylvania which never yielded an economic return there he had an 1854 farmhouse remodeled to his design the peirces named the property arisbe there they lived with few interruptions for the rest of their lives charles writing prolifically much of it unpublished to this day see works living beyond their means soon led to grave financial and legal difficulties he spent much of his last two decades unable to afford heat in winter and subsisting on old bread donated by the local baker unable to afford new stationery he wrote on the verso side of old manuscripts an outstanding warrant for assault and unpaid debts led to his being a fugitive in new york city for a while several people including his brother james mills peirce and his neighbors relatives of gifford pinchot settled his debts and paid his property taxes and mortgage
peirce did some scientific and engineering consulting and wrote much for meager pay mainly encyclopedic dictionary entries and reviews for the nation with whose editor wendell phillips garrison he became friendly he did translations for the smithsonian institution at its director samuel langleys instigation peirce also did substantial mathematical calculations for langleys research on powered flight hoping to make money peirce tried inventing he began but did not complete a number of books in 1888 president grover cleveland appointed him to the assay commission

from 1890 on he had a friend and admirer in judge francis c russell of chicago who introduced peirce to editor paul carus and owner edward c hegeler of the pioneering american philosophy journal the monist which eventually published at least 14 articles by peirce he wrote many texts in james mark baldwins dictionary of philosophy and psychology 1901–5 half of those credited to him appear to have been written actually by christine ladd-franklin under his supervision he applied in 1902 to the newly formed carnegie institution for a grant to write a systematic book of his lifes work the application was doomed his nemesis newcomb served on the institutions executive committee and its president had been the president of johns hopkins at the time of peirces dismissal
the one who did the most to help peirce in these desperate times was his old friend william james dedicating his will to believe 1897 to peirce and arranging for peirce to be paid to give two series of lectures at or near harvard 1898 and 1903 most important each year from 1907 until jamess death in 1910 james wrote to his friends in the boston intelligentsia to request financial aid for peirce the fund continued even after james died peirce reciprocated by designating jamess eldest son as his heir should juliette predecease him it has been believed that this was also why peirce used santiago st james in english as a middle name but he appeared in print as early as 1890 as charles santiago peirce see charles santiago sanders peirce for discussion and references
peirce died destitute in milford pennsylvania twenty years before his widow


 slavery the american civil war and racism 
peirce grew up in a home where the supremacy of the white anglo-saxon male was taken for granted and negro slavery was considered natural
until the outbreak of the civil war his father described himself as a secessionist but after the outbreak of the war this stopped and he became a union partisan providing donations to the sanitary commission the leading northern war charity no members of the peirce family volunteered or enlisted peirce shared his fathers views and liked to use the syllogism to illustrate the unreliability of traditional forms of logic see peirces lawother proofs of peirces law


 reception 
bertrand russell 1959 wrote beyond doubt  he was one of the most original minds of the later nineteenth century and certainly the greatest american thinker ever russell and whiteheads principia mathematica published from 1910 to 1913 does not mention peirce peirces work was not widely known until later a n whitehead while reading some of peirces unpublished manuscripts soon after arriving at harvard in 1924 was struck by how peirce had anticipated his own process thinking on peirce and process metaphysics see lowe 1964 karl popper viewed peirce as one of the greatest philosophers of all times yet peirces achievements were not immediately recognized his imposing contemporaries william james and josiah royce admired him and cassius jackson keyser at columbia and c k ogden wrote about peirce with respect but to no immediate effect
the first scholar to give peirce his considered professional attention was royces student morris raphael cohen the editor of an anthology of peirces writings titled chance love and logic 1923 and the author of the first bibliography of peirces scattered writings john dewey studied under peirce at johns hopkins and from 1916 onward deweys writings repeatedly mention peirce with deference his 1938 logic the theory of inquiry is much influenced by peirce the publication of the first six volumes of collected papers 1931–35 the most important event to date in peirce studies and one that cohen made possible by raising the needed funds did not prompt an outpouring of secondary studies the editors of those volumes charles hartshorne and paul weiss did not become peirce specialists early landmarks of the secondary literature include the monographs by buchler 1939 feibleman 1946 and goudge 1950 the 1941 phd thesis by arthur w burks who went on to edit volumes 7 and 8 and the studies edited by wiener and young 1952 the charles s peirce society was founded in 1946 its transactions an academic quarterly specializing in peirce pragmatism and american philosophy has appeared since 1965 see phillips 2014 62 for discussion of peirce and dewey relative to transactionalism
in 1949 while doing unrelated archival work the historian of mathematics carolyn eisele 1902–2000 chanced on an autograph letter by peirce so began her 40 years of research on peirce the mathematician and scientist culminating in eisele 1976 1979 1985 beginning around 1960 the philosopher and historian of ideas max fisch 1900–1995 emerged as an authority on peirce fisch 1986 includes many of his relevant articles including a wide-ranging survey fisch 1986 422–48 of the impact of peirces thought through 1983
peirce has gained a significant international following marked by university research centers devoted to peirce studies and pragmatism in brazil cenepciep finland hprc and commens germany wirths group hoffmans and ottes group and deusers and härles group france lirsce spain gep and italy csp his writings have been translated into several languages including german french finnish spanish and swedish since 1950 there have been french italian spanish british and brazilian peirceans of note for many years the north american philosophy department most devoted to peirce was the university of torontos thanks in good part to the leadership of thomas goudge and david savan in recent years us peirce scholars have clustered at indiana university - purdue university indianapolis home of the peirce edition project pep and the pennsylvania state university

currently considerable interest is being taken in peirces ideas by researchers wholly outside the arena of academic philosophy the interest comes from industry business technology intelligence organizations and the military and it has resulted in the existence of a substantial number of agencies institutes businesses and laboratories in which ongoing research into and development of peircean concepts are being vigorously undertaken

in recent years peirces trichotomy of signs is exploited by a growing number of practitioners for marketing and design tasks


 works 
peirces reputation rests largely on a number of academic papers published in american scientific and scholarly journals such as proceedings of the american academy of arts and sciences the journal of speculative philosophy the monist popular science monthly the american journal of mathematics memoirs of the national academy of sciences the nation and others see articles by peirce published in his lifetime for an extensive list with links to them online the only full-length book neither extract nor pamphlet that peirce authored and saw published in his lifetime was photometric researches 1878 a 181-page monograph on the applications of spectrographic methods to astronomy while at johns hopkins he edited studies in logic 1883 containing chapters by himself and his graduate students besides lectures during his years 1879–1884 as lecturer in logic at johns hopkins he gave at least nine series of lectures many now published see lectures by peirce
harvard university obtained from peirces widow soon after his death the papers found in his study but did not microfilm them until 1964 only after richard robin 1967 catalogued this nachlass did it become clear that peirce had left approximately 1650 unpublished manuscripts totaling over 100,000 pages mostly still unpublished except on microfilm on the vicissitudes of peirces papers see houser 1989 reportedly the papers remain in unsatisfactory condition
the first published anthology of peirces articles was the one-volume chance love and logic philosophical essays edited by morris raphael cohen 1923 still in print other one-volume anthologies were published in 1940 1957 1958 1972 1994 and 2009 most still in print the main posthumous editions of peirces works in their long trek to light often multi-volume and some still in print have included
1931–58 collected papers of charles sanders peirce cp 8 volumes includes many published works along with a selection of previously unpublished work and a smattering of his correspondence this long-time standard edition drawn from peirces work from the 1860s to 1913 remains the most comprehensive survey of his prolific output from 1893 to 1913 it is organized thematically but texts including lecture series are often split up across volumes while texts from various stages in peirces development are often combined requiring frequent visits to editors notes edited 1–6 by charles hartshorne and paul weiss and 7–8 by arthur burks in print and online

1982–now writings of charles s peirce a chronological edition w volumes 1–6  8 of a projected 30 the limited coverage and defective editing and organization of the collected papers led max fisch and others in the 1970s to found the peirce edition project pep whose mission is to prepare a more complete critical chronological edition only seven volumes have appeared to date but they cover the period from 1859–1892 when peirce carried out much of his best-known work w 8 was published in november 2010 and work continues on w 7 9 and 11 in print and online

 mathematics 

peirces most important work in pure mathematics was in logical and foundational areas he also worked on linear algebra matrices various geometries topology and listing numbers bell numbers graphs the four-color problem and the nature of continuity
he worked on applied mathematics in economics engineering and map projections such as the peirce quincuncial projection and was especially active in probability and statistics
discoveries
peirce made a number of striking discoveries in formal logic and foundational mathematics nearly all of which came to be appreciated only long after he died
in 1860 he suggested a cardinal arithmetic for infinite numbers years before any work by georg cantor who completed his dissertation in 1867 and without access to bernard bolzanos 1851 posthumous paradoxien des unendlichen

in 1880–81 he showed how boolean algebra could be done via a repeated sufficient single binary operation logical nor anticipating henry m sheffer by 33 years see also de morgans laws
in 1881 he set out the axiomatization of natural number arithmetic a few years before richard dedekind and giuseppe peano in the same paper peirce gave years before dedekind the first purely cardinal definition of a finite set in the sense now known as dedekind-finite and implied by the same stroke an important formal definition of an infinite set dedekind-infinite as a set that can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with one of its proper subsets
in 1885 he distinguished between first-order and second-order quantification in the same paper he set out what can be read as the first primitive axiomatic set theory anticipating zermelo by about two decades brady 2000 pp 132–3
in 1886 he saw that boolean calculations could be carried out via electrical switches anticipating claude shannon by more than 50 years

by the later 1890s he was devising existential graphs a diagrammatic notation for the predicate calculus based on them are john f sowas conceptual graphs and sun-joo shins diagrammatic reasoning
the new elements of mathematics
peirce wrote drafts for an introductory textbook with the working title the new elements of mathematics that presented mathematics from an original standpoint those drafts and many other of his previously unpublished mathematical manuscripts finally appeared in the new elements of mathematics by charles s peirce 1976 edited by mathematician carolyn eisele
nature of mathematics
peirce agreed with auguste comte in regarding mathematics as more basic than philosophy and the special sciences of nature and mind peirce classified mathematics into three subareas 1 mathematics of logic 2 discrete series and 3 pseudo-continua as he called them including the real numbers and continua influenced by his father benjamin peirce argued that mathematics studies purely hypothetical objects and is not just the science of quantity but is more broadly the science which draws necessary conclusions that mathematics aids logic not vice versa and that logic itself is part of philosophy and is the science about drawing conclusions necessary and otherwise


 mathematics of logic 

beginning with his first paper on the logic of relatives 1870 peirce extended the theory of relations that augustus de morgan had just recently awakened from its cinderella slumbers much of the mathematics of relations now taken for granted was borrowed from peirce not always with all due credit on that and on how the young bertrand russell especially his principles of mathematics and principia mathematica did not do peirce justice see anellis 1995 in 1918 the logician c i lewis wrote the contributions of cs peirce to symbolic logic are more numerous and varied than those of any other writer—at least in the nineteenth century beginning in 1940 alfred tarski and his students rediscovered aspects of peirces larger vision of relational logic developing the perspective of relation algebra
relational logic gained applications in mathematics it influenced the abstract analysis of e h moore and the lattice theory of garrett birkhoff in computer science the relational model for databases was developed with peircean ideas in work of edgar f codd who was a doctoral student of arthur w burks a peirce scholar in economics relational logic was used by frank p ramsey john von neumann and paul samuelson to study preferences and utility and by kenneth j arrow in social choice and individual values following arrows association with tarski at city college of new york
on peirce and his contemporaries ernst schröder and gottlob frege hilary putnam 1982 documented that freges work on the logic of quantifiers had little influence on his contemporaries although it was published four years before the work of peirce and his student oscar howard mitchell putnam found that mathematicians and logicians learned about the logic of quantifiers through the independent work of peirce and mitchell particularly through peirces on the algebra of logic a contribution to the philosophy of notation 1885 published in the premier american mathematical journal of the day and cited by peano and schröder among others who ignored frege they also adopted and modified peirces notations typographical variants of those now used peirce apparently was ignorant of freges work despite their overlapping achievements in logic philosophy of language and the foundations of mathematics
peirces work on formal logic had admirers besides ernst schröder
philosophical algebraist william kingdon clifford and logician william ernest johnson both british
the polish school of logic and foundational mathematics including alfred tarski
arthur prior who praised and studied peirces logical work in a 1964 paper and in formal logic saying on page 4 that peirce perhaps had a keener eye for essentials than any other logician before or since
a philosophy of logic grounded in his categories and semiotic can be extracted from peirces writings and along with peirces logical work more generally is exposited and defended in hilary putnam 1982 the introduction in nathan houser et al 1997 and randall diperts chapter in cheryl misak 2004


 continua 
continuity and synechism are central in peirces philosophy i did not at first suppose that it was as i gradually came to find it the master-key of philosophy
from a mathematical point of view he embraced infinitesimals and worked long on the mathematics of continua he long held that the real numbers constitute a pseudo-continuum that a true continuum is the real subject matter of analysis situs topology and that a true continuum of instants exceeds—and within any lapse of time has room for—any aleph number any infinite multitude as he called it of instants
in 1908 peirce wrote that he found that a true continuum might have or lack such room jérôme havenel 2008 it is on may 26 1908 that peirce finally gave up his idea that in every continuum there is room for whatever collection of any multitude from now on there are different kinds of continua which have different properties


 probability and statistics 
peirce held that science achieves statistical probabilities not certainties and that spontaneity absolute chance is real see tychism on his view most of his statistical writings promote the frequency interpretation of probability objective ratios of cases and many of his writings express skepticism about and criticize the use of probability when such models are not based on objective randomization though peirce was largely a frequentist his possible world semantics introduced the propensity theory of probability before karl popper peirce sometimes with joseph jastrow investigated the probability judgments of experimental subjects perhaps the very first elicitation and estimation of subjective probabilities in experimental psychology and what came to be called bayesian statistics
peirce was one of the founders of statistics he formulated modern statistics in illustrations of the logic of science 1877–8 and a theory of probable inference 1883 with a repeated measures design charles sanders peirce and joseph jastrow introduced blinded controlled randomized experiments in 1884 hacking 1990205 before ronald a fisher he invented optimal design for experiments on gravity in which he corrected the means he used correlation and smoothing peirce extended the work on outliers by benjamin peirce his father he introduced terms confidence and likelihood before jerzy neyman and fisher see stephen stiglers historical books and ian hacking 1990


 philosophy 

it is not sufficiently recognized that peirces career was that of a scientist not a philosopher and that during his lifetime he was known and valued chiefly as a scientist only secondarily as a logician and scarcely at all as a philosopher even his work in philosophy and logic will not be understood until this fact becomes a standing premise of peircean studies

peirce was a working scientist for 30 years and arguably was a professional philosopher only during the five years he lectured at johns hopkins he learned philosophy mainly by reading each day a few pages of kants critique of pure reason in the original german while a harvard undergraduate his writings bear on a wide array of disciplines including mathematics logic philosophy statistics astronomy metrology geodesy experimental psychology economics linguistics and the history and philosophy of science this work has enjoyed renewed interest and approval a revival inspired not only by his anticipations of recent scientific developments but also by his demonstration of how philosophy can be applied effectively to human problems
peirces philosophy includes see below in related sections a pervasive three-category system belief that truth is immutable and is both independent from actual opinion fallibilism and discoverable no radical skepticism logic as formal semiotic on signs on arguments and on inquirys ways—including philosophical pragmatism which he founded critical common-sensism and scientific method—and in metaphysics scholastic realism eg john duns scotus belief in god freedom and at least an attenuated immortality objective idealism and belief in the reality of continuity and of absolute chance mechanical necessity and creative love in his work fallibilism and pragmatism may seem to work somewhat like skepticism and positivism respectively in others work however for peirce fallibilism is balanced by an anti-skepticism and is a basis for belief in the reality of absolute chance and of continuity and pragmatism commits one to anti-nominalist belief in the reality of the general cp 5.453–7
for peirce first philosophy which he also called cenoscopy is less basic than mathematics and more basic than the special sciences of nature and mind it studies positive phenomena in general phenomena available to any person at any waking moment and does not settle questions by resorting to special experiences he divided such philosophy into 1 phenomenology which he also called phaneroscopy or categorics 2 normative sciences esthetics ethics and logic and 3 metaphysics his views on them are discussed in order below


 theory of categories 

on may 14 1867 the 27-year-old peirce presented a paper entitled on a new list of categories to the american academy of arts and sciences which published it the following year the paper outlined a theory of predication involving three universal categories that peirce developed in response to reading aristotle kant and hegel categories that peirce applied throughout his work for the rest of his life peirce scholars generally regard the new list as foundational or breaking the ground for peirces architectonic his blueprint for a pragmatic philosophy in the categories one will discern concentrated the pattern that one finds formed by the three grades of clearness in how to make our ideas clear 1878 paper foundational to pragmatism and in numerous other trichotomies in his work
on a new list of categories is cast as a kantian deduction it is short but dense and difficult to summarize the following table is compiled from that and later works in 1893 peirce restated most of it for a less advanced audience
 note an interpretant is an interpretation human or otherwise in the sense of the product of an interpretive process


 aesthetics and ethics 
peirce did not write extensively in aesthetics and ethics but came by 1902 to hold that aesthetics ethics and logic in that order comprise the normative sciences he characterized aesthetics as the study of the good grasped as the admirable and thus of the ends governing all conduct and thought


 philosophy logic or semiotic 


 logic as philosophical 
peirce regarded logic per se as a division of philosophy as a normative science based on esthetics and ethics as more basic than metaphysics and as the art of devising methods of research more generally as inference logic is rooted in the social principle since inference depends on a standpoint that in a sense is unlimited peirce called with no sense of deprecation mathematics of logic much of the kind of thing which in current research and applications is called simply logic he was productive in both philosophical logic and logics mathematics which were connected deeply in his work and thought
peirce argued that logic is formal semiotic the formal study of signs in the broadest sense not only signs that are artificial linguistic or symbolic but also signs that are semblances or are indexical such as reactions peirce held that all this universe is perfused with signs if it is not composed exclusively of signs along with their representational and inferential relations he argued that since all thought takes time all thought is in signs and sign processes semiosis such as the inquiry process he divided logic into 1 speculative grammar or stechiology on how signs can be meaningful and in relation to that what kinds of signs there are how they combine and how some embody or incorporate others 2 logical critic or logic proper on the modes of inference and 3 speculative or universal rhetoric or methodeutic the philosophical theory of inquiry including pragmatism


 presuppositions of logic 
in his frl first rule of logic 1899 peirce states that the first and in one sense the sole rule of reason is that to learn one needs to desire to learn and desire it without resting satisfied with that which one is inclined to think so the first rule is to wonder peirce proceeds to a critical theme in research practices and the shaping of theories
there follows one corollary which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy
do not block the way of inquiry
peirce adds that method and economy are best in research but no outright sin inheres in trying any theory in the sense that the investigation via its trial adoption can proceed unimpeded and undiscouraged and that the one unpardonable offence is a philosophical barricade against truths advance an offense to which metaphysicians in all ages have shown themselves the most addicted peirce in many writings holds that logic precedes metaphysics ontological religious and physical
peirce goes on to list four common barriers to inquiry 1 assertion of absolute certainty 2 maintaining that something is absolutely unknowable 3 maintaining that something is absolutely inexplicable because absolutely basic or ultimate 4 holding that perfect exactitude is possible especially such as to quite preclude unusual and anomalous phenomena to refuse absolute theoretical certainty is the heart of fallibilism which peirce unfolds into refusals to set up any of the listed barriers peirce elsewhere argues 1897 that logics presupposition of fallibilism leads at length to the view that chance and continuity are very real tychism and synechism
the first rule of logic pertains to the minds presuppositions in undertaking reason and logic presuppositions for instance that truth and the real do not depend on yours or my opinion of them but do depend on representational relation and consist in the destined end in investigation taken far enough see below he describes such ideas as collectively hopes which in particular cases one is unable seriously to doubt


 four incapacities 

in three articles in 1868–69 peirce rejected mere verbal or hyperbolic doubt and first or ultimate principles and argued that we have as he numbered them
no power of introspection all knowledge of the internal world comes by hypothetical reasoning from known external facts
no power of intuition cognition without logical determination by previous cognitions no cognitive stage is absolutely first in a process all mental action has the form of inference
no power of thinking without signs a cognition must be interpreted in a subsequent cognition in order to be a cognition at all
no conception of the absolutely incognizable
the above sense of the term intuition is almost kants said peirce it differs from the current looser sense that encompasses instinctive or anyway half-conscious inference
peirce argued that those incapacities imply the reality of the general and of the continuous the validity of the modes of reasoning and the falsity of philosophical cartesianism see below
peirce rejected the conception usually ascribed to kant of the unknowable thing-in-itself and later said that to dismiss make-believes is a prerequisite for pragmatism


 logic as formal semiotic 
peirce sought through his wide-ranging studies through the decades formal philosophical ways to articulate thoughts processes and also to explain the workings of science these inextricably entangled questions of a dynamics of inquiry rooted in nature and nurture led him to develop his semiotic with very broadened conceptions of signs and inference and as its culmination a theory of inquiry for the task of saying how science works and devising research methods this would be logic by the medieval definition taught for centuries art of arts science of sciences having the way to the principles of all methods influences radiate from points on parallel lines of inquiry in aristotles work in such loci as the basic terminology of psychology in on the soul the founding description of sign relations in on interpretation and the differentiation of inference into three modes that are commonly translated into english as abduction deduction and induction in the prior analytics as well as inference by analogy called paradeigma by aristotle which peirce regarded as involving the other three modes
peirce began writing on semiotic in the 1860s around the time when he devised his system of three categories he called it both semiotic and semeiotic both are current in singular and plural he based it on the conception of a triadic sign relation and defined semiosis as action or influence which is or involves a cooperation of three subjects such as a sign its object and its interpretant this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs as to signs in thought peirce emphasized the reverse

to say therefore that thought cannot happen in an instant but requires a time is but another way of saying that every thought must be interpreted in another or that all thought is in signs

peirce held that all thought is in signs issuing in and from interpretation where sign is the word for the broadest variety of conceivable semblances diagrams metaphors symptoms signals designations symbols texts even mental concepts and ideas all as determinations of a mind or quasi-mind that which at least functions like a mind as in the work of crystals or bees — the focus is on sign action in general rather than on psychology linguistics or social studies fields which he also pursued
inquiry is a kind of inference process a manner of thinking and semiosis global divisions of ways for phenomena to stand as signs and the subsumption of inquiry and thinking within inference as a sign process enable the study of inquiry on semiotics three levels
conditions for meaningfulness study of significatory elements and combinations their grammar
validity conditions for true representation critique of arguments in their various separate modes
conditions for determining interpretations methodology of inquiry in its mutually interacting modes
peirce uses examples often from common experience but defines and discusses such things as assertion and interpretation in terms of philosophical logic in a formal vein peirce said

on the definition of logic logic is formal semiotic a sign is something a which brings something b its interpretant sign determined or created by it into the same sort of correspondence or a lower implied sort with something c its object as that in which itself stands to c this definition no more involves any reference to human thought than does the definition of a line as the place within which a particle lies during a lapse of time it is from this definition that i deduce the principles of logic by mathematical reasoning and by mathematical reasoning that i aver will support criticism of weierstrassian severity and that is perfectly evident the word formal in the definition is also defined

a list of noted writings by peirce on signs and sign relations is at semiotic theory of charles sanders peirce § references and further reading


 sign relation 
peirces theory of signs is known to be one of the most complex semiotic theories due to its generalistic claim anything is a sign — not absolutely as itself but instead in some relation or other the sign relation is the key it defines three roles encompassing 1 the sign 2 the signs subject matter called its object and 3 the signs meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of effect called its interpretant a further sign for example a translation it is an irreducible triadic relation according to peirce the roles are distinct even when the things that fill those roles are not the roles are but three a sign of an object leads to one or more interpretants and as signs they lead to further interpretants
extension × intension  information two traditional approaches to sign relation necessary though insufficient are the way of extension a signs objects also called breadth denotation or application and the way of intension the objects characteristics qualities attributes referenced by the sign also called depth comprehension significance or connotation peirce adds a third the way of information including change of information to integrate the other two approaches into a unified whole for example because of the equation above if a terms total amount of information stays the same then the more that the term intends or signifies about objects the fewer are the objects to which the term extends or applies
determination a sign depends on its object in such a way as to represent its object — the object enables and in a sense determines the sign a physically causal sense of this stands out when a sign consists in an indicative reaction the interpretant depends likewise on both the sign and the object — an object determines a sign to determine an interpretant but this determination is not a succession of dyadic events like a row of toppling dominoes sign determination is triadic for example an interpretant does not merely represent something which represented an object instead an interpretant represents something as a sign representing the object the object be it a quality or fact or law or even fictional determines the sign to an interpretant through ones collateral experience with the object in which the object is found or from which it is recalled as when a sign consists in a chance semblance of an absent object peirce used the word determine not in a strictly deterministic sense but in a sense of specializes bestimmt involving variable amount like an influence peirce came to define representation and interpretation in terms of triadic determination the object determines the sign to determine another sign — the interpretant — to be related to the object as the sign is related to the object hence the interpretant fulfilling its function as sign of the object determines a further interpretant sign the process is logically structured to perpetuate itself and is definitive of sign object and interpretant in general


 semiotic elements 
peirce held there are exactly three basic elements in semiosis sign action
a sign or representamen represents in the broadest possible sense of represents it is something interpretable as saying something about something it is not necessarily symbolic linguistic or artificial—a cloud might be a sign of rain for instance or ruins the sign of ancient civilization as peirce sometimes put it he defined sign at least 76 times the sign stands for the object to the interpretant a sign represents its object in some respect which respect is the signs ground
an object or semiotic object is a subject matter of a sign and an interpretant it can be anything thinkable a quality an occurrence a rule etc even fictional such as prince hamlet all of those are special or partial objects the object most accurately is the universe of discourse to which the partial or special object belongs for instance a perturbation of plutos orbit is a sign about pluto but ultimately not only about pluto an object either i is immediate to a sign and is the object as represented in the sign or ii is a dynamic object the object as it really is on which the immediate object is founded as on bedrock
an interpretant or interpretant sign is a signs meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of idea or effect an interpretation human or otherwise an interpretant is a sign a of the object and b of the interpretants predecessor the interpreted sign as a sign of the same object an interpretant either i is immediate to a sign and is a kind of quality or possibility such as a words usual meaning or ii is a dynamic interpretant such as a state of agitation or iii is a final or normal interpretant a sum of the lessons which a sufficiently considered sign would have as effects on practice and with which an actual interpretant may at most coincide
some of the understanding needed by the mind depends on familiarity with the object to know what a given sign denotes the mind needs some experience of that signs object experience outside of and collateral to that sign or sign system in that context peirce speaks of collateral experience collateral observation collateral acquaintance all in much the same terms


 classes of signs 
among peirces many sign typologies three stand out interlocked the first typology depends on the sign itself the second on how the sign stands for its denoted object and the third on how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant also each of the three typologies is a three-way division a trichotomy via peirces three phenomenological categories 1 quality of feeling 2 reaction resistance and 3 representation mediation
i qualisign sinsign legisign also called tone token type and also called potisign actisign famisign this typology classifies every sign according to the signs own phenomenological category—the qualisign is a quality a possibility a first the sinsign is a reaction or resistance a singular object an actual event or fact a second and the legisign is a habit a rule a representational relation a third
ii icon index symbol this typology the best known one classifies every sign according to the category of the signs way of denoting its object—the icon also called semblance or likeness by a quality of its own the index by factual connection to its object and the symbol by a habit or rule for its interpretant
iii rheme dicisign argument also called sumisign dicisign suadisign also seme pheme delome and regarded as very broadened versions of the traditional term proposition argument this typology classifies every sign according to the category which the interpretant attributes to the signs way of denoting its object—the rheme for example a term is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of quality the dicisign for example a proposition is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of fact and the argument is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of habit or law this is the culminating typology of the three where the sign is understood as a structural element of inference
every sign belongs to one class or another within i and within ii and within iii thus each of the three typologies is a three-valued parameter for every sign the three parameters are not independent of each other many co-classifications are absent for reasons pertaining to the lack of either habit-taking or singular reaction in a quality and the lack of habit-taking in a singular reaction the result is not 27 but instead ten classes of signs fully specified at this level of analysis


 modes of inference 

borrowing a brace of concepts from aristotle peirce examined three basic modes of inference—abduction deduction and induction—in his critique of arguments or logic proper peirce also called abduction retroduction presumption and earliest of all hypothesis he characterized it as guessing and as inference to an explanatory hypothesis he sometimes expounded the modes of inference by transformations of the categorical syllogism barbara aaa for example in deduction induction and hypothesis 1878 he does this by rearranging the rule barbaras major premise the case barbaras minor premise and the result barbaras conclusion

peirce 1883 in a theory of probable inference studies in logic equated hypothetical inference with the induction of characters of objects as he had done in effect before eventually dissatisfied by 1900 he distinguished them once and for all and also wrote that he now took the syllogistic forms and the doctrine of logical extension and comprehension as being less basic than he had thought in 1903 he presented the following logical form for abductive inference

the surprising fact c is observed
but if a were true c would be a matter of course
hence there is reason to suspect that a is true

the logical form does not also cover induction since induction neither depends on surprise nor proposes a new idea for its conclusion induction seeks facts to test a hypothesis abduction seeks a hypothesis to account for facts deduction proves that something must be induction shows that something actually is operative abduction merely suggests that something may be peirce did not remain quite convinced that one logical form covers all abduction in his methodeutic or theory of inquiry see below he portrayed abduction as an economic initiative to further inference and study and portrayed all three modes as clarified by their coordination in essential roles in inquiry hypothetical explanation deductive prediction inductive testing


 pragmatism 

peirces recipe for pragmatic thinking which he called pragmatism and later pragmaticism is recapitulated in several versions of the so-called pragmatic maxim here is one of his more emphatic reiterations of it

consider what effects that might conceivably have practical bearings you conceive the objects of your conception to have then your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object

as a movement pragmatism began in the early 1870s in discussions among peirce william james and others in the metaphysical club james among others regarded some articles by peirce such as the fixation of belief 1877 and especially how to make our ideas clear 1878 as foundational to pragmatism peirce cp 5.11–12 like james pragmatism a new name for some old ways of thinking 1907 saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes in philosophy and elsewhere elaborated into a new deliberate method for fruitful thinking about problems peirce differed from james and the early john dewey in some of their tangential enthusiasms in being decidedly more rationalistic and realistic in several senses of those terms throughout the preponderance of his own philosophical moods
in 1905 peirce coined the new name pragmaticism for the precise purpose of expressing the original definition saying that all went happily with jamess and fcs schillers variant uses of the old name pragmatism and that he coined the new name because of the old names growing use in literary journals where it gets abused yet he cited as causes in a 1906 manuscript his differences with james and schiller and in a 1908 publication his differences with james as well as literary author giovanni papinis declaration of pragmatisms indefinability peirce in any case regarded his views that truth is immutable and infinity is real as being opposed by the other pragmatists but he remained allied with them on other issues
pragmatism begins with the idea that belief is that on which one is prepared to act peirces pragmatism is a method of clarification of conceptions of objects it equates any conception of an object to a conception of that objects effects to a general extent of the effects conceivable implications for informed practice it is a method of sorting out conceptual confusions occasioned for example by distinctions that make sometimes needed formal yet not practical differences he formulated both pragmatism and statistical principles as aspects of scientific logic in his illustrations of the logic of science series of articles in the second one how to make our ideas clear peirce discussed three grades of clearness of conception
clearness of a conception familiar and readily used even if unanalyzed and undeveloped
clearness of a conception in virtue of clearness of its parts in virtue of which logicians called an idea distinct that is clarified by analysis of just what makes it applicable elsewhere echoing kant peirce called a likewise distinct definition nominal cp 5.553
clearness in virtue of clearness of conceivable practical implications of the objects conceived effects such as fosters fruitful reasoning especially on difficult problems here he introduced that which he later called the pragmatic maxim
by way of example of how to clarify conceptions he addressed conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the presuppositions of reasoning in general in clearnesss second grade the nominal grade he defined truth as a signs correspondence to its object and the real as the object of such correspondence such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or i or any actual definite community of inquirers think after that needful but confined step next in clearnesss third grade the pragmatic practice-oriented grade he defined truth as that opinion which would be reached sooner or later but still inevitably by research taken far enough such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion—a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction peirce argued that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is about that very question under argument a truth with just such independence and discoverability
peirce said that a conceptions meaning consists in all general modes of rational conduct implied by acceptance of the conception—that is if one were to accept first of all the conception as true then what could one conceive to be consequent general modes of rational conduct by all who accept the conception as true—the whole of such consequent general modes is the whole meaning his pragmatism does not equate a conceptions meaning its intellectual purport with the conceived benefit or cost of the conception itself like a meme or say propaganda outside the perspective of its being true nor since a conception is general is its meaning equated with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth his pragmatism also bears no resemblance to vulgar pragmatism which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and machiavellian search for mercenary or political advantage instead the pragmatic maxim is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental reflection arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the formation of explanatory hypotheses and conducive to the use and improvement of verification
peirces pragmatism as method and theory of definitions and conceptual clearness is part of his theory of inquiry which he variously called speculative general formal or universal rhetoric or simply methodeutic he applied his pragmatism as a method throughout his work


 theory of inquiry 


 critical common-sensism 
critical common-sensism treated by peirce as a consequence of his pragmatism is his combination of thomas reids common-sense philosophy with a fallibilism that recognizes that propositions of our more or less vague common sense now indubitable may later come into question for example because of transformations of our world through science it includes efforts to work up in tests genuine doubts for a core group of common indubitables that vary slowly if at all


 rival methods of inquiry 
in the fixation of belief 1877 peirce described inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth per se but as the struggle to move from irritating inhibitory doubt born of surprise disagreement and the like and to reach a secure belief belief being that on which one is prepared to act that let peirce frame scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred like inquiry generally by actual doubt not mere verbal quarrelsome or hyperbolic doubt which he held to be fruitless peirce sketched four methods of settling opinion ordered from least to most successful
the method of tenacity policy of sticking to initial belief — which brings comforts and decisiveness but leads to trying to ignore contrary information and others views as if truth were intrinsically private not public the method goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well notice when anothers opinion seems as good as ones own initial opinion its successes can be brilliant but tend to be transitory
the method of authority — which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally its successes can be majestic and long-lasting but it cannot regulate people thoroughly enough to withstand doubts indefinitely especially when people learn about other societies present and past
the method of the a priori — which promotes conformity less brutally but fosters opinions as something like tastes arising in conversation and comparisons of perspectives in terms of what is agreeable to reason thereby it depends on fashion in paradigms and goes in circles over time it is more intellectual and respectable but like the first two methods sustains accidental and capricious beliefs destining some minds to doubt it
the method of science — wherein inquiry supposes that the real is discoverable but independent of particular opinion such that unlike in the other methods inquiry can by its own account go wrong fallibilism not only right and thus purposely tests itself and criticizes corrects and improves itself
peirce held that in practical affairs slow and stumbling ratiocination is often dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research which in turn should not be trammeled by the other methods and practical ends reasons first rule is that in order to learn one must desire to learn and as a corollary must not block the way of inquiry scientific method excels over the others finally by being deliberately designed to arrive — eventually — at the most secure beliefs upon which the most successful practices can be based starting from the idea that people seek not truth per se but instead to subdue irritating inhibitory doubt peirce showed how through the struggle some can come to submit to truth for the sake of beliefs integrity seek as truth the guidance of potential conduct correctly to its given goal and wed themselves to the scientific method


 scientific method 
insofar as clarification by pragmatic reflection suits explanatory hypotheses and fosters predictions and testing pragmatism points beyond the usual duo of foundational alternatives deduction from self-evident truths or rationalism and induction from experiential phenomena or empiricism
based on his critique of three modes of argument and different from either foundationalism or coherentism peirces approach seeks to justify claims by a three-phase dynamic of inquiry
active abductive genesis of theory with no prior assurance of truth
deductive application of the contingent theory so as to clarify its practical implications
inductive testing and evaluation of the utility of the provisional theory in anticipation of future experience in both senses prediction and control
thereby peirce devised an approach to inquiry far more solid than the flatter image of inductive generalization simpliciter which is a mere re-labeling of phenomenological patterns peirces pragmatism was the first time the scientific method was proposed as an epistemology for philosophical questions
a theory that succeeds better than its rivals in predicting and controlling our world is said to be nearer the truth this is an operational notion of truth used by scientists
peirce extracted the pragmatic model or theory of inquiry from its raw materials in classical logic and refined it in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic to address problems about the nature of scientific reasoning
abduction deduction and induction make incomplete sense in isolation from one another but comprise a cycle understandable as a whole insofar as they collaborate toward the common end of inquiry in the pragmatic way of thinking about conceivable practical implications every thing has a purpose and as possible its purpose should first be denoted abduction hypothesizes an explanation for deduction to clarify into implications to be tested so that induction can evaluate the hypothesis in the struggle to move from troublesome uncertainty to more secure belief no matter how traditional and needful it is to study the modes of inference in abstraction from one another the integrity of inquiry strongly limits the effective modularity of its principal components
peirces outline of the scientific method in §iii–iv of a neglected argument is summarized below except as otherwise noted there he also reviewed plausibility and inductive precision issues of critique of arguments
1 abductive or retroductive phase guessing inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying from abduction peirce distinguishes induction as inferring on the basis of tests the proportion of truth in the hypothesis every inquiry whether into ideas brute facts or norms and laws arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway all explanatory content of theories comes from abduction which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple economical way for a surprising or complicated phenomenon the modicum of success in our guesses far exceeds that of random luck and seems born of attunement to nature by developed or inherent instincts especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense of the facile and natural as by galileos natural light of reason and as distinct from logical simplicity abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference its general rationale is inductive it succeeds often enough and it has no substitute in expediting us toward new truths in 1903 peirce called pragmatism the logic of abduction coordinative method leads from abducting a plausible hypothesis to judging it for its testability and for how its trial would economize inquiry itself the hypothesis being insecure needs to have practical implications leading at least to mental tests and in science lending themselves to scientific tests a simple but unlikely guess if not costly to test for falsity may belong first in line for testing a guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has plausibility or reasoned objective probability while subjective likelihood though reasoned can be misleadingly seductive guesses can be selected for trial strategically for their caution for which peirce gave as example the game of twenty questions breadth or incomplexity one can discover only that which would be revealed through their sufficient experience anyway and so the point is to expedite it economy of research demands the leap so to speak of abduction and governs its art
2 deductive phase two stages
i explication not clearly premised but a deductive analysis of the hypothesis so as to render its parts as clear as possible
ii demonstration deductive argumentation euclidean in procedure explicit deduction of consequences of the hypothesis as predictions about evidence to be found corollarial or if needed theorematic
3 inductive phase evaluation of the hypothesis inferring from observational or experimental tests of its deduced consequences the long-run validity of the rule of induction is deducible from the principle presuppositional to reasoning in general that the real is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead in other words anything excluding such a process would never be real induction involving the ongoing accumulation of evidence follows a method which sufficiently persisted in will diminish the error below any predesignate degree three stages
i classification not clearly premised but an inductive classing of objects of experience under general ideas
ii probation direct inductive argumentation crude or gradual in procedure crude induction founded on experience in one mass cp 2.759 presumes that future experience on a question will not differ utterly from all past experience cp 2.756 gradual induction makes a new estimate of the proportion of truth in the hypothesis after each test and is qualitative or quantitative qualitative gradual induction depends on estimating the relative evident weights of the various qualities of the subject class under investigation cp 2.759 see also cp 7.114–20 quantitative gradual induction depends on how often in a fair sample of instances of s s is found actually accompanied by p that was predicted for s cp 2.758 it depends on measurements or statistics or counting
iii sentential induction which by inductive reasonings appraises the different probations singly then their combinations then makes self-appraisal of these very appraisals themselves and passes final judgment on the whole result


 against cartesianism 
peirce drew on the methodological implications of the four incapacities — no genuine introspection no intuition in the sense of non-inferential cognition no thought but in signs and no conception of the absolutely incognizable — to attack philosophical cartesianism of which he said that
1 it teaches that philosophy must begin in universal doubt — when instead we start with preconceptions prejudices  which it does not occur to us can be questioned though we may find reason to question them later let us not pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our hearts
2 it teaches that the ultimate test of certainty isin the individual consciousness — when instead in science a theory stays on probation till agreement is reached then it has no actual doubters left no lone individual can reasonably hope to fulfill philosophys multi-generational dream when candid and disciplined minds continue to disagree on a theoretical issue even the theorys author should feel doubts about it
3 it trusts to a single thread of inference depending often upon inconspicuous premisses — when instead philosophy should like the successful sciences proceed only from tangible scrutinizable premisses and trust not to any one argument but instead to the multitude and variety of its arguments as forming not a chain at least as weak as its weakest link but a cable whose fibers soever slender are sufficiently numerous and intimately connected
4 it renders many facts absolutely inexplicable unless to say that god makes them so is to be regarded as an explanation — when instead philosophy should avoid being unidealistic misbelieving that something real can defy or evade all possible ideas and supposing inevitably some absolutely inexplicable unanalyzable ultimate which explanatory surmise explains nothing and so is inadmissible


 philosophy metaphysics 

peirce divided metaphysics into 1 ontology or general metaphysics 2 psychical or religious metaphysics and 3 physical metaphysics
ontology peirce was a scholastic realist declaring for the reality of generals as early as 1868 regarding modalities possibility necessity etc he came in later years to regard himself as having wavered earlier as to just how positively real the modalities are in his 1897 the logic of relatives he wrote

i formerly defined the possible as that which in a given state of information real or feigned we do not know not to be true but this definition today seems to me only a twisted phrase which by means of two negatives conceals an anacoluthon we know in advance of experience that certain things are not true because we see they are impossible

peirce retained as useful for some purposes the definitions in terms of information states but insisted that the pragmaticist is committed to a strong modal realism by conceiving of objects in terms of predictive general conditional propositions about how they would behave under certain circumstances
psychical or religious metaphysics peirce believed in god and characterized such belief as founded in an instinct explorable in musing over the worlds of ideas brute facts and evolving habits — and it is a belief in god not as an actual or existent being in peirces sense of those words but all the same as a real being in a neglected argument for the reality of god 1908 peirce sketches for gods reality an argument to a hypothesis of god as the necessary being a hypothesis which he describes in terms of how it would tend to develop and become compelling in musement and inquiry by a normal person who is led by the hypothesis to consider as being purposed the features of the worlds of ideas brute facts and evolving habits for example scientific progress such that the thought of such purposefulness will stand or fall with the hypothesis meanwhile according to peirce the hypothesis in supposing an infinitely incomprehensible being starts off at odds with its own nature as a purportively true conception and so no matter how much the hypothesis grows it both a inevitably regards itself as partly true partly vague and as continuing to define itself without limit and b inevitably has god appearing likewise vague but growing though god as the necessary being is not vague or growing but the hypothesis will hold it to be more false to say the opposite that god is purposeless peirce also argued that the will is free and see synechism that there is at least an attenuated kind of immortality
physical metaphysics peirce held the view which he called objective idealism that matter is effete mind inveterate habits becoming physical laws peirce asserted the reality of 1 absolute chance his tychist view 2 mechanical necessity anancist view and 3 that which he called the law of love agapist view echoing his categories firstness secondness and thirdness respectively he held that fortuitous variation which he also called sporting mechanical necessity and creative love are the three modes of evolution modes called tychasm anancasm and agapasm of the cosmos and its parts he found his conception of agapasm embodied in lamarckian evolution the overall idea in any case is that of evolution tending toward an end or goal and it could also be the evolution of a mind or a society it is the kind of evolution which manifests workings of mind in some general sense he said that overall he was a synechist holding with reality of continuity especially of space time and law


 science of review 

peirce outlined two fields cenoscopy and science of review both of which he called philosophy both included philosophy about science in 1903 he arranged them from more to less theoretically basic thus
science of discovery
mathematics
cenoscopy philosophy as discussed earlier in this article—categorial normative metaphysical as first philosophy concerns positive phenomena in general does not rely on findings from special sciences and includes the general study of inquiry and scientific method
idioscopy or the special sciences of nature and mind

science of review as ultimate philosophy arranges the results of discovery beginning with digests and going on to endeavor to form a philosophy of science his examples included humboldts cosmos comtes philosophie positive and spencers synthetic philosophy
practical science or the arts
peirce placed within science of review the work and theory of classifying the sciences including mathematics and philosophy his classifications on which he worked for many years draw on argument and wide knowledge and are of interest both as a map for navigating his philosophy and as an accomplished polymaths survey of research in his time
