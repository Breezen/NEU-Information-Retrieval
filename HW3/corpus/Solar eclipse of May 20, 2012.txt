an annular solar eclipse took place on may 20 2012 may 21 2012 in local time in the eastern hemisphere one of the three main types of solar eclipses an annular solar eclipse occurs when the moons apparent diameter is smaller than the suns as compared to a total solar eclipse when the moon completely blocks the sun
the eclipse was visible in large areas of the eastern hemisphere and the western hemisphere including the land masses of eastern asia and north america it was the first annular eclipse to pass over the contiguous united states since the solar eclipse of may 10 1994 which occurred 18 years prior to this event it was the first over asia since the solar eclipse of january 15 2010


 path and viewing 

the antumbra stretched 236 kilometres 147 mi wide and travelled eastbound at an average rate of 1.00 kilometre 0.62 mi per minute remaining above the equator throughout the event the longest duration of annularity was 5 minutes and 43 seconds occurring just south of the aleutian islands the greatest extent or width of the eclipse occurred about 3 minutes after the greatest duration with 89% of the sun being covered by the moon the eclipse is notable for beginning on a monday and ending on the previous sunday as it crossed the international date line

the path of the antumbra over highly populated areas allowed at least an estimated 100 million people to view annularity because it took place during the summer monsoon season in southeast asia viewing conditions were not ideal in some areas including hong kong
