in geometrical optics a focus also called an image point is the point where light rays originating from a point on the object converge although the focus is conceptually a point physically the focus has a spatial extent called the blur circle this non-ideal focusing may be caused by aberrations of the imaging optics in the absence of significant aberrations the smallest possible blur circle is the airy disc which is caused by diffraction from the optical systems aperture aberrations tend to get worse as the aperture diameter increases while the airy circle is smallest for large apertures
an image or image point or region is in focus if light from object points is converged almost as much as possible in the image and out of focus if light is not well converged the border between these is sometimes defined using a circle of confusion criterion
a principal focus or focal point is a special focus
for a lens or a spherical or parabolic mirror it is a point onto which collimated light parallel to the axis is focused since light can pass through a lens in either direction a lens has two focal pointsâ€”one on each side the distance in air from the lens or mirrors principal plane to the focus is called the focal length
elliptical mirrors have two focal points light that passes through one of these before striking the mirror is reflected such that it passes through the other
the focus of a hyperbolic mirror is either of two points which have the property that light from one is reflected as if it came from the other
diverging negative lenses and convex mirrors do not focus a collimated beam to a point instead the focus is the point from which the light appears to be emanating after it travels through the lens or reflects from the mirror a convex parabolic mirror will reflect a beam of collimated light to make it appear as if it were radiating from the focal point or conversely reflect rays directed toward the focus as a collimated beam a convex elliptical mirror will reflect light directed towards one focus as if it were radiating from the other focus both of which are behind the mirror a convex hyperbolic mirror will reflect rays emanating from the focal point in front of the mirror as if they were emanating from the focal point behind the mirror conversely it can focus rays directed at the focal point that is behind the mirror towards the focal point that is in front of the mirror as in a cassegrain telescope
