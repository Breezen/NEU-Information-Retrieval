a total solar eclipse occurred on july 11 1991 a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between earth and the sun thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the sun for a viewer on earth a total solar eclipse occurs when the moons apparent diameter is larger than the suns blocking all direct sunlight turning day into darkness totality occurs in a narrow path across earths surface with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide totality began over the pacific ocean and hawaii moving across mexico down through central america and across south america ending over brazil it lasted for 6 minutes and 53 seconds at the point of maximum eclipse there will not be a longer total eclipse until june 13 2132
this eclipse was the most central total eclipse in 800 years with a gamma of -.0041 there will not be a more central eclipse for another 800 years its magnitude was also greater than any eclipse since the 6th century

 solar eclipses 1990-1992 
each member in a semester series of solar eclipses repeats approximately every 177 days and 4 hours a semester at alternating nodes of the moons orbit


 saros 136 
solar saros 136 repeating every 18 years 11 days contains 71 events the series started with partial solar eclipse on june 14 1360 and reached a first annular eclipse on september 8 1504 it was a hybrid event from november 22 1612 through january 17 1703 and total eclipses from january 27 1721 through may 13 2496 the series ends at member 71 as a partial eclipse on july 30 2622 with the entire series lasting 1262 years the longest eclipse occurred on june 20 1955 with a maximum duration of totality at 7 minutes 8 seconds


 inex series 
this eclipse is a part of the long period inex cycle repeating at alternating nodes every 358 synodic months ≈ 10,571.95 days or 29 years minus 20 days their appearance and longitude are irregular due to a lack of synchronization with the anomalistic month period of perigee however groupings of 3 inex cycles ≈ 87 years minus 2 months comes close ≈ 1,151.02 anomalistic months so eclipses are similar in these groupings


 tritos series 
this eclipse is a part of a tritos cycle repeating at alternating nodes every 135 synodic months ≈ 3986.63 days or 11 years minus 1 month their appearance and longitude are irregular due to a lack of synchronization with the anomalistic month period of perigee but groupings of 3 tritos cycles ≈ 33 years minus 3 months come close ≈ 434.044 anomalistic months so eclipses are similar in these groupings


 metonic series 
the metonic series repeats eclipses every 19 years 6939.69 days lasting about 5 cycles eclipses occur in nearly the same calendar date in addition the octon subseries repeats 1/5 of that or every 3.8 years 1387.94 days
