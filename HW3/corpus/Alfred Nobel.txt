alfred bernhard nobel  swedish ˈalfrɛd nʊˈbɛl  listen  21 october 1833 – 10 december 1896 was a swedish chemist engineer inventor businessman and philanthropist
known for inventing dynamite nobel also owned bofors which he had redirected from its previous role as primarily an iron and steel producer to a major manufacturer of cannon and other armaments nobel held 355 different patents dynamite being the most famous after reading a premature obituary which condemned him for profiting from the sales of arms he bequeathed his fortune to institute the nobel prizes the synthetic element nobelium was named after him his name also survives in modern-day companies such as dynamit nobel and akzonobel which are descendants of mergers with companies nobel himself established


 life and career 

born in stockholm alfred nobel was the third son of immanuel nobel 1801–1872 an inventor and engineer and carolina andriette ahlsell nobel 1805–1889 the couple married in 1827 and had eight children the family was impoverished and only alfred and his three brothers survived past childhood through his father alfred nobel was a descendant of the swedish scientist olaus rudbeck 1630–1702 and in his turn the boy was interested in engineering particularly explosives learning the basic principles from his father at a young age alfred nobels interest in technology was inherited from his father an alumnus of royal institute of technology in stockholm
following various business failures nobels father moved to saint petersburg in 1837 and grew successful there as a manufacturer of machine tools and explosives he invented modern plywood and started work on the torpedo in 1842 the family joined him in the city now prosperous his parents were able to send nobel to private tutors and the boy excelled in his studies particularly in chemistry and languages achieving fluency in english french german and russian for 18 months from 1841 to 1842 nobel went to the only school he ever attended as a child the jacobs apologistic school in stockholm
as a young man nobel studied with chemist nikolai zinin then in 1850 went to paris to further the work there he met ascanio sobrero who had invented nitroglycerin three years before sobrero strongly opposed the use of nitroglycerin as it was unpredictable exploding when subjected to heat or pressure but nobel became interested in finding a way to control and use nitroglycerin as a commercially usable explosive as it had much more power than gunpowder at age 18 he went to the united states for one year to study chemistry working for a short period under inventor john ericsson who designed the american civil war ironclad uss monitor nobel filed his first patent an english patent for a gas meter in 1857 while his first swedish patent which he received in 1863 was on ways to prepare gunpowder
the family factory produced armaments for the crimean war 1853–1856 but had difficulty switching back to regular domestic production when the fighting ended and they filed for bankruptcy in 1859 nobels father left his factory in the care of the second son ludvig nobel 1831–1888 who greatly improved the business nobel and his parents returned to sweden from russia and nobel devoted himself to the study of explosives and especially to the safe manufacture and use of nitroglycerin nobel invented a detonator in 1863 and in 1865 designed the blasting cap
on 3 september 1864 a shed used for preparation of nitroglycerin exploded at the factory in heleneborg stockholm killing five people including nobels younger brother emil dogged and unfazed by more minor accidents nobel went on to build further factories focusing on improving the stability of the explosives he was developing nobel invented dynamite in 1867 a substance easier and safer to handle than the more unstable nitroglycerin dynamite was patented in the us and the uk and was used extensively in mining and the building of transport networks internationally in 1875 nobel invented gelignite more stable and powerful than dynamite and in 1887 patented ballistite a predecessor of cordite
nobel was elected a member of the royal swedish academy of sciences in 1884 the same institution that would later select laureates for two of the nobel prizes and he received an honorary doctorate from uppsala university in 1893

nobels brothers ludvig and robert exploited oilfields along the caspian sea and became hugely rich in their own right nobel invested in these and amassed great wealth through the development of these new oil regions during his life nobel was issued 355 patents internationally and by his death his business had established more than 90 armaments factories despite his belief in pacifism
in 1888 the death of his brother ludvig caused several newspapers to publish obituaries of alfred in error one french newspaper published an obituary titled le marchand de la mort est mort the merchant of death is dead nobel read the obituary and was appalled at the idea that he would be remembered in this way his decision to posthumously donate the majority of his wealth to found the nobel prize has been credited at least in part to him wanting to leave a behind a better legacy


 death 
accused of “high treason against france” for selling ballistite to italy nobel moved from paris to sanremo italy in 1891 on december 10 1896 alfred nobel succumbed to a lingering heart ailment suffered a stroke and died unbeknownst to his family friends or colleagues he had left most of his wealth in trust in order to fund the awards that would become known as the nobel prizes he is buried in norra begravningsplatsen in stockholm


 personal life 
through baptism and confirmation alfred nobel was lutheran and during his paris years he regularly attended the church of sweden abroad led by pastor nathan söderblom who would in 1930 also be the recipient of the nobel peace prize however he became an agnostic at youth and was an atheist later in life
nobel travelled for much of his business life maintaining companies in various countries in europe and north america and keeping a permanent home in paris from 1873 to 1891 he remained a solitary character given to periods of depression  though nobel remained unmarried his biographers note that he had at least three loves nobels first love was in russia with a girl named alexandra who rejected his proposal in 1876 austro-bohemian countess bertha kinsky became alfred nobels secretary but after only a brief stay she left him to marry her previous lover baron arthur gundaccar von suttner though her personal contact with alfred nobel had been brief she corresponded with him until his death in 1896 and it is believed that she was a major influence in his decision to include a peace prize among those prizes provided in his will bertha von suttner was awarded the 1905 nobel peace prize for her sincere peace activities
nobels third and longest-lasting relationship was with sofie hess from vienna whom he met in 1876 the liaison lasted for 18 years after his death according to his biographers evlanoff fluor and fant nobels letters were locked within the nobel institute in stockholm they were released only in 1955 to be included with other biographical data
despite the lack of formal secondary and tertiary level education nobel gained proficiency in six languages swedish french russian english german and italian he also developed sufficient literary skill to write poetry in english his nemesis a prose tragedy in four acts about beatrice cenci partly inspired by percy bysshe shelleys the cenci was printed while he was dying the entire stock except for three copies was destroyed immediately after his death being regarded as scandalous and blasphemous the first surviving edition bilingual swedish–esperanto was published in sweden in 2003 the play has been translated into slovenian via the esperanto version and into french in 2010 it was published in russia in another bilingual russian–esperanto edition


 inventions 

nobel found that when nitroglycerin was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like kieselguhr diatomaceous earth it became safer and more convenient to handle and this mixture he patented in 1867 as dynamite nobel demonstrated his explosive for the first time that year at a quarry in redhill surrey england in order to help reestablish his name and improve the image of his business from the earlier controversies associated with the dangerous explosives nobel had also considered naming the highly powerful substance nobels safety powder but settled with dynamite instead referring to the greek word for power δύναμισ
nobel later combined nitroglycerin with various nitrocellulose compounds similar to collodion but settled on a more efficient recipe combining another nitrate explosive and obtained a transparent jelly-like substance which was a more powerful explosive than dynamite gelignite or blasting gelatin as it was named was patented in 1876 and was followed by a host of similar combinations modified by the addition of potassium nitrate and various other substances gelignite was more stable transportable and conveniently formed to fit into bored holes like those used in drilling and mining than the previously used compounds and was adopted as the standard technology for mining in the age of engineering bringing nobel a great amount of financial success though at a significant cost to his health an offshoot of this research resulted in nobels invention of ballistite the precursor of many modern smokeless powder explosives and still used as a rocket propellant


 nobel prizes 

in 1888 alfreds brother ludvig died while visiting cannes and a french newspaper erroneously published alfreds obituary it condemned him for his invention of dynamite and is said to have brought about his decision to leave a better legacy after his death the obituary stated le marchand de la mort est mort the merchant of death is dead and went on to say dr alfred nobel who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before died yesterday alfred who never had a wife or children was disappointed with what he read and concerned with how he would be remembered
on 27 november 1895 at the swedish-norwegian club in paris nobel signed his last will and testament and set aside the bulk of his estate to establish the nobel prizes to be awarded annually without distinction of nationality after taxes and bequests to individuals nobels will allocated 94% of his total assets 31,225,000 swedish kronor to establish the five nobel prizes this converted to £1,687,837 gbp at the time in 2012 the capital was worth around sek 3.1 billion usd 472 million eur 337 million which is almost twice the amount of the initial capital taking inflation into account
the first three of these prizes are awarded for eminence in physical science in chemistry and in medical science or physiology the fourth is for literary work in an ideal direction and the fifth prize is to be given to the person or society that renders the greatest service to the cause of international fraternity in the suppression or reduction of standing armies or in the establishment or furtherance of peace congresses
the formulation for the literary prize being given for a work in an ideal direction i idealisk riktning in swedish is cryptic and has caused much confusion for many years the swedish academy interpreted ideal as idealistic idealistisk and used it as a reason not to give the prize to important but less romantic authors such as henrik ibsen and leo tolstoy this interpretation has since been revised and the prize has been awarded to for example dario fo and josé saramago who do not belong to the camp of literary idealism
there was room for interpretation by the bodies he had named for deciding on the physical sciences and chemistry prizes given that he had not consulted them before making the will in his one-page testament he stipulated that the money go to discoveries or inventions in the physical sciences and to discoveries or improvements in chemistry he had opened the door to technological awards but had not left instructions on how to deal with the distinction between science and technology since the deciding bodies he had chosen were more concerned with the former the prizes went to scientists more often than engineers technicians or other inventors
in 2001 alfred nobels great-great-nephew peter nobel b 1931 asked the bank of sweden to differentiate its award to economists given in alfred nobels memory from the five other awards this request added to the controversy over whether the bank of sweden prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel is actually a legitimate nobel prize
