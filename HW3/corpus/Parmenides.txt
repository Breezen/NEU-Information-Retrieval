parmenides of elea  greek παρμενίδησ ὁ ἐλεάτησ fl late sixth or early fifth century bc was a pre-socratic greek philosopher from elea in magna graecia greater greece included southern italy he was the founder of the eleatic school of philosophy the single known work of parmenides is a poem on nature which has survived only in fragmentary form in this poem parmenides describes two views of reality in the way of truth a part of the poem he explains how reality coined as what-is is one change is impossible and existence is timeless uniform necessary and unchanging in the way of opinion he explains the world of appearances in which ones sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful he has been considered to be the founder of metaphysics or ontology


 early life 
parmenides was born in the greek colony of elea now ascea which according to herodotus had been founded shortly before 535 bc he was descended from a wealthy and illustrious family
his dates are uncertain according to diogenes laërtius he flourished just before 500 bc which would put his year of birth near 540 bc but plato has him visiting athens at the age of 65 when socrates was a young man c 450 bc which if true suggests a year of birth of c 515 bc he was said to have been a pupil of xenophanes and regardless of whether they actually knew each other xenophanes philosophy is the most obvious influence on parmenides diogenes laërtius also describes parmenides as a disciple of ameinias son of diochaites the pythagorean but there are no obvious pythagorean elements in his thought
however according to sir william smith in dictionary of greek and roman biography and mythology 1870

others content themselves with reckoning parmenides as well as zeno as belonging to the pythagorean school or with speaking of a parmenidean life in the same way as a pythagorean life is spoken of and even the censorious timon allows parmenides to have been a high-minded man while plato speaks of him with veneration and aristotle and others give him an unqualified preference over the rest of the eleatics


 career 
the first hero cult of a philosopher we know of was parmenides dedication of a heroon to his teacher ameinias in elea parmenides was the founder of the school of elea which also included zeno of elea and melissus of samos of his life in elea it was said that he had written the laws of the city his most important pupil was zeno who according to plato was 25 years his junior and was regarded as his eromenos parmenides had a large influence on plato who not only named a dialogue parmenides after him but always wrote about him with veneration


 thought 
william smith also wrote in dictionary of greek and roman biography and mythology

on the former reason is our guide on the latter the eye that does not catch the object and re-echoing hearing on the former path we convince ourselves that the existent neither has come into being nor is perishable and is entirely of one sort without change and limit neither past nor future entirely included in the present for it is as impossible that it can become and grow out of the existent as that it could do so out of the non-existent since the latter non-existence is absolutely inconceivable and the former cannot precede itself and every coming into existence presupposes a non-existence by similar arguments divisibility motion or change as also infinity are shut out from the absolutely existent and the latter is represented as shut up in itself so that it may be compared to a well-rounded ball while thought is appropriated to it as its only positive definition thought and that which is thought of object coinciding the corresponding passages of plato aristotle theophrastus and others which authenticate this view of his theory


 parmenides cosmology 

cosmology originally comprised the greater part of his poem him explaining the world’s origins and operations john palmer notes parmenides’ distinction among the principal modes of being and his derivation of the attributes that must belong to what must be simply as such qualify him to be seen as the founder of metaphysics or ontology as a domain of inquiry distinct from theology some idea of the sphericity of the earth seems to have been known to both parmenides and empedocles
parmenides also outlined the phases of the moon highlighted in a rhymed translation by karl popper

smith stated

of the cosmogony of parmenides which was carried out very much in detail we possess only a few fragments and notices which are difficult to understand according to which with an approach to the doctrines of the pythagoreans he conceived the spherical mundane system surrounded by a circle of the pure light olympus uranus in the centre of this mundane system the solid earth and between the two the circle of the milkyway of the morning or evening star of the sun the planets and the moon which circle he regarded as a mixture of the two primordial elements

the fragments read

you will know the aether’s nature and in the aether all the signs and the unseen works of the pure torch of the brilliant sun and from whence they came to be and you will learn the wandering works of the round-eyed moon and its nature and you will know too the surrounding heaven both whence it grew and how necessity directing it bound it to furnish the limits of the stars fr 10
…how the earth and sun and moon and the shared aether and the heavenly milk and olympos outermost and the hot might of the stars began to come to be fr 11


 on nature 
parmenides is one of the most significant of the pre-socratic philosophers his single known work a poem conventionally titled on nature has survived only in fragments approximately 160 verses remain today from an original total that was probably near 800 the poem was originally divided into three parts
a proem greek προοίμιον which introduced the entire work
a section known as the way of truth aletheia ἀλήθεια and
a section known as the way of appearanceopinion doxa δόξα
the proem is a narrative sequence in which the narrator travels beyond the beaten paths of mortal men to receive a revelation from an unnamed goddess generally thought to be persephone or dikē on the nature of reality aletheia an estimated 90% of which has survived and doxa most of which no longer exists are then presented as the spoken revelation of the goddess without any accompanying narrative
parmenides attempted to distinguish between the unity of nature and its variety insisting in the way of truth upon the reality of its unity which is therefore the object of knowledge and upon the unreality of its variety which is therefore the object not of knowledge but of opinion in the way of opinion he propounded a theory of the world of seeming and its development pointing out however that in accordance with the principles already laid down these cosmological speculations do not pretend to anything more than mere appearance


 proem 
in the proem parmenides describes the journey of the poet escorted by maidens the daughters of the sun made haste to escort me having left the halls of night for the light from the ordinary daytime world to a strange destination outside our human paths carried in a whirling chariot and attended by the daughters of helios the sun the man reaches a temple sacred to an unnamed goddess variously identified by the commentators as nature wisdom necessity or themis by whom the rest of the poem is spoken the goddess resides in a well-known mythological space where night and day have their meeting place its essential character is that here all opposites are undivided or one he must learn all things she tells him – both truth which is certain and human opinions which are uncertain – for though one cannot rely on human opinions they represent an aspect of the whole truth


 the way of truth 

the section known as the way of truth discusses that which is real and contrasts with the argument in the section called the way of opinion which discusses that which is illusory under the way of truth parmenides stated that there are two ways of inquiry that it is on the one side and that it is not on the other side he said that the latter argument is never feasible because there is no thing that can not be for never shall this prevail that things that are not are b 7.1
there are extremely delicate issues here in the original greek the two ways are simply named that is ὅπωσ ἐστίν and that not-is ὡσ οὐκ ἐστίν b 2.3 and 2.5 without the it inserted in our english translation in ancient greek which like many languages in the world does not always require the presence of a subject for a verb is functions as a grammatically complete sentence much debate has been focused on where and what the subject is the simplest explanation as to why there is no subject here is that parmenides wishes to express the simple bare fact of existence in his mystical experience without the ordinary distinctions just as the latin pluit and the greek huei ὕει rains mean it rains there is no subject for these impersonal verbs because they express the simple fact of raining without specifying what is doing the raining this is for instance hermann fränkels thesis many scholars still reject this explanation and have produced more complex metaphysical explanations since existence is an immediately intuited fact non-existence is the wrong path because a thing cannot disappear just as something cannot originate from nothing in such mystical experience unio mystica however the distinction between subject and object disappears along with the distinctions between objects in addition to the fact that if nothing cannot be it cannot be the object of thought either

thinking and the thought that it is are the same for you will not find thinking apart from what is in relation to which it is uttered b 8.34–36

for to be aware and to be are the same b 3

it is necessary to speak and to think what is for being is but nothing is not b 6.1–2

helplessness guides the wandering thought in their breasts they are carried along deaf and blind alike dazed beasts without judgment convinced that to be and not to be are the same and not the same and that the road of all things is a backward-turning one b 6.5–9

thus he concluded that is could not have come into being because nothing comes from nothing existence is necessarily eternal that which truly is x has always been x and was never becoming x that which is becoming x was never nothing not-x but will never actually be parmenides was not struggling to formulate the laws of conservation of mass and conservation of energy he was struggling with the metaphysics of change which is still a relevant philosophical topic today moreover he argued that movement was impossible because it requires moving into the void and parmenides identified the void with nothing and therefore by definition it does not exist that which does exist is the parmenidean one which is timeless uniform and unchanging

how could what is perish how could it have come to be for if it came into being it is not nor is it if ever it is going to be thus coming into being is extinguished and destruction unknown b 8.20–22

nor was it once nor will it be since it is now all together  one continuous for what coming-to-be of it will you seek  in what way whence did it grow neither from what-is-not shall i allow  you to say or think for it is not to be said or thought  that it is not and what need could have impelled it to grow  later or sooner if it began from nothing thus it must either be completely or not at all b 8.5–11

what exists is now all at once one and continuous nor is it divisible since it is all alike nor is there any more or less of it in one place which might prevent it from holding together but all is full of what is b 8.5–6 8.22–24

and it is all one to me  where i am to begin for i shall return there again b 5


 perception vs logos 
parmenides claimed that there is no truth in the opinions of the mortals genesis-and-destruction as parmenides emphasizes is a false opinion because to be means to be completely once and for all what exists can in no way not exist

for this view that that which is not exists can never predominate you must debar your thought from this way of search nor let ordinary experience in its variety force you along this way namely that of allowing the eye sightless as it is and the ear full of sound and the tongue to rule but you must judge by means of the reason logos the much-contested proof which is expounded by me b 7.1–8.2


 the way of opinion doxa 
after the exposition of the arche ἀρχή ie the origin the necessary part of reality that is understood through reason or logos that it is in the next section the way of appearanceopinionseeming parmenides proceeds to explain the structure of the becoming cosmos which is an illusion of course that comes from this origin
the structure of the cosmos is a fundamental binary principle that governs the manifestations of all the particulars the aether fire of flame b 8.56 which is gentle mild soft thin and clear and self-identical and the other is ignorant night body thick and heavy

the mortals lay down and decided well to name two forms ie the flaming light and obscure darkness of night out of which it is necessary not to make one and in this they are led astray b 8.53–4

the structure of the cosmos then generated is recollected by aetius ii 7 1

for parmenides says that there are circular bands wound round one upon the other one made of the rare the other of the dense and others between these mixed of light and darkness what surrounds them all is solid like a wall beneath it is a fiery band and what is in the very middle of them all is solid around which again is a fiery band the most central of the mixed bands is for them all the origin and cause of motion and becoming which he also calls steering goddess and keyholder and justice and necessity the air has been separated off from the earth vapourized by its more violent condensation and the sun and the circle of the milky way are exhalations of fire the moon is a mixture of both earth and fire the aether lies around above all else and beneath it is ranged that fiery part which we call heaven beneath which are the regions around the earth


 interpretations of parmenides 
the traditional interpretation of parmenides work is that he argued that the every-day perception of reality of the physical world as described in doxa is mistaken and that the reality of the world is one being as described in aletheia an unchanging ungenerated indestructible whole under the way of opinion parmenides set out a contrasting but more conventional view of the world thereby becoming an early exponent of the duality of appearance and reality for him and his pupils the phenomena of movement and change are simply appearances of a changeless eternal reality this interpretation could settle because of various wrong translations of the fragments for example it is not at all clear that parmenides refuted that which we call perception the verb noein used frequently by parmenides could better be translated as to be aware of than as to think furthermore it is hard to believe that being is only within our heads according to parmenides
parmenides philosophy is presented in the form of poetry the philosophy he argued was he says given to him by a goddess though the mythological details in parmenides poem do not bear any close correspondence to anything known from traditional greek mythology

welcome youth who come attended by immortal charioteers and mares which bear you on your journey to our dwelling for it is no evil fate that has set you to travel on this road far from the beaten paths of men but right and justice it is meet that you learn all things — both the unshakable heart of well-rounded truth and the opinions of mortals in which there is not true belief b 1.24–30

it is with respect to this religiousmystical context that recent generations of scholars such as alexander p mourelatos charles h kahn and the controversial peter kingsley have begun to call parts of the traditional rational logicalphilosophical interpretation of parmenides into question kingsley in particular stating that parmenides practiced iatromancy it has been claimed that previous scholars placed too little emphasis on the apocalyptic context in which parmenides frames his revelation as a result traditional interpretations have put parmenidean philosophy into a more modern metaphysical context to which it is not necessarily well suited which has led to misunderstanding of the true meaning and intention of parmenides message the obscurity and fragmentary state of the text however renders almost every claim that can be made about parmenides extremely contentious and the traditional interpretation has by no means been abandoned
parmenides considerable influence on the thinking of plato is undeniable and in this respect parmenides has influenced the whole history of western philosophy and is often seen as its grandfather even plato himself in the sophist refers to the work of our father parmenides as something to be taken very seriously and treated with respect in the parmenides the eleatic philosopher which may well be parmenides himself and socrates argue about dialectic in the theaetetus socrates says that parmenides alone among the wise protagoras heraclitus empedocles epicharmus and homer denied that everything is change and motion
parmenides is credited with a great deal of influence as the author of an eleatic challenge that determined the course of subsequent philosophers enquiries for example the ideas of empedocles anaxagoras leucippus and democritus have been seen as in response to parmenides arguments and conclusions
parmenides influence on philosophy reaches up till present times the italian philosopher emanuele severino has founded his extended philosophical investigations on the words of parmenides his philosophy is sometimes called neo parmenideism and can be understood as an attempt to build a bridge between the poem on truth and the poem on opinion


 influence on the development of science 
parmenides made the ontological argument against nothingness essentially denying the possible existence of a void according to aristotle this led democritus and leucippus and many other physicists to propose the atomic theory which supposes that everything in the universe is either atoms or voids specifically to contradict parmenides argument aristotle himself reasoned in opposition to atomism that in a complete vacuum motion would encounter no resistance and no one could say why a thing once set in motion should stop anywhere for why should it stop here rather than here so that a thing will either be at rest or must be moved ad infinitum unless something more powerful get in its way see also horror vacui
erwin schrödinger identified parmenides monad of the way of truth as being the conscious self in nature and the greeks the scientific implications of this view have been discussed by scientist anthony hyman
a shadow of parmenides ideas can be seen in the physical concept of block time which considers existence to consist of past present and future and the flow of time to be illusory in his critique of this idea karl popper called einstein parmenides however popper did write

so what was really new in parmenides was his axiomatic-deductive method which leucippus and democritus turned into a hypothetical-deductive method and thus made part of scientific methodology
