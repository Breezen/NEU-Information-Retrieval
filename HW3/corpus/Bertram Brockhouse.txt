bertram neville brockhouse  july 15 1918 â€“ october 13 2003 was a canadian physicist he was awarded the nobel prize in physics 1994 shared with clifford shull for pioneering contributions to the development of neutron scattering techniques for studies of condensed matter in particular for the development of neutron spectroscopy


 education and early life 
brockhouse was born in lethbridge alberta and was a graduate of the university of british columbia ba 1947 and the university of toronto ma 1948 phd 1950


 career and research 
from 1950 to 1962 brockhouse carried out research at atomic energy of canadas chalk river nuclear laboratory here he was joined by p k iyengar who is treated as the father of indias nuclear program
in 1962 he became professor at mcmaster university in canada where he remained until his retirement in 1984
