 biography 


 background and early life 

beethoven was the grandson of ludwig van beethoven 1712–73 a musician from the town of mechelen in the duchy of brabant in the flemish region of what is now belgium who at the age of 21 moved to bonn ludwig he adopted the german cognate of the dutch lodewijk was employed as a bass singer at the court of the elector of cologne eventually rising to become in 1761 kapellmeister music director and thereafter the pre-eminent musician in bonn the portrait he commissioned of himself towards the end of his life remained proudly displayed in his grandsons rooms as a talisman of his musical heritage ludwig had one son johann 1740–1792 who worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and violin lessons to supplement his income johann married maria magdalena keverich in 1767 she was the daughter of johann heinrich keverich 1701–1751 who had been the head chef at the court of the archbishopric of trier

beethoven was born of this marriage in bonn there is no authentic record of the date of his birth however the registry of his baptism in a catholic service at the parish of st regius on 17 december 1770 survives as children of that era were traditionally baptised the day after birth in the catholic rhine country and it is known that beethovens family and his teacher johann albrechtsberger celebrated his birthday on 16 december most scholars accept 16 december 1770 as his date of birth of the seven children born to johann van beethoven only ludwig the second-born and two younger brothers survived infancy kaspar anton karl was born on 8 april 1774 and nikolaus johann the youngest was born on 2 october 1776
beethovens first music teacher was his father he later had other local teachers the court organist gilles van den eeden d 1782 tobias friedrich pfeiffer a family friend who provided keyboard tuition and franz rovantini a relative who instructed him in playing the violin and viola from the outset his tuition regime which began in his fifth year was harsh and intensive often reducing him to tears with the involvement of the insomniac pfeiffer there were irregular late-night sessions with the young beethoven being dragged from his bed to the keyboard his musical talent was obvious at a young age johann aware of leopold mozarts successes in this area with his son wolfgang and daughter nannerl attempted to promote his son as a child prodigy claiming that beethoven was six he was seven on the posters for his first public performance in march 1778
some time after 1779 beethoven began his studies with his most important teacher in bonn christian gottlob neefe who was appointed the courts organist in that year neefe taught him composition and by march 1783 had helped him write his first published composition a set of keyboard variations woo 63 beethoven soon began working with neefe as assistant organist at first unpaid 1781 and then as a paid employee 1784 of the court chapel conducted by the kapellmeister andrea luchesi his first three piano sonatas named kurfürst elector for their dedication to the elector maximilian friedrich 1708–1784 were published in 1783 maximilian frederick noticed his talent early and subsidised and encouraged the young mans musical studies

maximilian fredericks successor as the elector of bonn was maximilian francis the youngest son of empress maria theresa of austria and he brought notable changes to bonn echoing changes made in vienna by his brother joseph he introduced reforms based on enlightenment philosophy with increased support for education and the arts the teenage beethoven was almost certainly influenced by these changes he may also have been influenced at this time by ideas prominent in freemasonry as neefe and others around beethoven were members of the local chapter of the order of the illuminati
in december 1786 beethoven travelled to vienna at his employers expense for the first time apparently in the hope of studying with mozart the details of their relationship are uncertain including whether they actually met having learned that his mother was ill beethoven returned quickly to bonn in may 1787 his mother died shortly thereafter and his father lapsed deeper into alcoholism as a result he became responsible for the care of his two younger brothers and spent the next five years in bonn
he was introduced in these years to several people who became important in his life franz wegeler a young medical student introduced him to the von breuning family one of whose daughters wegeler eventually married he often visited the von breuning household where he taught piano to some of the children here he encountered german and classical literature the von breuning family environment was less stressful than his own which was increasingly dominated by his fathers decline he also came to the attention of count ferdinand von waldstein who became a lifelong friend and financial supporter
in 1789 beethoven obtained a legal order by which half of his fathers salary was paid directly to him for support of the family he also contributed further to the familys income by playing viola in the court orchestra this familiarised him with a variety of operas including three by mozart that were performed at court in this period he also befriended anton reicha a flautist and violinist of about his own age who was a nephew of the court orchestras conductor josef reicha
from 1790 to 1792 he composed a significant number of works none were published at the time and most are now listed as works without opus number that demonstrated his growing range and maturity musicologists have identified a theme similar to those of his third symphony in a set of variations written in 1791 it was probably on neefes recommendation that beethoven received his first commissions the municipal leaders in bonn had commissioned cantatas to mark the occasion of the death in 1790 of franz joseph ii and the subsequent accession of leopold ii as holy roman emperor the two emperor cantatas woo 87 woo 88 he scored were never performed at the time and they remained lost until the 1880s but they were according to brahms distinctively beethoven through and through and as such prophetic of the tragic style which would mark his music as distinct from the classical tradition
he was probably first introduced to joseph haydn in late 1790 when the latter was travelling to london and stopped in bonn around christmas time a year and a half later they met in bonn on haydns return trip from london to vienna in july 1792 and it is likely that arrangements were made at that time for beethoven to study with the old master


 establishing his career in vienna 
with the electors help he left bonn for vienna in november 1792 amid rumours of war spilling out of france he learned shortly after his arrival that his father had died mozart had also recently died count waldstein in his farewell note to beethoven wrote through uninterrupted diligence you will receive mozarts spirit through haydns hands over the next few years beethoven responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased mozart by studying that masters work and writing works with a distinctly mozartean flavour

beethoven did not immediately set out to establish himself as a composer but rather devoted himself to study and performance working under haydns direction he sought to master counterpoint he also studied violin under ignaz schuppanzigh early in this period he also began receiving occasional instruction from antonio salieri primarily in italian vocal composition style this relationship persisted until at least 1802 and possibly 1809 with haydns departure for england in 1794 beethoven was expected by the elector to return home he chose instead to remain in vienna continuing his instruction in counterpoint with johann albrechtsberger and other teachers although his stipend from the elector expired a number of viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support among them prince joseph franz lobkowitz prince karl lichnowsky and baron gottfried van swieten
by 1793 he had established a reputation as an improviser in the salons of the nobility often playing the preludes and fugues of j s bachs well-tempered clavier his friend nikolaus simrock had begun publishing his compositions the first are believed to be a set of variations woo 66 by 1793 he had established a reputation in vienna as a piano virtuoso but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their publication in 1795 would have greater impact his first public performance in vienna was in march 1795 a concert in which he first performed one of his piano concertos it is uncertain whether this was the first or second documentary evidence is unclear and both concertos were in a similar state of near-completion neither was completed or published for several years shortly after this performance he arranged for the publication of the first of his compositions to which he assigned an opus number the three piano trios opus 1 these works were dedicated to his patron prince lichnowsky and were a financial success beethovens profits were nearly sufficient to cover his living expenses for a year


 musical maturity 
beethoven composed his first six string quartets op 18 between 1798 and 1800 commissioned by and dedicated to prince lobkowitz they were published in 1801 with premieres of his first and second symphonies in 1800 and 1803 he became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following haydn and mozart he also continued to write in other forms turning out widely known piano sonatas like the pathétique sonata op 13 which cooper describes as surpassing any of his previous compositions in strength of character depth of emotion level of originality and ingenuity of motivic and tonal manipulation he also completed his septet op 20 in 1799 which was one of his most popular works during his lifetime

for the premiere of his first symphony he hired the burgtheater on 2 april 1800 and staged an extensive programme of music including works by haydn and mozart as well as his septet the first symphony and one of his piano concertos the latter three works all then unpublished the concert which the allgemeine musikalische zeitung described as the most interesting concert in a long time was not without difficulties among the criticisms was that the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist
mozart and haydn were undeniable influences for example beethovens quintet for piano and winds is said to bear a strong resemblance to mozarts work for the same configuration albeit with his own distinctive touches but his melodies musical development use of modulation and texture and characterisation of emotion all set him apart from his influences and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first published by the end of 1800 beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers

in may 1799 beethoven taught piano to the daughters of hungarian countess anna brunsvik during this time he fell in love with the younger daughter josephine who has therefore been identified as one of the more likely candidates for the addressee of his letter to the immortal beloved in 1812 shortly after these lessons josephine was married to count josef deym beethoven was a regular visitor at their house continuing to teach josephine and playing at parties and concerts her marriage was by all accounts happy despite initial financial problems and the couple had four children her relationship with beethoven intensified after deym died suddenly in 1804
he also had few other students from 1801 to 1805 he tutored ferdinand ries who went on to become a composer and later wrote beethoven remembered a book about their encounters the young carl czerny studied with beethoven from 1801 to 1803 czerny went on to become a renowned music teacher himself instructing franz liszt and on 11 february 1812 gave the vienna premiere of beethovens fifth piano concerto the emperor
his compositions between 1800 and 1802 were dominated by two large-scale orchestral works although he continued to produce other important works such as the piano sonata sonata quasi una fantasia known as the moonlight sonata in the spring of 1801 he completed the creatures of prometheus a ballet the work received numerous performances in 1801 and 1802 and he rushed to publish a piano arrangement to capitalise on its early popularity in the spring of 1802 he completed the second symphony intended for performance at a concert that was cancelled the symphony received its premiere instead at a subscription concert in april 1803 at the theater an der wien where he had been appointed composer in residence in addition to the second symphony the concert also featured the first symphony the third piano concerto and the oratorio christ on the mount of olives reviews were mixed but the concert was a financial success he was able to charge three times the cost of a typical concert ticket
his business dealings with publishers also began to improve in 1802 when his brother kaspar who had previously assisted him casually began to assume a larger role in the management of his affairs in addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works kaspar also began selling some of his earlier unpublished compositions and encouraged him against beethovens preference to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations beethoven acceded to these requests as he could not prevent publishers from hiring others to do similar arrangements of his works


 loss of hearing 
beethoven is reported to have dated his hearing loss from a fit he suffered in 1798 induced by a rage at the interruption of his work—having fallen over he got up to find himself deaf his hearing only ever partially recovered and during its gradual decline was impeded by a severe form of tinnitus as early as 1801 he wrote to friends describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in both professional and social settings although it is likely some of his close friends were already aware of the problems
the cause of his deafness is unknown but has variously been attributed to typhus auto-immune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus and even his habit of immersing his head in cold water to stay awake the explanation from his autopsy was that he had a distended inner ear which developed lesions over time

on the advice of his doctor beethoven lived in the small austrian town of heiligenstadt just outside vienna from april to october 1802 in an attempt to come to terms with his condition there he wrote his heiligenstadt testament a letter to his brothers which records his thoughts of suicide due to his growing deafness and records his resolution to continue living for and through his art over time his hearing loss became profound at the end of the premiere of his ninth symphony in 1824 he had to be turned around to see the tumultuous applause of the audience because he could hear neither it nor the orchestra his hearing loss did not prevent him from composing music but it made playing at concerts—a lucrative source of income—increasingly difficult after a failed attempt in 1811 to perform his own piano concerto no 5 the emperor which was premiered by his student carl czerny he never performed in public again until he directed the premiere performance of the ninth symphony in 1824 which involved him giving cues to conductor michael umlauf
a large collection of his hearing aids such as a special ear horn can be viewed at the beethoven house museum in bonn germany despite his obvious distress czerny remarked that beethoven could still hear speech and music normally until 1812 around 1814 however by the age of 44 he was almost totally deaf and when a group of visitors saw him play a loud arpeggio of thundering bass notes at his piano remarking ist es nicht schön is it not beautiful they felt deep sympathy considering his courage and sense of humour he lost the ability to hear higher frequencies first
as a result of beethovens hearing loss his conversation books are an unusually rich written resource used primarily in the last ten or so years of his life his friends wrote in these books so that he could know what they were saying and he then responded either orally or in the book the books contain discussions about music and other matters and give insights into his thinking they are a source for investigations into how he intended his music should be performed and also his perception of his relationship to art out of a total of 400 conversation books it has been suggested that 264 were destroyed and others were altered after his death by his secretary anton schindler who wished only an idealised biography of the composer to survive however theodore albrecht contests the verity of schindlers destruction of a large number of conversation books


 patronage 

while beethoven earned income from publication of his works and from public performances he also depended on the generosity of patrons for income for whom he gave private performances and copies of works they commissioned for an exclusive period prior to their publication some of his early patrons including prince lobkowitz and prince lichnowsky gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published works
perhaps his most important aristocratic patron was archduke rudolph the youngest son of emperor leopold ii who in 1803 or 1804 began to study piano and composition with him the cleric cardinal-priest and the composer became friends and their meetings continued until 1824 beethoven dedicated 14 compositions to rudolph including the archduke trio 1811 and missa solemnis 1823 rudolph in turn dedicated one of his own compositions to beethoven the letters beethoven wrote to rudolph are today kept at the gesellschaft der musikfreunde in vienna another patron was count later prince andreas razumovsky for whom the string quartets nos 7–9 op 59 rasumovsky were named
in the autumn of 1808 after having been rejected for a position at the royal theatre he received an offer from napoleons brother jérôme bonaparte then king of westphalia for a well-paid position as kapellmeister at the court in cassel to persuade him to stay in vienna the archduke rudolph prince kinsky and prince lobkowitz after receiving representations from the composers friends pledged to pay him a pension of 4000 florins a year only archduke rudolph paid his share of the pension on the agreed date kinsky immediately called to military duty did not contribute and soon died after falling from his horse lobkowitz stopped paying in september 1811 no successors came forward to continue the patronage and beethoven relied mostly on selling composition rights and a small pension after 1815 the effects of these financial arrangements were undermined to some extent by war with france which caused significant inflation when the government printed money to fund its war efforts


 middle period 

beethovens return to vienna from heiligenstadt was marked by a change in musical style and is now designated as the start of his middle or heroic period according to carl czerny beethoven said i am not satisfied with the work i have done so far from now on i intend to take a new way this heroic phase was characterised by a large number of original works composed on a grand scale the first major work employing this new style was the third symphony in e flat known as the eroica this work was longer and larger in scope than any previous symphony when it premiered in early 1805 it received a mixed reception some listeners objected to its length or misunderstood its structure while others viewed it as a masterpiece
the middle period is sometimes associated with a heroic manner of composing but the use of the term heroic has become increasingly controversial in beethoven scholarship the term is more frequently used as an alternative name for the middle period the appropriateness of the term heroic to describe the whole middle period has been questioned as well while some works like the third and fifth symphonies are easy to describe as heroic many others like his symphony no 6 pastoral are not
some of the middle period works extend the musical language he had inherited from haydn and mozart the middle period work includes the third through eighth symphonies the rasumovsky harp and serioso string quartets the waldstein and appassionata piano sonatas christ on the mount of olives the opera fidelio the violin concerto and many other compositions during this time his income came from publishing his works from performances of them and from his patrons his position at the theater an der wien was terminated when the theatre changed management in early 1804 and he was forced to move temporarily to the suburbs of vienna with his friend stephan von breuning this slowed work on fidelio his largest work to date for a time it was delayed again by the austrian censor and finally premiered in november 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the french occupation of the city in addition to being a financial failure this version of fidelio was also a critical failure and beethoven began revising it
during may 1809 when the attacking forces of napoleon bombarded vienna according to ferdinand ries beethoven very worried that the noise would destroy what remained of his hearing hid in the basement of his brothers house covering his ears with pillows
the work of the middle period established beethoven as a master in a review from 1810 he was enshrined by e t a hoffmann as one of the three great romantic composers along with haydn and mozart hoffmann called his fifth symphony one of the most important works of the age


 personal and family difficulties 
beethovens love life was hampered by class issues in late 1801 he met a young countess julie giulietta guicciardi through the brunsvik family at a time when he was giving regular piano lessons to josephine brunsvik he mentions his love for julie in a november 1801 letter to his boyhood friend franz wegeler but he could not consider marrying her due to the class difference he later dedicated his sonata no 14 now commonly known as the moonlight sonata to her
his relationship with josephine brunsvik deepened after the death in 1804 of her aristocratic first husband the count joseph deym he wrote josephine 15 passionate love letters from late 1804 to around 1809/10 although his feelings were obviously reciprocated josephine was forced by her family to withdraw from him in 1807 she cited her duty and the fact that she would have lost the custodianship of her aristocratic children had she married a commoner after josephine married baron von stackelberg in 1810 beethoven may have proposed unsuccessfully to therese malfatti the supposed dedicatee of für elise his status as a commoner may again have interfered with those plans

in the spring of 1811 beethoven became seriously ill suffering headaches and high fever on the advice of his doctor he spent six weeks in the bohemian spa town of teplitz the following winter which was dominated by work on the seventh symphony he was again ill and his doctor ordered him to spend the summer of 1812 at the spa teplitz it is certain that he was at teplitz when he wrote a love letter to his immortal beloved the identity of the intended recipient has long been a subject of debate candidates include julie guicciardi therese malfatti josephine brunsvik and antonie brentano
he visited his brother johann at the end of october 1812 he wished to end johanns cohabitation with therese obermayer a woman who already had an illegitimate child he was unable to convince johann to end the relationship and appealed to the local civic and religious authorities johann and therese married on 9 november

in early 1813 beethoven apparently went through a difficult emotional period and his compositional output dropped his personal appearance degraded—it had generally been neat—as did his manners in public especially when dining he took care of his brother who was suffering from tuberculosis and his family an expense that he claimed left him penniless
beethoven was finally motivated to begin significant composition again in june 1813 when news arrived of the defeat of one of napoleons armies at vitoria spain by a coalition of forces under the duke of wellington this news stimulated him to write the battle symphony known as wellingtons victory it was first performed on 8 december along with his seventh symphony at a charity concert for victims of the war the work was a popular hit probably because of its programmatic style which was entertaining and easy to understand it received repeat performances at concerts he staged in january and february 1814 his renewed popularity led to demands for a revival of fidelio which in its third revised version was also well received at its july opening that summer he composed a piano sonata for the first time in five years no 27 opus 90 this work was in a markedly more romantic style than his earlier sonatas he was also one of many composers who produced music in a patriotic vein to entertain the many heads of state and diplomats who came to the congress of vienna that began in november 1814 his output of songs included his only song cycle an die ferne geliebte and the extraordinarily expressive second setting of the poem an die hoffnung op 94 in 1815 compared to its first setting in 1805 a gift for josephine brunsvik it was far more dramatic  the entire spirit is that of an operatic scena


 custody struggle and illness 
between 1815 and 1817 beethovens output dropped again he attributed part of this to a lengthy illness he called it an inflammatory fever that afflicted him for more than a year starting in october 1816 biographers have speculated on a variety of other reasons that also contributed to the decline including the difficulties in the personal lives of his would-be paramours and the harsh censorship policies of the austrian government the illness and death of his brother kaspar from tuberculosis may also have played a role

kaspar had been ill for some time and beethoven spent a small fortune in 1815 on his care after kaspar died on 15 november 1815 beethoven immediately became embroiled in a protracted legal dispute with kaspars wife johanna over custody of their son karl then nine years old beethoven who considered johanna an unfit parent because of her morals she had an illegitimate child by a different father before marrying kaspar and had been convicted of theft and financial management had successfully applied to kaspar to have himself named sole guardian of the boy a late codicil to kaspars will gave him and johanna joint guardianship while beethoven was successful at having his nephew removed from her custody in february 1816 the case was not fully resolved until 1820 and he was frequently preoccupied by the demands of the litigation and seeing to the welfare of karl whom he first placed in a private school
the austrian court system had one court for the nobility and members of the landtafel the landrechte and many other courts for commoners among them the civil court of the vienna magistrate beethoven disguised the fact that the dutch van in his name did not denote nobility as does the german von and his case was tried in the landrechte owing to his influence with the court beethoven felt assured of the favourable outcome of being awarded sole guardianship while giving evidence to the landrechte however beethoven was unable to prove being of noble birth and as a consequence on 18 december 1818 the case was transferred to the magistracy where he lost sole guardianship
he appealed and regained custody johannas appeal to the emperor was not successful the emperor washed his hands of the matter during the years of custody that followed beethoven attempted to ensure that karl lived to the highest moral standards beethoven had an overbearing manner and frequently interfered in his nephews life karl attempted suicide on 31 july 1826 by shooting himself in the head he survived and was brought to his mothers house where he recuperated he and beethoven were reconciled but karl insisted on joining the army and last saw beethoven in january 1827


 late works 
beethoven began a renewed study of older music including works by johann sebastian bach and george frideric handel that were then being published in the first attempts at complete editions he composed the overture the consecration of the house which was the first work to attempt to incorporate these influences a new style emerged now called his late period he returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade the works of the late period are commonly held to include the last five piano sonatas and the diabelli variations the last two sonatas for cello and piano the late string quartets see below and two works for very large forces the missa solemnis and the ninth symphony
by early 1818 his health had improved and his nephew moved in with him in january on the downside his hearing had deteriorated to the point that conversation became difficult necessitating the use of conversation books his household management had also improved somewhat nanette streicher who had assisted in his care during his illness continued to provide some support and he finally found a skilled cook his musical output in 1818 was still somewhat reduced but included song collections and the hammerklavier sonata as well as sketches for two symphonies that eventually coalesced into the epic ninth in 1819 he was again preoccupied by the legal processes around karl and began work on the diabelli variations and the missa solemnis
for the next few years he continued to work on the missa composing piano sonatas and bagatelles to satisfy the demands of publishers and the need for income and completing the diabelli variations he was ill again for an extended time in 1821 and completed the missa in 1823 three years after its original due date he also opened discussions with his publishers over the possibility of producing a complete edition of his work an idea that was arguably not fully realised until 1971 his brother johann began to take a hand in his business affairs much in the way kaspar had earlier locating older unpublished works to offer for publication and offering the missa to multiple publishers with the goal of getting a higher price for it
two commissions in 1822 improved his financial prospects the philharmonic society of london offered a commission for a symphony and prince nikolas golitsin of st petersburg offered to pay beethovens price for three string quartets the first of these commissions spurred him to finish the ninth symphony which was first performed along with the missa solemnis on 7 may 1824 to great acclaim at the kärntnertortheater the allgemeine musikalische zeitung gushed inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world and carl czerny wrote that his symphony breathes such a fresh lively indeed youthful spirit  so much power innovation and beauty as ever came from the head of this original man although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads unlike his more lucrative earlier concerts this did not make him much money as the expenses of mounting it were significantly higher a second concert on 24 may in which the producer guaranteed beethoven a minimum fee was poorly attended nephew karl noted that many people had already gone into the country it was beethovens last public concert

beethoven then turned to writing the string quartets for golitsin this series of quartets known as the late quartets went far beyond what musicians or audiences were ready for at that time one musician commented that we know there is something there but we do not know what it is composer louis spohr called them indecipherable uncorrected horrors opinion has changed considerably from the time of their first bewildered reception their forms and ideas inspired musicians and composers including richard wagner and béla bartók and continue to do so of the late quartets beethovens favourite was the fourteenth quartet op 131 in c♯ minor which he rated as his most perfect single work the last musical wish of schubert was to hear the op 131 quartet which he did on 14 november 1828 five days before his death
beethoven wrote the last quartets amidst failing health in april 1825 he was bedridden and remained ill for about a month the illness—or more precisely his recovery from it—is remembered for having given rise to the deeply felt slow movement of the fifteenth quartet which he called holy song of thanks heiliger dankgesang to the divinity from one made well he went on to complete the quartets now numbered thirteenth fourteenth and sixteenth the last work completed by beethoven was the substitute final movement of the thirteenth quartet which replaced the difficult grosse fuge shortly thereafter in december 1826 illness struck again with episodes of vomiting and diarrhoea that nearly ended his life
in 1825 his nine symphonies were performed in a cycle for the first time by the leipzig gewandhaus orchestra under johann philipp christian schulz this was repeated in 1826


 illness and death 

beethoven was bedridden for most of his remaining months and many friends came to visit he died on 26 march 1827 at the age of 56 during a thunderstorm his friend anselm hüttenbrenner who was present at the time said that there was a peal of thunder at the moment of death an autopsy revealed significant liver damage which may have been due to heavy alcohol consumption it also revealed considerable dilation of the auditory and other related nerves
beethovens funeral procession on 29 march 1827 was attended by an estimated 20,000 viennese citizens franz schubert who died the following year and was buried next to him was one of the torchbearers he was buried in a dedicated grave in the währing cemetery north-west of vienna after a requiem mass at the church of the holy trinity dreifaltigkeitskirche his remains were exhumed for study in 1862 and moved in 1888 to viennas zentralfriedhof in 2012 his crypt was checked to see if his teeth had been stolen during a series of grave robberies of other famous viennese composers
there is dispute about the cause of beethovens death alcoholic cirrhosis syphilis infectious hepatitis lead poisoning sarcoidosis and whipples disease have all been proposed friends and visitors before and after his death clipped locks of his hair some of which have been preserved and subjected to additional analysis as have skull fragments removed during the 1862 exhumation some of these analyses have led to controversial assertions that he was accidentally poisoned to death by excessive doses of lead-based treatments administered under instruction from his doctor


 music 

beethoven is acknowledged to be one of the giants of classical music together with bach and johannes brahms he is referred to as one of the three bs who epitomize that tradition he was a pivotal figure in the transition from the 18th century musical classicism to 19th century romanticism and his influence on subsequent generations of composers was profound his music features twice on the voyager golden record a phonograph record containing a broad sample of the images common sounds languages and music of earth sent into outer space with the two voyager probes


 overview 
beethoven composed in several musical genres and for a variety of instrument combinations his works for symphony orchestra include nine symphonies of which the ninth symphony includes a chorus and about a dozen pieces of occasional music he wrote seven concerti for one or more soloists and orchestra as well as four shorter works that include soloists accompanied by orchestra his only opera is fidelio other vocal works with orchestral accompaniment include two masses and a number of shorter works
his large body of compositions for piano includes 32 piano sonatas and numerous shorter pieces including arrangements of some of his other works works with piano accompaniment include 10 violin sonatas 5 cello sonatas and a sonata for french horn as well as numerous lieder
he also wrote a significant quantity of chamber music in addition to 16 string quartets he wrote five works for string quintet seven for piano trio five for string trio and more than a dozen works for various combinations of wind instruments


 the three periods 
beethovens compositional career is usually divided into early middle and late periods in this scheme his early period is taken to last until about 1802 the middle period from about 1803 to about 1814 and the late period from about 1815
in his early period his work was strongly influenced by his predecessors haydn and mozart he also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work some important pieces from the early period are the first and second symphonies the set of six string quartets opus 18 the first two piano concertos and the first dozen or so piano sonatas including the famous pathétique sonata op 13
his middle heroic period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness it includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle middle-period works include six symphonies nos 3–8 the last three piano concertos the triple concerto and violin concerto five string quartets nos 7–11 several piano sonatas including the moonlight waldstein and appassionata sonatas the kreutzer violin sonata and his only opera fidelio
beethovens late period began around 1815 works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth their formal innovations and their intense highly personal expression the string quartet op 131 has seven linked movements and the ninth symphony adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement other compositions from this period include the missa solemnis the last five string quartets including the massive grosse fuge and the last five piano sonatas


 character 

beethovens life was troubled by his encroaching loss of hearing and chronic abdominal pain since his twenties he contemplated suicide as documented in his heiligenstadt testament he was often irascible nevertheless he had a close and devoted circle of friends all his life thought to have been attracted by his strength of personality towards the end of his life his friends competed in their efforts to help him cope with his incapacities
sources show beethovens disdain for authority and for social rank he stopped performing at the piano if the audience chatted amongst themselves or afforded him less than their full attention at soirées he refused to perform if suddenly called upon to do so eventually after many confrontations the archduke rudolph decreed that the usual rules of court etiquette did not apply to beethoven
he was attracted to the ideals of the age of enlightenment in 1804 when napoleons imperial ambitions became clear beethoven took hold of the title page of his third symphony and scratched the name bonaparte out so violently that he made a hole in the paper he later changed the works title to sinfonia eroica composta per festeggiare il sovvenire dun granduom heroic symphony composed to celebrate the memory of a great man and he rededicated it to his patron prince joseph franz von lobkowitz at whose palace it was first performed
the fourth movement of his ninth symphony features an elaborate choral setting of schillers ode an die freude ode to joy an optimistic hymn championing the brotherhood of humanity
