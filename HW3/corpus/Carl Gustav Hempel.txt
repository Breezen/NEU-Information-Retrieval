carl gustav peter hempel january 8 1905 – november 9 1997 was a german writer and philosopher he was a major figure in logical empiricism a 20th-century movement in the philosophy of science he is especially well known for his articulation of the deductive-nomological model of scientific explanation which was considered the standard model of scientific explanation during the 1950s and 1960s he is also known for the raven paradox also known as hempels paradox


 biography 
hempel studied mathematics physics and philosophy at the university of göttingen and subsequently at the university of berlin and the heidelberg university in göttingen he encountered david hilbert and was impressed by his program attempting to base all mathematics on solid logical foundations derived from a limited number of axioms
after moving to berlin hempel participated in a congress on scientific philosophy in 1929 where he met rudolf carnap and became involved in the berlin circle of philosophers associated with the vienna circle in 1934 he received his doctoral degree from the university of berlin with a dissertation on probability theory
within a year of completing his doctorate the increasingly repressive and anti-semitic nazi regime in germany had prompted hempel to emigrate – his wife was of jewish ancestry – to belgium in this he was aided by the scientist paul oppenheim with whom he co-authored the book der typusbegriff im lichte der neuen logik on typology and logic in 1936 in 1937 hempel emigrated to the united states where he accepted a position as carnaps assistant at the university of chicago he later held positions at the city college of new york 1939–1948 yale university 1948–1955 and princeton university where he taught alongside thomas kuhn and remained until made emeritus in 1973 between 1974 and 1976 he was an emeritus at the hebrew university in jerusalem before becoming university professor of philosophy at the university of pittsburgh in 1977 and teaching there until 1985 in 1989 the department of philosophy at princeton university renamed its three lecture series the carl g hempel lectures in his honor
hempel never embraced the term logical positivism as an accurate description of the vienna circle and berlin group preferring to describe those philosophers – and himself – as logical empiricists he believed that the term positivism with its roots in auguste comte invoked a materialist metaphysics that empiricists need not embrace he regarded ludwig wittgenstein as a philosopher with a genius for stating philosophical insights in striking and memorable language but believed that he or at least the wittgenstein of the tractatus made claims that could only be supported by recourse to metaphysics to hempel metaphysics involved claims to know things which were not knowable that is metaphysical hypotheses were incapable of confirmation or disconfirmation by evidence
in 2005 the city of oranienburg hempels birthplace renamed one of its streets carl-gustav-hempel-strasse in his memory
