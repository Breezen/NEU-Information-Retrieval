the lunar nodes are the orbital nodes of the moon that is the two points at which the orbit of the moon crosses the ecliptic the ascending or north node is where the moon moves into the northern ecliptic hemisphere while the descending or south node is where the moon enters the southern ecliptic hemisphere
eclipses involving the moon occur only near the lunar nodes a solar eclipse occurs when the passage of the moon through a node coincides with the new moon while a lunar eclipse occurs when the passage coincides with the full moon a lunar eclipse may occur if the full moon is within 11° 38 ecliptic longitude of either node while a solar eclipse may occur if the new moon is within 17° 25 of either node
since the orbital plane of the moon precesses in space the lunar nodes also precess around the ecliptic completing one revolution called a draconic or nodal period in 18.612958 years 6,798.383 days note that this is not the same length as a saros the same cycle measured against an inertial frame of reference such as icrs relative to the fixed stars is 18.599525 years
the two solar eclipses of july 2000 on the 1st and 31st days occurred around the time when the moon was at its ascending node ascending-node eclipses recur after one draconic year on average which is about 0.94901 gregorian year and the same goes for descending-node eclipses


 names and symbols 

the nodes are called by different names in different areas of the world
in ancient european texts the ascending node is referred to as the dragons head caput draconis or anabibazon its symbol is  the astronomical and astrological symbol for the dragons head by the same analogy the descending node is also known as the dragons tail cauda draconis or catabibazon and its symbol is the inversion of that of the ascending node 
in hindu astronomy the ascending node ☊ is called rahu and the descending node ☋ is called ketu in tibetan astrology partially based on the kalachakra tantra the descending node is named kalagni


 declination extremes 

the moons orbit is inclined about 5.14° to the ecliptic hence the moon can be up to about 5° north or south of the ecliptic the ecliptic is inclined about 23.44° to the celestial equator whose plane is perpendicular to the rotational axis of earth as a result once during the 18.6-year nodal period when the ascending node of the moons orbit coincides with the vernal equinox the moons declination reaches a maximum and minimum northern and southern extremes about 28.6° from the celestial equator therefore the moonrise or moonset azimuth has its northern- and southern-most points on the horizon the moon at culmination has its lowest and highest altitude when the body transits the meridian and first sightings of the new moon potentially have their latest times furthermore occultations by the moon of the pleiades star cluster which is over 4° north of the ecliptic occur during a comparatively brief period once every nodal period


 effect on tides 
the precession of the lunar nodes has a small effect on earths tides the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa determines mean lower low water mllw at a location by averaging the height of the lowest tide recorded at that location each day during a 19-year recording period known as the national tidal datum epoch the 19-year recording period is the nearest full-year count to the 18.6-year cycle of the lunar nodes
