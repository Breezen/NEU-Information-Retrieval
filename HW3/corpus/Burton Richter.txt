burton richter born march 22 1931 is a nobel prize-winning american physicist he led the stanford linear accelerator center slac team which co-discovered the jψ meson in 1974 alongside the brookhaven national laboratory bnl team led by samuel ting this discovery was part of the so-called november revolution of particle physics he was the slac director from 1984 to 1999


 life and work 
a native of new york city richter was born into a jewish family in brooklyn and was raised in the queens neighborhood of far rockaway his parents were fanny pollack and abraham richter a textile worker he graduated from far rockaway high school a school that also produced fellow laureates baruch samuel blumberg and richard feynman he attended mercersburg academy in pennsylvania then continued on to study at the massachusetts institute of technology where he received his bachelors degree in 1952 and his phd in 1956 he was director of the stanford linear accelerator center slac from 1984 to 1999
as a professor at stanford university richter built a particle accelerator called spear stanford positron-electron asymmetric ring with the help of david ritson and the support of the us atomic energy commission with it he led a team that discovered a new subatomic particle he called a ψ psi this discovery was also made by the team led by samuel ting at brookhaven national laboratory but he called the particle j the particle thus became known as the jψ meson richter and ting were jointly awarded the 1976 nobel prize in physics for their work
richter was a member of the jason advisory group and serves on the board of directors of scientists and engineers for america an organization focused on promoting sound science in american government
in may 2007 he visited iran and sharif university of technology
in 2012 president barack obama announced that burton richter was a co-recipient of the enrico fermi award along with mildred dresselhaus
