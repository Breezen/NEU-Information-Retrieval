antony hewish  born 11 may 1924 is a british radio astronomer who won the nobel prize for physics in 1974 together with fellow radio-astronomer martin ryle for his role in the discovery of pulsars he was also awarded the eddington medal of the royal astronomical society in 1969


 early life and education 
he attended kings college taunton his undergraduate degree at gonville and caius college cambridge was interrupted by war service at the royal aircraft establishment and at the telecommunications research establishment where he worked with martin ryle returning to cambridge in 1946 hewish completed his degree and immediately joined ryles research team at the cavendish laboratory obtaining his phd in 1952 hewish made both practical and theoretical advances in the observation and exploitation of the apparent scintillations of radio sources due to their radiation impinging upon plasma this led him to propose and secure funding for the construction of the interplanetary scintillation array a large array radio telescope at the mullard radio astronomy observatory mrao cambridge to conduct a high time-resolution radio survey of interplanetary scintillation


 career and research 
hewish was professor of radio astronomy at the cavendish laboratory from 1971 to 1989 and head of the mrao from 1982 to 1988 he developed an association with the royal institution in london when it was directed by sir lawrence bragg in 1965 he was invited to co-deliver the royal institution christmas lecture on exploration of the universe he subsequently gave several friday evening discourses and was made a professor of the royal institution in 1977 hewish is a fellow of churchill college cambridge he is also a member of the advisory council for the campaign for science and engineering


 awards and honours

nobel prize for physics jointly 1974
hughes medal royal society 1977
elected a fellow of the institute of physics finstp in 1998


 nobel prize 
one of his phd students jocelyn bell noted the radio source which was ultimately recognised as the first pulsar the paper announcing the discovery had five authors hewishs name being listed first bells second hewish and martin ryle were awarded the nobel prize in physics in 1974 for work on the development of radio aperture synthesis and its role in the discovery of pulsars the nobel award to ryle and hewish without the inclusion of bell as a co-recipient was controversial and was roundly condemned by hewishs fellow astronomer fred hoyle see nobel prize controversies


 personal life 
hewish married marjorie elizabeth catherine richards in 1950 they have a son a physicist and a daughter a language teacher


 religious views 
hewish has argued that religion and science are complementary in the foreword to questions of truth hewish writes the ghostly presence of virtual particles defies rational common sense and is non-intuitive for those unacquainted with physics religious belief in god and christian belief  may seem strange to common-sense thinking but when the most elementary physical things behave in this way we should be prepared to accept that the deepest aspects of our existence go beyond our common-sense understanding
