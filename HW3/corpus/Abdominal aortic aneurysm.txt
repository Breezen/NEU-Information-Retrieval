abdominal aortic aneurysm aaa or triple a is a localized enlargement of the abdominal aorta such that the diameter is greater than 3 cm or more than 50% larger than normal diameter they usually cause no symptoms except when ruptured occasionally abdominal back or leg pain may occur large aneurysms can sometimes be felt by pushing on the abdomen rupture may result in pain in the abdomen or back low blood pressure or loss of consciousness and often results in death
aaas occur most commonly in those over 50 years old in men and among those with a family history additional risk factors include smoking high blood pressure and other heart or blood vessel diseases genetic conditions with an increased risk include marfan syndrome and ehlers-danlos syndrome aaas are the most common form of aortic aneurysm about 85% occur below the kidneys with the rest either at the level of or above the kidneys in the united states screening with abdominal ultrasound is recommended for males between 65 and 75 years of age with a history of smoking in the united kingdom and sweden screening all men over 65 is recommended once an aneurysm is found further ultrasounds are typically done on a regular basis
not smoking is the single best way to prevent the disease other methods of prevention include treating high blood pressure treating high blood cholesterol and not being overweight surgery is usually recommended when an aaas diameter grows to 5.5 cm in males and 5.0 cm in females other reasons for repair include the presence of symptoms and a rapid increase in size more than one centimeter per year repair may be either by open surgery or endovascular aneurysm repair evar as compared to open surgery evar has a lower risk of death in the short term and a shorter hospital stay but may not always be an option there does not appear to be a difference in longer term outcomes between the two with evar there is a higher need for repeat procedures
aaas affect between 2 and 8% of males over the age of 65 rates among women are one-fourth as high in those with an aneurysm less than 5.5 cm the risk of rupture in the next year is less than 1 among those with an aneurysm between 5.5 and 7 cm the risk is about 10 while for those with an aneurysm greater than 7 cm the risk is about 33 mortality if ruptured is 85% to 90 during 2013 aortic aneurysms resulted in 168,200 deaths up from 100,000 in 1990 in the united states aaas resulted in between 10,000 and 18,000 deaths in 2009


 signs and symptoms 

the vast majority of aneurysms are asymptomatic however as abdominal aortic aneurysms expand they may become painful and lead to pulsating sensations in the abdomen or pain in the chest lower back or scrotum the risk of rupture is high in a symptomatic aneurysm which is therefore considered an indication for surgery the complications include rupture peripheral embolization acute aortic occlusion and aortocaval between the aorta and inferior vena cava or aortoduodenal between the aorta and the duodenum fistulae on physical examination a palpable and pulsatile abdominal mass can be noted bruits can be present in case of renal or visceral arterial stenosis


 aortic rupture 

the signs and symptoms of a ruptured aaa may include severe pain in the lower back flank abdomen or groin a mass that pulses with the heart beat may also be felt the bleeding can lead to a hypovolemic shock with low blood pressure and a fast heart rate this may lead to brief passing out
the mortality of aaa rupture is as high as 90 percent 65 to 75 percent of patients die before they arrive at the hospital and up to 90 percent die before they reach the operating room the bleeding can be retroperitoneal or into the abdominal cavity rupture can also create a connection between the aorta and intestine or inferior vena cava flank ecchymosis appearance of a bruise is a sign of retroperitoneal bleeding and is also called grey turners sign
aortic aneurysm rupture may be mistaken for the pain of kidney stones or muscle related back pain


 causes 
the exact causes of the degenerative process remain unclear there are however some hypotheses and well-defined risk factors
tobacco smoking more than 90% of people who develop an aaa have smoked at some point in their lives
alcohol and hypertension the inflammation caused by prolonged use of alcohol and hypertensive effects from abdominal edema which leads to hemorrhoids esophageal varices and other conditions is also considered a long-term cause of aaa
genetic influences the influence of genetic factors is high aaa is four to six times more common in male siblings of known patients with a risk of 20-30 the high familial prevalence rate is most notable in male individuals there are many hypotheses about the exact genetic disorder that could cause higher incidence of aaa among male members of the affected families some presumed that the influence of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency could be crucial while other experimental works favored the hypothesis of x-linked mutation which would explain the lower incidence in heterozygous females other hypotheses of genetic causes have also been formulated connective tissue disorders such as marfan syndrome and ehlers-danlos syndrome have also been strongly associated with aaa both relapsing polychondritis and pseudoxanthoma elasticum may cause abdominal aortic aneurysm
atherosclerosis the aaa was long considered to be caused by atherosclerosis because the walls of the aaa frequently carry an atherosclerotic burden however this hypothesis cannot be used to explain the initial defect and the development of occlusion which is observed in the process
other causes of the development of aaa include infection trauma arteritis and cystic medial necrosis


 pathophysiology 

the most striking histopathological changes of the aneurysmatic aorta are seen in the tunica media and intima layers these changes include the accumulation of lipids in foam cells extracellular free cholesterol crystals calcifications thrombosis and ulcerations and ruptures of the layers adventitial inflammatory infiltrate is present however the degradation of the tunica media by means of a proteolytic process seems to be the basic pathophysiologic mechanism of aaa development some researchers report increased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases in individuals with aaa this leads to elimination of elastin from the media rendering the aortic wall more susceptible to the influence of blood pressure other reports have suggested the serine protease granzyme b may contribute to aortic aneurysm rupture through the cleavage of decorin leading to disrupted collagen organization and reduced tensile strength of the adventitia there is also a reduced amount of vasa vasorum in the abdominal aorta compared to the thoracic aorta consequently the tunica media must rely mostly on diffusion for nutrition which makes it more susceptible to damage
hemodynamics affect the development of aaa which has a predilection for the infrarenal aorta the histological structure and mechanical characteristics of the infrarenal aorta differ from those of the thoracic aorta the diameter decreases from the root to the aortic bifurcation and the wall of the infrarenal aorta also contains a lesser proportion of elastin the mechanical tension in the abdominal aortic wall is therefore higher than in the thoracic aortic wall the elasticity and distensibility also decline with age which can result in gradual dilatation of the segment higher intraluminal pressure in patients with arterial hypertension markedly contributes to the progression of the pathological process suitable hemodynamic conditions may be linked to specific intraluminal thrombus ilt patterns along the aortic lumen which in turn may affect aaas development


 diagnosis 
an abdominal aortic aneurysm is usually diagnosed by physical exam abdominal ultrasound or ct scan plain abdominal radiographs may show the outline of an aneurysm when its walls are calcified however this is the case in less than half of all aneurysms ultrasonography is used to screen for aneurysms and to determine the size of any present additionally free peritoneal fluid can be detected it is noninvasive and sensitive but the presence of bowel gas or obesity may limit its usefulness ct scan has a nearly 100% sensitivity for an aneurysm and is also useful in preoperative planning detailing the anatomy and possibility for endovascular repair in the case of suspected rupture it can also reliably detect retroperitoneal fluid alternative less often used methods for visualization of an aneurysm include mri and angiography
an aneurysm ruptures if the mechanical stress tension per area exceeds the local wall strength consequently peak wall stress pws and peak wall rupture risk pwrr have been found to be more reliable parameters than diameter to assess aaa rupture risk medical software allows computing these rupture risk indices from standard clinical ct data and provides a patient-specific aaa rupture risk diagnosis this type of biomechanical approach has been shown to accurately predict the location of aaa rupture


 classification 
abdominal aortic aneurysms are commonly divided according to their size and symptomatology an aneurysm is usually defined as an outer aortic diameter over 3 cm normal diameter of the aorta is around 2 cm or more than 50% of normal diameter if the outer diameter exceeds 5.5 cm the aneurysm is considered to be large a ruptured aaa is a clinical diagnosis involving the presence of the triad of abdominal pain shock and a pulsatile abdominal mass if these conditions are present indicating aaa rupture no further clinical investigations are needed before surgery


 prevention 
smoking cessation
treatment of hypertension


 screening 
the us preventive services task force uspstf recommends a single screening abdominal ultrasound for abdominal aortic aneurysm in males age 65 to 75 years who have a history of smoking it is unclear if screening is useful in women who have smoked and the uspstf recommend against screening in women who have never smoked
in the united kingdom and sweden one time screening is recommended in all males over 65 years of age this has been found to decrease the risk of death from aaa by 42% with a number needed to screen of just over 200 australia has no guideline on screening
repeat ultrasounds should be carried out in those who have an aortic size greater than 3.0 cm in those whose aorta is between 3.0 and 3.9 cm this should be every three years if between 4.0 and 4.4 cm every two year and if between 4.5 and 5.4 cm every year


 management 
the treatment options for asymptomatic aaa are conservative management surveillance with a view to eventual repair and immediate repair two modes of repair are available for an aaa open aneurysm repair and endovascular aneurysm repair evar an intervention is often recommended if the aneurysm grows more than 1 cm per year or it is bigger than 5.5 cm repair is also indicated for symptomatic aneurysms


 conservative 
conservative management is indicated in people where repair carries a high risk of mortality and in patients where repair is unlikely to improve life expectancy the mainstay of the conservative treatment is smoking cessation
surveillance is indicated in small asymptomatic aneurysms less than 5.5 cm where the risk of repair exceeds the risk of rupture as an aaa grows in diameter the risk of rupture increases surveillance until an aneurysm has reached a diameter of 5.5 cm has not been shown to have a higher risk as compared to early intervention


 medication 
no medical therapy has been found to be effective at decreasing the growth rate or rupture rate of asymptomatic aaas blood pressure and lipids should however be treated per usual


 surgery 
the threshold for repair varies slightly from individual to individual depending on the balance of risks and benefits when considering repair versus ongoing surveillance the size of an individuals native aorta may influence this along with the presence of comorbidities that increase operative risk or decrease life expectancy evidence however does not support repair if the size is between 4 cm and 5.5 cm


 open repair 

open repair is indicated in young patients as an elective procedure or in growing or large symptomatic or ruptured aneurysms the aorta must be clamped off during the repair denying blood to the abdominal organs and sections of the spinal cord this can cause a range of complications it is essential to make the critical part of the operation fast so the incision is typically made large enough to facilitate the fastest repair recovery after open aaa surgery takes significant time the minimums are a few days in intensive care a week total in the hospital and a few months before full recovery


 endovascular repair 

endovascular repair first became practical in the 1990s and although it is now an established alternative to open repair its role is yet to be clearly defined it is generally indicated in older high-risk patients or patients unfit for open repair however endovascular repair is feasible for only a proportion of aaas depending on the morphology of the aneurysm the main advantages over open repair are that there is less peri-operative mortality less time in intensive care less time in hospital overall and earlier return to normal activity disadvantages of endovascular repair include a requirement for more frequent ongoing hospital reviews and a higher chance of further procedures being required according to the latest studies the evar procedure does not offer any benefit for overall survival or health-related quality of life compared to open surgery although aneurysm-related mortality is lower in patients unfit for open repair evar plus conservative management was associated with no benefit more complications subsequent procedures and higher costs compared to conservative management alone endovascular treatment for paraanastomotic aneurysms after aortobiiliac reconstruction is also a possibility a 2017 cochrane review found tentative evidence of no difference in outcomes between endovascular and open repair of ruptured aaa in the first month


 rupture 
in those with aortic rupture of the aaa treatment is immediate surgical repair there appears to be benefits to allowing permissive hypotension and limiting the use of intravenous fluids during transport to the operating room


 prognosis 
although the current standard of determining rupture risk is based on maximum diameter it is known that smaller aaas that fall below this threshold diameter5.5 cm may also rupture and larger aaas diameter5.5 cm may remain stable in one report it was shown that 10–24% of ruptured aaas were less than 5 cm in diameter it has also been reported that of 473 non-repaired aaas examined from autopsy reports there were 118 cases of rupture 13% of which were less than 5 cm in diameter this study also showed that 60% of the aaas greater than 5 cm including 54% of those aaas between 7.1 and 10 cm never experienced rupture vorp et al later deduced from the findings of darling et al that if the maximum diameter criterion were followed for the 473 subjects only 7% 34/473 of cases would have succumbed to rupture prior to surgical intervention as the diameter was less than 5 cm with 25% 116/473 of cases possibly undergoing unnecessary surgery since these aaas may never have ruptured
alternative methods of rupture assessment have been recently reported the majority of these approaches involve the numerical analysis of aaas using the common engineering technique of the finite element method fem to determine the wall stress distributions recent reports have shown that these stress distributions have been shown to correlate to the overall geometry of the aaa rather than solely to the maximum diameter it is also known that wall stress alone does not completely govern failure as an aaa will usually rupture when the wall stress exceeds the wall strength in light of this rupture assessment may be more accurate if both the patient-specific wall stress is coupled together with patient-specific wall strength a non-invasive method of determining patient-dependent wall strength was recently reported with more traditional approaches to strength determination via tensile testing performed by other researchers in the field some of the more recently proposed aaa rupture-risk assessment methods include aaa wall stress aaa expansion rate degree of asymmetry presence of intraluminal thrombus ilt a rupture potential index rpi a finite element analysis rupture index feari biomechanical factors coupled with computer analysis growth of ilt geometrical parameters of the aaa and also a method of determining aaa growth and rupture based on mathematical models
the post-operative mortality for an already ruptured aaa has slowly decreased over several decades but remains higher than 40 however if the aaa is surgically repaired before rupture the post-operative mortality rate is substantially lower approximately 1-6


 epidemiology 
the occurrence of aaa varies by ethnicity in the united kingdom the rate of aaa in caucasian men older than 65 years is about 4.7 while in asian men it is 0.45 it is also less common in individuals of african and hispanic heritage they occur four times more often in men than women
there are at least 13,000 deaths yearly in the us secondary to aaa rupture the peak number of new cases per year among males is around 70 years of age the percentage of males affected over 60 years is 2–6 the frequency is much higher in smokers than in non-smokers 81 and the risk decreases slowly after smoking cessation in the us the incidence of aaa is 2–4% in the adult population
rupture of the aaa occurs in 1–3% of men aged 65 or more the mortality is 70–95


 history 
the first historical records about aaa are from ancient rome in the 2nd century ad when greek surgeon antyllus tried to treat the aaa with proximal and distal ligature central incision and removal of thrombotic material from the aneurysm however attempts to treat the aaa surgically were unsuccessful until 1923 in that year rudolph matas who also proposed the concept of endoaneurysmorrhaphy performed the first successful aortic ligation on a human other methods that were successful in treating the aaa included wrapping the aorta with polyethene cellophane which induced fibrosis and restricted the growth of the aneurysm endovascular aneurysm repair was first performed in the late 1980s and has been widely adopted in the subsequent decades endovascular repair was first used for treating a ruptured aneurysm in nottingham in 1994

 research 


 risk assessment 
there have been many calls for alternative approaches to rupture risk assessment over the past number of years with many believing that a biomechanics-based approach may be more suitable than the current diameter approach numerical modeling is a valuable tool to researchers allowing approximate wall stresses to be calculated thus revealing the rupture potential of a particular aneurysm experimental models are required to validate these numerical results and provide a further insight into the biomechanical behavior of the aaa in vivo aaas exhibit a varying range of material strengths from localised weak hypoxic regions to much stronger regions and areas of calcifications


 experimental models 
experimental models can now be manufactured using a novel technique involving the injection-moulding lost-wax manufacturing process to create patient-specific anatomically correct aaa replicas work has also focused on developing more realistic material analogues to those in vivo and recently a novel range of silicone-rubbers was created allowing the varying material properties of the aaa to be more accurately represented these rubber models can also be used in a variety of experimental testing from stress analysis using the photoelastic method to deterimining whether the locations of rupture experimentally correlate with those predicted numerically new endovascular devices are being developed that are able to treat more complex and tortuous anatomies


 prevention and treatment 
an animal study showed that removing a single protein prevents early damage in blood vessels from triggering a later-stage complications by eliminating the gene for a signaling protein called cyclophilin a cypa from a strain of mice researchers were able to provide complete protection against abdominal aortic aneurysm
other recent research identified granzyme b gzmb a protein-degrading enzyme to be a potential target in the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms elimination of this enzyme in mice models both slowed the progression of aneurysms and improved survival
