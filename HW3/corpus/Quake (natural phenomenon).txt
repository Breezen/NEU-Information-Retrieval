a quake is the result when the surface of a planet moon or star begins to shake usually as the consequence of a sudden release of energy transmitted as seismic waves and potentially with great violence
the types of quakes include


 earthquake 

an earthquake is a phenomenon that results from the sudden release of stored energy in the earths crust that creates seismic waves at the earths surface earthquakes may manifest themselves by a shaking or displacement of the ground and sometimes cause tsunamis which may lead to loss of life and destruction of property an earthquake is caused by tectonic plates sections of the earths crust getting stuck and putting a strain on the ground the strain becomes so great that rocks give way and fault lines occur


 moonquake 

a moonquake is the lunar equivalent of an earthquake ie a quake on the moon they were first discovered by the apollo astronauts the largest moonquakes are much weaker than the largest earthquakes though they can last for up to an hour due to the lack of water to dampen seismic vibrations
information about moonquakes comes from seismometers placed on the moon by apollo astronauts from 1969 through 1972 the instruments placed by the apollo 12 14 15 and 16 functioned perfectly until they were switched off in 1977
according to nasa there are at least four different kinds of moonquakes
deep moonquakes 700 km below the surface probably tidal in origin
meteorite impact vibrations
thermal moonquakes the frigid lunar crust expands when sunlight returns after the two-week lunar night
shallow moonquakes 20 or 30 kilometers below the surface
the first three kinds of moonquakes mentioned above tend to be mild however shallow moonquakes can register up to 5.5 on the richter scale between 1972 and 1977 28 shallow moonquakes were observed on earth quakes of magnitude 4.5 and above can cause damage to buildings and other rigid structures


 marsquake 
a marsquake is a quake that occurs on the planet mars a recent study suggests that marsquakes occur every million years this suggestion is related to recently found evidence of marss tectonic boundaries


 venusquake 
a venusquake is a quake that occurs on the planet venus
a venusquake may have caused a new scarp and a landslide to form an image of the landslides was taken in november 1990 during the first flight around venus by the magellan spacecraft another image was taken on july 23 1991 as the magellan revolved around venus for the second time each image was 24 kilometres 15 mi across and 38 kilometres 24 mi long and was centered at 2° south latitude and 74° east longitude the pair of magellan images shows a region in aphrodite terra within a steeply sloping valley that is cut by many fractures faults


 planetquake 
planetquake is the generic term for quakes occurring on terrestrial planets since current observational technology cannot penetrate to the solid core of gaseous planets


 sunquake 

a sunquake is a quake that occurs on the sun
seismic waves produced by sunquakes occur in the photosphere and can travel at velocities of 35,000 kilometres per hour 22,000 mph for distances up to 400,000 kilometres 250,000 mi before fading away
on july 9 1996 a sunquake was produced by an x2.6 class solar flare and its corresponding coronal mass ejection according to researchers who reported the event in nature this sunquake was comparable to an earthquake of a magnitude 11.3 on the richter scale that represents a release of energy approximately 40,000 times greater than that of the devastating 1906 san francisco earthquake and far greater than that of any earthquake ever recorded such an event contains the energy of 100-110 billion tons of tnt or 2 million modest sized nuclear bombs it is unclear how such a relatively modest flare could have liberated sufficient energy to generate such powerful seismic waves
the esa and nasa spacecraft soho records sunquakes as part of its mission to study the sun


 starquake 

a starquake is an astrophysical phenomenon that occurs when the crust of a neutron star undergoes a sudden adjustment analogous to an earthquake on earth starquakes are thought to result from two different mechanisms one is the huge stresses exerted on the surface of the neutron star produced by twists in the ultra-strong interior magnetic fields a second cause is a result of spindown as the neutron star loses angular velocity due to frame-dragging and by the bleeding off of energy due to it being a rotating magnetic dipole the crust develops an enormous amount of stress once that exceeds a certain amount the shape adjusts itself to a shape closer to non-rotating equilibrium a perfect sphere the actual change is believed to be on the order of micrometers or less and occurs in less than a millionth of a second
the largest recorded starquake was detected on december 27 2004 from the ultracompact stellar corpse magnetar sgr 1806-20 which created a quake equivalent to a magnitude 32 the quake which occurred 50,000 light years from earth released gamma rays equivalent to 1037 kw in intensity had it occurred within a distance of 10 light years from earth the quake would have possibly triggered a mass extinction
