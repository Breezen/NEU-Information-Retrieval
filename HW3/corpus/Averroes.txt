 biography 


 early life and education 
muhammad ibn ahmad ibn muhammad ibn rushd was born in 1126 in córdoba to a family with a long and well-respected tradition of legal and public service his grandfather abu al-walid muhammad d 1126 was the chief judge qadi of córdoba as well as the imam of the great mosque of córdoba under the almoravids his father abu al-qasim ahmad was not as celebrated as his grandfather but was also qadi until the almoravids were replaced by the almohads in 1146
ibn rushds education was according to his traditional biographers excellent beginning with studies in hadith traditions of prophet muhammad fiqh jurisprudence medicine and theology he learned maliki jurisprudence under al-hafiz abu muhammad ibn rizq and hadith with ibn bashkuwal a student of his grandfather he studied medicine from abu jafar jarim al-tajail who probably taught him philosophy too he also knew the works of the philosopher ibn bajjah also known as avempace and might have known him personally or been tutored by him he also studied the kalam theology of the ashari school which he would criticize later in life his 13th century biographer ibn al-abbar mentioned that he was more interested in the study of law and its principles usul that that of hadith and he was especially competent in the field of khilaf disputes and controversies in the islamic jurisprudence ibn al-abbar also mentioned his interests in the sciences of the ancients probably in reference to greek philosophy and sciences


 career 
by 1153 he was in marrakesh in present-day morocco the capital of the almohad caliphate to perform astronomical observations in order to find physical laws of astronomical movements instead of just mathematical laws known at the time but this research was unsuccessful during his stay in marrakesh he likely met ibn tufayl a renowned philosopher and the author of hayy ibn yaqdhan ibn tufail introduced him to the court and to ibn zuhr avenzoar to the west the great muslim physician who became ibn rushds teacher and friend ibn rushds aptitude for medicine was noted by his contemporaries and can be seen in his major enduring work kitab al-kulyat fi al-tibb generalities influenced by the kitab al-taisir fi al-mudawat wa al-tadbir particularities of ibn zuhr ibn rushd later reported how it was also ibn tufail that inspired him to write his famous commentaries on aristotle

abu bakr ibn tufayl summoned me one day and told me that he had heard the commander of the faithful complaining about the disjointedness of aristotles mode of expression—or that of the translators—and the resultant obscurity of his intentions he said that if someone took on these books who could summarize them and clarify their aims after first thoroughly understanding them himself people would have an easier time comprehending them if you have the energy  ibn tufayl told me you do it im confident you can because i know what a good mind and devoted character you have and how dedicated you are to the art you understand that only my great age the cares of my office—and my commitment to another task that i think even more vital—keep me from doing it myself 

ibn rushd also studied the works and philosophy of ibn bajjah avempace to the west another famous islamic philosopher who greatly influenced his own averroist thought
however while the thought of his mentors ibn tufail and ibn bajjah were mystic to an extent the thought of ibn rushd was purely rationalist together the three men are considered the greatest andalusian philosophers ibn rushd devoted the next 30 years to his philosophical writings
in 1160 ibn rushd was made qadi judge of seville and he served in many court appointments in seville cordoba and morocco during his career sometime during the reign of yaqub al-mansur ibn rushds political career was abruptly ended and he faced severe criticism from the fuqaha islamic jurists of the time
a contemporary of ibn rushd abdelwahid al-marrakushi writing in 1224 reported that there were secret and public reasons for his falling out of favor with yaqub al-mansour

and in his days yaqub al-mansur abu al-walid ibn rushd faced his severe ordeal and there were two causes for this one is known and the other is secret the secret cause which was the major reason is that abu al-walid—may god have mercy on his soul—when summarizing commenting and expending upon aristotles book history of animals wrote and i saw the giraffe at the garden of the king of the berbers
and that is the same way he would mention another king of some other people or land as it is frequently done by writers but he omitted that those working for the service of the king should glorify him and observe the usual protocol this was why they held a grudge against him but initially they did not show it and in reality abu al-walid wrote that inadvertently  then a number of his enemies in cordoba who were jealous of him and were competing with him both in knowledge and nobility went to yaqub al-mansur with excerpts of abu walids work on some old philosophers which were in his own handwriting they took one phrase out of context that said and it was shown that venus is one of the gods and presented it to the king who then summoned the chiefs and noblemen of córdoba and said to abu al-walid in front of them is this your handwriting abu al-walid then denied and the king said may god curse the one who wrote this and ordered that abu al-walid be exiled and all the philosophy books to be gathered and burned  and i saw when i was in fes these books being carried on horses in great quantities and burned

ibn rushds strictly rationalist views collided with the more orthodox views of abu yusuf yaqub al-mansur who therefore eventually banished ibn rushd in 1195 and ordered his writings burned though he had previously appointed him as his personal physician ibn rushd was not allowed to return to marrakesh until 1197 shortly before his death in the year 1198 ad his body was returned to córdoba for burial


 works 

ibn rushds first writings date from his age of 31 year 1157 his works were spread over 20,000 pages covering a variety of different subjects including early islamic philosophy logic in islamic philosophy islamic medicine mathematics astronomy arabic grammar islamic theology sharia islamic law and fiqh islamic jurisprudence in particular his most important works dealt with islamic philosophy medicine and fiqh he wrote at least 80 original works which included 28 works on philosophy 20 on medicine 8 on law 5 on theology and 4 on grammar in addition to his commentaries on most of aristotles works and his commentary on platos the republic
ibn rushd commentaries on aristotle were the foundation for the aristotelian revival in the 12th and 13th centuries ibn rushd wrote short commentaries on aristotles work in logic physics and psychology ibn rushd long commentaries provided an in depth line by line analysis of aristotles posterior analytics de anima physics de caelo and the metaphysics
his most important original philosophical work was the incoherence of the incoherence tahafut al-tahafut in which he defended aristotelian philosophy against al-ghazalis claims in the incoherence of the philosophers tahafut al-falasifa
in fasl al-maqal fi ma bayn al-hikma wa al-shariah min ittisal فصل المقال في ما بين الحكمة و الشريعة من إتصال translated as the harmony of religion and philosophy or the decisive treatise determining the nature of the connection between religion and philosophy ibn rushd argues that philosophy and revelation do not contradict each other and are essentially different means of reaching the same truth however he warns against teaching philosophical methods to the general populace
other works include kitab al-kashf an manahij al-adilla كتاب الكشف عن مناهج الادلة 
ibn rushd is also a highly regarded legal scholar of the maliki school perhaps his best-known work in this field is bidāyat al-mujtahid wa nihāyat al-muqtaṣid  بداية المجتهد و نهاية المقتصد a textbook of maliki doctrine in a comparative framework
jacob anatoli translated several of the works of ibn rushd from arabic into hebrew in the 13th century many of them were later translated from hebrew into latin by jacob mantino and abraham de balmes other works were translated directly from arabic into latin by michael scot many of his works in logic and metaphysics have been permanently lost while others including some of the longer aristotelian commentaries have only survived in latin or hebrew translation not in the original arabic the fullest version of his works is in latin and forms part of the multi-volume juntine edition of aristotle published in venice 1562–1574


 commentaries on aristotle and plato 

ibn rushd wrote commentaries on most of the surviving works of aristotle working from arabic translations he wrote three types of commentaries the short commentary jami is generally an epitome the middle commentary talkhis is a paraphrase the long commentary tafsir includes the whole text with a detailed analysis of each line
not having access to aristotles politics ibn rushd substituted against platos republic he advances an authoritarian ideal following platos paternalistic model absolute monarchy led by a philosopher-king creates a justly ordered society this requires extensive use of coercion although persuasion is preferred and is possible if the young are properly raised rhetoric not logic is the appropriate road to truth for the common man demonstrative knowledge via philosophy and logic requires special study rhetoric aids religion in reaching the masses
following plato ibn rushd accepts the principle of womens equality they should be educated and allowed to serve in the military the best among them might be tomorrows philosophers or rulers he also accepts platos illiberal measures such as the censorship of literature he uses examples from arab history to illustrate just and degenerate political orders


 medicine 

ibn rushd wrote a medical encyclopedia called kulliyat generalities i e general medicine known in its latin translation as colliget he also made a compilation of the works of galen and wrote a commentary on the canon of medicine al-qanun fi t-tibb of avicenna ibn sina 980–1037


 physics 
ibn rushd also authored three books on physics namely short commentary on the physics middle commentary on the physics and long commentary on the physics ibn rushd defined and measured force as the rate at which work is done in changing the kinetic condition of a material body and correctly argued that the effect and measure of force is change in the kinetic condition of a materially resistant mass he took a particular and keen interest in the understanding of motor force
ibn rushd also developed the notion that bodies have a non-gravitational inherent resistance to motion into physics this idea in particular was adopted by thomas aquinas and subsequently by johannes kepler who referred to this fact as inertia
in optics ibn rushd followed alhazens incorrect explanation that a rainbow is due to reflection not refraction


 astronomy 
regarding his studies in astronomy ibn rushd argued for a strictly concentric model of the universe and explained sunspots and scientific reasoning regarding the occasional opaque colors of the moon he also worked on the description of the spheres and movement of the spheres


 psychology 
ibn rushd also made some studies regarding active intellect and passive intellect both of the following were formerly regarded subjects of psychology


 jurisprudence and law 
ibn rushd is also a highly regarded legal scholar of the maliki school perhaps his best-known work in this field is bidāyat al-mujtahid wa nihāyat al-muqtaṣid a textbook of maliki doctrine in a comparative framework which is rendered in english as the distinguished jurists primer he is also the author of al-bayān wal-taḥṣīl wal-sharḥ wal-tawjīh wal-talīl fi masāil al-mustakhraja a long and detailed commentary based on the mustakhraja of muḥammad al-utbī al-qurtubī


 philosophical ideas 


 the tradition of islamic philosophy 
ibn rushd furthered the tradition of greek philosophy in the islamic world falsafa his commentaries removed the neo-platonic bias of his predecessors criticizing al-farabis attempt to merge plato and aristotles ideas ibn rushd argued that aristotles philosophy diverged in significant ways from platos ibn rushd rejected avicennas neoplatonism which was partly based on the works of neo-platonic philosophers plotinus and proclus which were mistakenly attributed to aristotle
in metaphysics or more exactly ontology ibn rushd rejects the view advanced by avicenna that existence is merely accidental avicenna holds that essence is ontologically prior to existence the accidental are attributes which are not essential but rather are additional contingent characteristics ibn rushd following aristotle holds that individual existing substances are primary one may separate them mentally however ontologically speaking existence and essence are one according to fakhry this represents a change from platos theory of ideas where ideas precede particulars to aristotles theory where particulars come first and the essence is arrived at by a process of abstraction


 reconciliation of religion and philosophy 
his most important original philosophical work was the incoherence of the incoherence tahafut al-tahafut in which he defended aristotelian philosophy against al-ghazalis ad 1058–1111 claims in the incoherence of the philosophers tahafut al-falasifa al-ghazali had argued that aristotelianism especially as presented in the writings of avicenna was self-contradictory and an affront to the teachings of islam in particular he argued that three philosophical points viz a pre-eternal world god only knowing universal—that is to say platonic—characteristics of particulars and a spiritual rather than physical resurrection constituted not just heresy but rather disbelief in islam itself ibn rushds rebuttal was two-pronged first he contended that al-ghazalis arguments were mistaken arguing that the quran actually commanded devout muslims to study of philosophy second ibn rushd contended that he actually agreed with al-ghazali in regards to a number of the latters criticisms of avicenna ibn rushd argued that the system of avicenna was a distortion of genuine aristotelianism and as a result al-ghazali was effectively aiming at the wrong target ibn rushd thus argues that his own system is as roger arnaldez notes a reconstruction of the true philosophy that of aristotle himself against the false that of the neo-platonic falāsifa which distorted the thinking of aristotle
whereas al-ghazali believed that phenomenon such as cotton burning when coming into contact with fire happened each and every time only because god willed it to happen all earthly occurrences depend on heavenly occurrences ibn rushd by contrast insisted while god created the natural law humans could more usefully say that fire cause cotton to burn—because creation had a pattern that they could discern
in fasl al-maqal decisive treatise ibn rushd argues for the legality of philosophical investigation under islamic law and that there is no inherent contradiction between philosophy and religion
in kitab al-kashf which argued against the proofs of islam advanced by the asharite school and discussed what proofs on the popular level should be used instead


 nature of god 
in the treatise al-kashf an manahij al-adilla fi ‘aqaid al-milla the exposition of the methods of proof concerning the beliefs of the community ibn rushd examined and critiqued the doctrines of four sects of islam the asharites mutazilites the sufis and the those whom he deems literalists while his work focuses on many topics part of it examines the various sects proofs for the existence of god many of which ibn rushd finds objectionable after considering and critiquing the various argument he argues that there are only two arguments that are worth upholding the arguments from providence and invention the first argument considers the fact that the world and the universe seem fine-tuned to support human life according to ibn rushd given the fact that the universe seems to have been made just for humans this suggests a creator who set the parameters of the universe in the first place the second argument also known as the teleological argument contends that everything in the world appears as if it were invented this leads to the conclusion that there is a designer behind creation
in his philosophical treatises ibn rushd affirms the doctrine of divine unity ibn rushd also argues that god has seven divine attributes knowledge life power will hearing vision and speech in regards to the first the philosopher argued that god being the cause of the universe has knowledge based on being its cause while humans have knowledge based on the effects of such causes thus human knowledge and divine knowledge while related are different attributes given that life necessarily results from the natural world and god is the creator of said world ibn rushd thus contends that life is by necessity the second attribute of the divine the attributes of will and power are essential aspects of what it means to be god and given that god exists per the arguments given in the above paragraph ibn rushd logically concludes that he must also have these attributes by definition as to speech ibn rushd argues that knowledge and power inevitably give rise to speech and given that god has the first two he thus has the third finally in regards to vision and speech ibn rushd points out that because god created the world he necessarily knows every part of it just like an artist that understands their work intimately given that two elements of the world are the visual and the auditory god must necessarily possess the vision and speech


 eternity of the world 
ibn rushd looked to aristotle as to whether the world was eternal in his physics the greek philosopher argues that everything that comes into existence does so from a substratum therefore if the underlying matter of the universe came into existence it would come into existence from a substratum but the nature of matter is precisely to be the substratum from which other things arise consequently the underlying matter of the universe could have come into evidence only from an already existing matter exactly like itself to assume that the underlying matter of the universe came into existence would require assuming that an underlying matter already existed as this assumption is self-contradictory aristotle argued matter must be eternal because in his eyes aristotle demonstrated the eternity of matter ibn rushd abandoned belief in the creation out of nothing
this is not to say that ibn rushd denied the creation rather he proposed an eternal creation oliver leaman explains ibn rushds argument as such

we as humans can decide to do something we can wait for a certain time before acting we can wonder about our future actions but such possibilities cannot arise for an eternal omnipotent omnipresent god in his case there is no gap between desire and action nothing stands in the way of his activity and yet we are told by al-ghazali that god suddenly created the world what differentiates one time from another for god what could motivate him to create the world at one particular time as opposed to another for us different times are different because they have different qualitative aspects yet before the creation of the world when there was nothing around to characterize one time as distinct from another there is nothing to characterize one time over another as the time for creation to take place


 significance 

ibn rushd is most famous for his commentaries of aristotles works which had been mostly forgotten in the west before 1150 only a few of aristotles works existed in translation in latin europe although the tradition of great philosophers and poets of antiquity continued to be studied and copied in the greek byzantium it was to some degree through the latin translations of ibn rushds work beginning in the thirteenth century that the legacy of aristotle was recovered in the latin west
ibn rushds work on aristotle spans almost three decades and he wrote commentaries on almost all of aristotles work except for aristotles politics to which he did not have access hebrew translations of his work also had a lasting impact on jewish philosophy moses maimonides samuel ben tibbon juda ben solomon choen and shem tob ben joseph falaquera were jewish philosophers influenced by ibn rushd in regards to muslim philosophy in his work fasl al-maqāl often translated into english as the decisive treatise he stresses the importance of analytical thinking as a prerequisite to interpret the quran however because his death coincided with a change in the culture of al-andalus ibn rushd had no major influence on islamic philosophic thought until modern times those islamic philosophers who did comment on his work often condemned his writings as unorthodox
in the christian west ibn rushds ideas were assimilated by siger of brabant and thomas aquinas and others especially those from the university of paris who situated themselves in the christian scholastic tradition which valued aristotelian logic with that said famous scholastics such as aquinas did not refer to ibn rushd by name instead choosing to refer to him simply as the commentator with aristotle in turn being given the sobriquet the philosopher ultimately ibn rushd received a mixed reception from christian europe while he was regarded fairly highly for his detailed commentaries on the works of aristotle his person philosophy—which came to be known as averroism—was criticized for not being compatible with christian doctrine the catholic encyclopedia for instance notes

his doctrines had a varying fortune in christian schools at first they secured a certain amount of adherence then gradually their incompatibility with christian teaching became apparent and finally owing to the revolt of the renaissance from everything scholastic they secured once more a temporary hearing his commentaries however had immediate and lasting success st thomas aquinas used the grand commentary of averroes as his model being apparently the first scholastic to adopt that style of exposition  he always spoke of the arabian commentator as one who had in his view perverted the peripatetic tradition but whose words nevertheless should be treated with respect and consideration

indeed aquinas considered ibn rushd to be the premiere commentator on aristotle but he disagreed with his religious and theological arguments in regards to this point norman kretzmann argues that through the use of the title the commentator aquinas was able to convey ibn rushds understanding of aristotle without having to accept or condone ibn rushds personal understanding of philosophy


 legacy 
reflecting the deference that some medieval european scholars paid to him ibn rushd is named by dante in the divine comedy along with the thinkers and creative minds of ancient greece and rome whose spirits dwell in the place that favor owes to fame in limbo
ibn rushd appears in a short story by jorge luis borges entitled averroess search in which he is portrayed trying to find the meanings of the words tragedy and comedy he is briefly mentioned in the novel ulysses by james joyce alongside maimonides he appears to be waiting outside the walls of the ancient city of cordoba in alamgir hashmis poem in cordoba
the claim that ibn rushd deserves equal respect with maimonides got the fictional balthazar abrabanel banished from amsterdam by the amsterdam rabbinate in eric flints novel 1634
ibn rushd is the title of a play called the gladius and the rose written by tunisian writer mohamed ghozzi and which took first prize in the theater festival in charjah in 1999
in his memoir the british indian novelist salman rushdie recalls that his father adopted the family name rushdie in honour of ibn rushd who also appears as a character in rushdies novel two years eight months and twenty-eight nights
