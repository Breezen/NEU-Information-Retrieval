a micrometeorite is essentially a micrometeoroid that has survived entry through earths atmosphere the size of such a particle ranges from 50 μm to 2 mm usually found on earths surface micrometeorites differ from meteorites in that they are smaller in size more abundant and different in composition they are a subset of cosmic dust which also includes the smaller interplanetary dust particles idps
micrometeorites enter earths atmosphere at high velocities at least 11 kms and undergo heating through atmospheric friction and compression micrometeorites individually weigh between 10−9 and 10−4 g and collectively comprise most of the extraterrestrial material that has come to the present-day earth
fred lawrence whipple first coined the term micro-meteorite to describe dust-sized objects that fall to the earth sometimes meteoroids and micrometeoroids entering the earths atmosphere are visible as meteors or shooting stars whether or not they reach the ground and survive as meteorites and micrometorites


 introduction 
micrometeorite mm textures vary as their original structural and mineral compositions are modified by the degree of heating that they experience entering the atmosphere—a function of their initial speed and angle of entry they range from unmelted particles that retain their original mineralogy fig 1 a b to partially melted particles fig 1 c d to round melted cosmic spherules fig 1 e f g h fig 2 some of which have lost a large portion of their mass through vaporization fig 1 i classification is based on composition and degree of heating

the extraterrestrial origins of micrometeorites are determined by microanalyses that show that
the metal they contain is similar to that found in meteorites
some have wüstite a high-temperature iron oxide found in meteorite fusion crusts
their silicate minerals have major and trace elements ratios similar to those in meteorites
the abundances of cosmogenic manganese 53mn in iron spherules and of cosmogenic beryllium 10be aluminum 26al and solar neon isotope in stony mms are extraterrestrial
the presence of pre-solar grains in some mms and deuterium excesses in ultra-carbonaceous mms indicates that they are not only extraterrestrial but that some of their components formed before our solar system
an estimated 30,000 ± 20,000 tonnes per year tyr of cosmic dust enters the upper atmosphere each year of which less than 10% 2700 ± 1400 tyr is estimated to reach the surface as particles therefore the mass of micrometeorites deposited is roughly 50 times higher than that estimated for meteorites which represent approximately 50 tyr and the huge number of particles entering the atmosphere each year 1017  10 μm suggests that large mm collections contain particles from all dust producing objects in the solar system including asteroids comets and fragments from our moon and mars large mm collections provide information on the size composition atmospheric heating effects and types of materials accreting on earth while detailed studies of individual mms give insights into their origin the nature of the carbon amino acids and pre-solar grains they contain


 collection sites 
micrometeorites have been collected from deep-sea sediments sedimentary rocks and polar sediments they are currently collected primarily from polar snow and ice because of their low concentrations on the earths surface mms are sought in environments that concentrate these materials relative to terrestrial particles


 ocean sediments 
melted micrometeorites cosmic spherules were first collected from deep-sea sediments during the 1873 to 1876 expedition of the hms challenger in 1891 murray and renard found two groups of micrometeorites first black magnetic spherules with or without a metallic nucleus second brown-coloured spherules resembling chondrules with a crystalline structure in 1883 they suggested that these spherules were extraterrestrial because they were found far from terrestrial particle sources they did not resemble magnetic spheres produced in furnaces of the time and their nickel-iron fe-ni metal cores did not resemble metallic iron found in volcanic rocks the spherules were most abundant in slowly accumulating sediments particularly red clays deposited below the carbonate compensation depth a finding that supported a meteoritic origin in addition to those spheres with fe-ni metal cores some spherules larger than 300 μm contain a core of elements from the platinum group
since the first collection of the hms challenger cosmic spherules have been recovered from ocean sediments using cores box cores clamshell grabbers and magnetic sleds among these a magnetic sled called the cosmic muck rake retrieved thousands of cosmic spherules from the top 10 cm of red clays on the pacific ocean floor


 terrestrial sediments 
terrestrial sediments also contain micrometeorites these have been found in samples that
have low sedimentation rates such as claystones and hardgrounds
are easily dissolved such as salt deposits and limestones
have been mass sorted such as heavy mineral concentrates found in deserts and beach sands
the oldest mms are totally altered iron spherules found in 140- to 180-million-year-old hardgrounds
amateur collectors may find micrometeorites in areas where dirt and dust from a large area has been concentrated such as from a roof downspout


 polar depositions 

micrometeorites found in polar sediments are much less weathered than those found in other terrestrial environments as evidenced by little etching of interstitial glass and the presence of large numbers of glass spherules and unmelted micrometeorites particle types that are rare or absent in deep-sea samples the mms found in polar regions have been collected from greenland snow greenland cryoconite antarctic blue ice antarctic aeolian wind-driven debris ice cores the bottom of the south pole water well antarctic sediment traps and present day antarctic snow


 classification and origins of micrometeorites 


 classification 
modern classification of meteorites and micrometeorites is complex the 2007 review paper of krot et al summarizes modern meteorite taxonomy linking individual micrometeorites to meteorite classification groups requires a comparison of their elemental isotopic and textural characteristics


 comet vs asteroid origin of micrometeorites 
whereas most meteorites likely originate from asteroids the contrasting makeup of micrometeorites suggests that most originate from comets
fewer than 1% of mms are achondritic and are similar to hed meteorites which are thought to be from the asteroid 4 vesta most mms are compositionally similar to carbonaceous chondrites whereas approximately 3% of meteorites are of this type the dominance of carbonaceous chondrite-like mms and their low abundance in meteorite collections suggests that most mms derive from sources different than those for most meteorites since most meteorites probably derive from asteroids an alternative source for mms might be comets the idea that mms might originate from comets originated in 1950
until recently the greater-than-25-kms entry velocities of micrometeoroids measured for particles from comet streams cast doubts against their survival as mms however recent dynamical simulations suggest that 85% of cosmic dust could be cometary furthermore analyses of particles returned from the comet wild 2 by the stardust spacecraft show that these particles have compositions that are consistent with many micrometeorites nonetheless some parent bodies of micrometeorites appear to be asteroids with chondrule-bearing carbonaceous chondrites


 extraterrestrial micrometeorites 
the influx of micrometeoroids also contributes to the composition of regolith planetarylunar soil on other bodies in the solar system mars has an estimated annual micrometeoroid influx of between 2,700 and 59,000 tyr this contributes to about 1m of micrometeoritic content to the depth of the martian regolith every billion years measurements from the viking program indicate that the martian regolith is composed of 60% basaltic rock and 40% rock of meteoritic origin the lower-density martian atmosphere allows much larger particles than on earth to survive the passage through to the surface largely unaltered until impact while on earth particles that survive entry typically have undergone significant transformation a significant fraction of particles entering the martian atmosphere throughout the 60 to 1200-μm diameter range probably survive unmelted
