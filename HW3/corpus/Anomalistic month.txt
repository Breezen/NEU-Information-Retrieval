in lunar calendars a lunar month is the time between two successive syzygies new moons or full moons the use of the lunar month varies by which culture has utilized the method the main difference being when the new month begins
this article deals with the definitions of a month that are mainly of significance in astronomy for other definitions including a description of a month in the calendars of different cultures around the world see month


 variations 
in shona middle-eastern and european traditions the month starts when the young crescent moon becomes first visible at evening after conjunction with the sun one or two days before that evening eg in the islamic calendar in ancient egypt the lunar month began on the day when the waning moon could no longer be seen just before sunrise others use calculation of varying degrees of sophistication eg the hebrew calendar or the ecclesiastical lunar calendar yet others run from full moon to full moon calendars count integer days so months may be 29 or 30 days in length in some regular or irregular sequence in india the month from conjunction to conjunction is divided into thirty parts known as tithis the date is named after the tithi ruling at sunrise as the tithi is shorter than the day the date sometimes jumps
in common law a lunar month traditionally meant exactly 28 days or four weeks thus a contact for 12 months ran for exactly 48 weeks in the united kingdom the lunar month was formally replaced by the calendar month for deeds and other written contracts by the law of property act 1925 and for all other legal purposes by the interpretation act 1978


 terminology 
there are several types of lunar month the term lunar month usually refers to the synodic month because it is the cycle of the visible phases of the moon
most of the following types of lunar month except the distinction between the sidereal and tropical months were first recognized in babylonian lunar astronomy


 sidereal month 
the period of the moons orbit as defined with respect to the celestial sphere of apparently fixed stars nowadays the international celestial reference frame icrf is known as a sidereal month because it is the time it takes the moon to return to a similar position among the stars latin sidera 27.321661 days 27 d 7 h 43 min 11.6 s this type of month has been observed among cultures in the middle east india and china in the following way they divided the sky into 27 or 28 lunar mansions one for each day of the month identified by the prominent stars in them


 synodic month 
the synodic month greek συνοδικόσ sunodikos meaning pertaining to a synod ie a meeting in this case of the sun and the moon is the average period of the moons orbit with respect to the line joining the sun and earth this is the period of the lunar phases because the moons appearance depends on the position of the moon with respect to the sun as seen from the earth
while the moon is orbiting the earth the earth is progressing in its orbit around the sun after completing a sidereal month the moon must move a little further to reach the new position having the same angular distance from the sun appearing to move with respect to the stars since the previous month therefore the synodic month takes 2.2 days longer than the sidereal month thus about 13.37 sidereal months but about 12.37 synodic months occur in a gregorian year
since earths orbit around the sun is elliptical and not circular the speed of earths progression around the sun varies during the year thus the angular rate is faster nearer periapsis and slower near apoapsis the same is so for the moons orbit around the earth because of these variations in angular rate the actual time between lunations may vary from about 29.18 to about 29.93 days the long-term average duration is 29.530587981 days 29 d 12 h 44 min 2.8016 s the synodic month is used to calculate eclipse cycles


 tropical month 
it is customary to specify positions of celestial bodies with respect to the vernal equinox because of earths precession of the equinoxes this point moves back slowly along the ecliptic therefore it takes the moon less time to return to an ecliptic longitude of 0° than to the same point amid the fixed stars 27.321582 days 27 d 7 h 43 min 4.7 s this slightly shorter period is known as tropical month cf the analogous tropical year


 anomalistic month 

the moons orbit approximates an ellipse rather than a circle however the orientation as well as the shape of this orbit is not fixed in particular the position of the extreme points the line of the apsides perigee and apogee rotates once apsidal precession in about 3,233 days 8.85 years it takes the moon longer to return to the same apsis because it has moved ahead during one revolution this longer period is called the anomalistic month and has an average length of 27.554551 days 27 d 13 h 18 min 33.2 s the apparent diameter of the moon varies with this period so this type has some relevance for the prediction of eclipses see saros whose extent duration and appearance whether total or annular depend on the exact apparent diameter of the moon the apparent diameter of the full moon varies with the full moon cycle which is the beat period of the synodic and anomalistic month as well as the period after which the apsides point to the sun again
an anomalistic month is longer than a sidereal month because the perigee moves in the same direction as the moon is orbiting the earth one revolution in nine years therefore the moon takes a little longer to return to perigee than to return to the same star


 draconic month 

a draconic month is sometimes also known as a draconitic month or nodical month the name draconic refers to a mythical dragon said to live in the lunar nodes and eat the sun or moon during an eclipse a solar or lunar eclipse is possible only when the moon is at or near either of the two points where its orbit crosses the ecliptic plane ie the satellite is at or near either of its orbital nodes
the orbit of the moon lies in a plane that is inclined about 5.14° with respect to the ecliptic plane the line of intersection of these planes passes through the two points at which the moons orbit crosses the ecliptic plane the ascending node where the moon enters the northern celestial hemisphere and the descending node where the moon moves into the southern
the draconic or nodical month is the average interval between two successive transits of the moon through the same node because of the torque exerted by the suns gravity on the angular momentum of the earth–moon system the plane of the moons orbit gradually rotates westward which means the nodes gradually rotate around earth as a result the time it takes the moon to return to the same node is shorter than a sidereal month it lasts 27.212220 days 27 d 5 h 5 min 35.8 s the nodes of the moons orbit precesses 360° in about 6,798 days 18.6 years
a draconic month is shorter than a sidereal month because the nodes precess in the opposite direction to that in which the moon is orbiting earth one rotation every 18.6 years therefore the moon returns to the same node slightly earlier than it returns to the same star


 cycle lengths 
regardless of the culture all lunar months approximate the mean length of the synodic month the average period the moon takes to cycle through its phases new first quarter full last quarter and back again 29–30 days the moon completes one orbit around earth every 27.3 days a sidereal month but due to earths orbital motion around the sun the moon does not yet finish a synodic cycle until it has reached the point in its orbit where the sun is in the same relative position
this table lists the average lengths of five types of astronomical lunar month these are not constant so a first-order linear approximation of the secular change is provided
valid for the epoch j2000.0 1 january 2000 1200 tt
note in this table time is expressed in ephemeris time more precisely terrestrial time with days of 86,400 si seconds y is years since the epoch 2000 expressed in julian years of 365.25 days for calendric calculations one would probably use days measured in the time scale of universal time which follows the somewhat unpredictable rotation of the earth and progressively accumulates a difference with ephemeris time called δt
apart from the long term millennial drift in these values all these periods vary continually around their mean values because of the complex orbital effects of the sun and planets affecting its motion
