sparta doric greek σπάρτα spártā attic greek σπάρτη spártē was a prominent city-state in ancient greece in antiquity the city-state was known as lacedaemon λακεδαίμων lakedaímōn while the name sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the eurotas river in laconia in south-eastern peloponnese around 650 bc it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient greece
given its military pre-eminence sparta was recognized as the overall leader of the combined greek forces during the greco-persian wars between 431 and 404 bc sparta was the principal enemy of athens during the peloponnesian war from which it emerged victorious though at a great cost of lives lost spartas defeat by thebes in the battle of leuctra in 371 bc ended spartas prominent role in greece however it maintained its political independence until the roman conquest of greece in 146 bc it then underwent a long period of decline especially in the middle ages when many spartans moved to live in mystras modern sparta is the capital of the greek regional unit of laconia and a center for the processing of goods such as citrus and olives
sparta was unique in ancient greece for its social system and constitution which configured their entire society to maximize military proficiency at all costs and completely focused on military training and excellence its inhabitants were classified as spartiates spartan citizens who enjoyed full rights mothakes non-spartan free men raised as spartans perioikoi free residents literally dwellers around and helots state-owned serfs enslaved non-spartan local population spartiates underwent the rigorous agoge training and education regimen and spartan phalanges were widely considered to be among the best in battle spartan women enjoyed considerably more rights and equality to men than elsewhere in the classical antiquity
sparta was the subject of fascination in its own day as well as in western culture following the revival of classical learning this love or admiration of sparta is known as laconism or laconophilia at its peak around 500 bc the size of the city would have been some 20,000–35,000 citizens plus numerous helots and perioikoi the likely total of 40,000–50,000 made sparta one of the largest greek cities however according to thucydides the population of athens in 431 bc was 360,000–610,000 making it unlikely that athens was smaller than sparta in 5th century bc the french classicist françois ollier in his 1933 book le mirage spartiate the spartan mirage warned that a major scholarly problem regarding sparta is that all the surviving accounts were written by non-spartans who often presented an excessively idealized image of sparta olliers views have been widely accepted by scholars


 names 
the earliest attested term referring to lacedaemon is the mycenaean greek 𐀨𐀐𐀅𐀖𐀛𐀍 ra-ke-da-mi-ni-jo lacedaimonian written in linear b syllabic script being the equivalent of the written in the greek alphabet latter greek λακεδαιμόνιοσ lakedaimonios latin lacedaemonius

the ancient greeks used one of three words to refer to the home location of the spartans the first refers primarily to the main cluster of settlements in the valley of the eurotas river sparta the second word was lacedaemon λακεδαίμων this was also used sometimes as an adjective and is the name commonly used in the works of homer and the historians herodotus and thucydides herodotus seems to denote by it the mycenaean greek citadel at therapne in contrast to the lower town of sparta it could be used synonymously with sparta but typically it was not it denoted the terrain on which sparta was situated in homer it is typically combined with epithets of the countryside wide lovely shining and most often hollow and broken full of ravines the hollow suggests the eurotas valley sparta on the other hand is the country of lovely women a people epithet
the name of the population was often used for the state of lacedaemon the lacedaemonians this epithet utilized the plural of the adjective lacedaemonius greek λακεδαιμὀνιοι latin lacedaemonii but also lacedaemones if the ancients wished to refer to the country more directly instead of lacedaemon they could use a back-formation from the adjective lacedaemonian country as most words for country were feminine the adjective was in the feminine lacedaemonia λακεδαιμονία lakedaimonia eventually the adjective came to be used alone
lacedaemonia was not in general use during the classical period and before it does occur in greek as an equivalent of laconia and messenia during the roman and early byzantine periods mostly in ethnographers and lexica glossing place names for example hesychius of alexandrias lexicon 5th century ad defines agiadae as a place in lacedaemonia named after agis the actual transition may be captured by isidore of sevilles etymologiae 7th century ad an etymological dictionary he relied heavily on orosius historiarum adversum paganos 5th century ad and eusebius of caesareas chronicon early 5th century ad as did orosius the latter defines sparta to be lacedaemonia civitas but isidore defines lacedaemonia as founded by lacedaemon son of semele relying on eusebius there is a rare use perhaps the earliest of lacedaemonia in diodorus siculus but probably with χὠρα country suppressed
the immediate area around the town of sparta the plateau east of the taygetos mountains was generally referred as laconice λακωνική this term was sometimes used to refer to all the regions under direct spartan control including messenia
lakedaimona was until 2006 the name of a province in the modern greek prefecture of laconia


 geography 
sparta is located in the region of laconia in the south-eastern peloponnese ancient sparta was built on the banks of the eurotas river the main river of laconia which provided it with a source of fresh water the valley of the eurotas is a natural fortress bounded to the west by mt taygetus 2407 m and to the east by mt parnon 1935 m to the north laconia is separated from arcadia by hilly uplands reaching 1000 m in altitude these natural defenses worked to spartas advantage and contributed to sparta never having been sacked though landlocked sparta had a harbor gytheio on the laconian gulf


 mythology 
lacedaemon greek λακεδαίμων was a mythical king of laconia the son of zeus by the nymph taygete he married sparta the daughter of eurotas by whom he became the father of amyclas eurydice and asine he named the country after himself and the city after his wife he was believed to have built the sanctuary of the charites which stood between sparta and amyclae and to have given to those divinities the names of cleta and phaenna a shrine was erected to him in the neighborhood of therapne


 archaeology of the classical period 

thucydides wrote

suppose the city of sparta to be deserted and nothing left but the temples and the ground-plan distant ages would be very unwilling to believe that the power of the lacedaemonians was at all equal to their fame their city is not built continuously and has no splendid temples or other edifices it rather resembles a group of villages like the ancient towns of hellas and would therefore make a poor show

until the early 20th century the chief ancient buildings at sparta were the theatre of which however little showed above ground except portions of the retaining walls the so-called tomb of leonidas a quadrangular building perhaps a temple constructed of immense blocks of stone and containing two chambers the foundation of an ancient bridge over the eurotas the ruins of a circular structure some remains of late roman fortifications several brick buildings and mosaic pavements
the remaining archaeological wealth consisted of inscriptions sculptures and other objects collected in the local museum founded by stamatakis in 1872 and enlarged in 1907 partial excavation of the round building was undertaken in 1892 and 1893 by the american school at athens the structure has been since found to be a semicircular retaining wall of hellenic origin that was partly restored during the roman period

in 1904 the british school at athens began a thorough exploration of laconia and in the following year excavations were made at thalamae geronthrae and angelona near monemvasia in 1906 excavations began in sparta
a small circus described by leake proved to be a theatre-like building constructed soon after ad 200 around the altar and in front of the temple of artemis orthia here musical and gymnastic contests took place as well as the famous flogging ordeal diamastigosis the temple which can be dated to the 2nd century bc rests on the foundation of an older temple of the 6th century and close beside it were found the remains of a yet earlier temple dating from the 9th or even the 10th century the votive offerings in clay amber bronze ivory and lead found in great profusion within the precinct range dating from the 9th to the 4th centuries bc supply invaluable evidence for early spartan art
in 1907 the sanctuary of athena of the brazen house chalkioikos was located on the acropolis immediately above the theatre and though the actual temple is almost completely destroyed the site has produced the longest extant archaic inscription of laconia numerous bronze nails and plates and a considerable number of votive offerings the greek city-wall built in successive stages from the 4th to the 2nd century was traced for a great part of its circuit which measured 48 stades or nearly 10 km 6 miles polyb 1x 21 the late roman wall enclosing the acropolis part of which probably dates from the years following the gothic raid of ad 262 was also investigated besides the actual buildings discovered a number of points were situated and mapped in a general study of spartan topography based upon the description of pausanias


 menelaion 

the menelaion is a shrine associated with menelaus located east of sparta by the river eurotas on the hill profitis ilias coordinates 37.0659°n 22.4536°e﻿  37.0659 22.4536 built early 8th century bc it was believed by spartans to be the home of menelaus in 1970 the british school in athens started excavations in an attempt to locate mycenaean remains in the area around menelaion among other findings they uncovered the remains of two mycenaean mansions and found the first offerings dedicated to helen and menelaus these mansions were destroyed by earthquake and fire and archaeologists consider them the possible palace of menelaus himself excavations made from the early 1990s to the present suggest that the area around menelaion in the southern part of the eurotas valley seems to have been the center of mycenaean laconia the mycenaean settlement was roughly triangular in shape with its apex pointed towards the north its area was approximately equal to that of the newer sparta but denudation has wreaked havoc with its buildings and nothing is left save ruined foundations and broken potsherds


 history 


 prehistory dark age and archaic period 
the prehistory of sparta is difficult to reconstruct because the literary evidence is far removed in time from the events it describes and is also distorted by oral tradition however the earliest certain evidence of human settlement in the region of sparta consists of pottery dating from the middle neolithic period found in the vicinity of kouphovouno some two kilometres 1.2 miles south-southwest of sparta these are the earliest traces of the original mycenaean spartan civilisation as represented in homers iliad
this civilization seems to have fallen into decline by the late bronze age when according to herodotus macedonian tribes from the north called dorians by those they conquered marched into peloponnese and subjugating the local tribes settled there the dorians seem to have set about expanding the frontiers of spartan territory almost before they had established their own state they fought against the argive dorians to the east and southeast and also the arcadian achaeans to the northwest the evidence suggests that sparta relatively inaccessible because of the topography of the taygetan plain was secure from early on it was never fortified

nothing distinctive in the archaeology of the eurotas river valley identifies the dorians or the dorian spartan state the prehistory of the neolithic the bronze age and the dark age the early iron age at this moment must be treated apart from the stream of dorian spartan history
the legendary period of spartan history is believed to fall into the dark age it treats the mythic heroes such as the heraclids and the perseids offering a view of the occupation of the peloponnesus that contains both fantastic and possibly historical elements the subsequent proto-historic period combining both legend and historical fragments offers the first credible history
between the 8th and 7th centuries bc the spartans experienced a period of lawlessness and civil strife later attested by both herodotus and thucydides as a result they carried out a series of political and social reforms of their own society which they later attributed to a semi-mythical lawgiver lycurgus these reforms mark the beginning of the history of classical sparta


 classical sparta 
in the second messenian war sparta established itself as a local power in peloponnesus and the rest of greece during the following centuries spartas reputation as a land-fighting force was unequalled in 480 bc a small force of spartans thespians and thebans led by king leonidas approximately 300 were full spartiates 700 were thespians and 400 were thebans although these numbers do not reflect casualties incurred prior to the final battle made a legendary last stand at the battle of thermopylae against the massive persian army inflicting very high casualties on the persian forces before finally being encircled the superior weaponry strategy and bronze armour of the greek hoplites and their phalanx again proved their worth one year later when sparta assembled at full strength and led a greek alliance against the persians at the battle of plataea
the decisive greek victory at plataea put an end to the greco-persian war along with persian ambition of expanding into europe even though this war was won by a pan-greek army credit was given to sparta who besides being the protagonist at thermopylae and plataea had been the de facto leader of the entire greek expedition
in later classical times sparta along with athens thebes and persia had been the main powers fighting for supremacy against each other as a result of the peloponnesian war sparta a traditionally continental culture became a naval power at the peak of its power sparta subdued many of the key greek states and even managed to overpower the elite athenian navy by the end of the 5th century bc it stood out as a state which had defeated the athenian empire and had invaded the persian provinces in anatolia a period which marks the spartan hegemony
during the corinthian war sparta faced a coalition of the leading greek states thebes athens corinth and argos the alliance was initially backed by persia whose lands in anatolia had been invaded by sparta and which feared further spartan expansion into asia sparta achieved a series of land victories but many of her ships were destroyed at the battle of cnidus by a greek-phoenician mercenary fleet that persia had provided to athens the event severely damaged spartas naval power but did not end its aspirations of invading further into persia until conon the athenian ravaged the spartan coastline and provoked the old spartan fear of a helot revolt
after a few more years of fighting in 387 bc the peace of antalcidas was established according to which all greek cities of ionia would return to persian control and persias asian border would be free of the spartan threat the effects of the war were to reaffirm persias ability to interfere successfully in greek politics and to affirm spartas weakened hegemonic position in the greek political system sparta entered its long-term decline after a severe military defeat to epaminondas of thebes at the battle of leuctra this was the first time that a spartan army lost a land battle at full strength
as spartan citizenship was inherited by blood sparta now increasingly faced a helot population that vastly outnumbered its citizens the alarming decline of spartan citizens was commented on by aristotle


 hellenistic and roman sparta 
sparta never fully recovered from the losses that the spartans suffered at leuctra in 371 bc and the subsequent helot revolts nonetheless it was able to continue as a regional power for over two centuries neither philip ii nor his son alexander the great attempted to conquer sparta itself
even during its decline sparta never forgot its claim to be the defender of hellenism and its laconic wit an anecdote has it that when philip ii sent a message to sparta saying if i enter laconia i will raze sparta the spartans responded with the single terse reply αἴκα if
when philip created the league of the greeks on the pretext of unifying greece against persia the spartans chose not to join since they had no interest in joining a pan-greek expedition unless it were under spartan leadership thus upon the conquest of persia alexander the great sent to athens 300 suits of persian armour with the following inscription alexander son of philip and all the greeks except the spartans give these offerings taken from the foreigners who live in asia emphasis added
during alexanders campaigns in the east the spartan king agis iii sent a force to crete in 333 bc with the aim of securing the island for sparta agis next took command of allied greek forces against macedon gaining early successes before laying siege to megalopolis in 331 bc a large macedonian army under general antipater marched to its relief and defeated the spartan-led force in a pitched battle more than 5,300 of the spartans and their allies were killed in battle and 3,500 of antipaters troops agis now wounded and unable to stand ordered his men to leave him behind to face the advancing macedonian army so that he could buy them time to retreat on his knees the spartan king slew several enemy soldiers before being finally killed by a javelin alexander was merciful and he only forced the spartans to join the league of corinth which they had previously refused to join
during the punic wars sparta was an ally of the roman republic spartan political independence was put to an end when it was eventually forced into the achaean league after its defeat in the decisive laconian war by a coalition of other greek city-states and rome and the resultant overthrow of its final king nabis sparta played no active part in the achaean war in 146 bc when the achaean league was defeated by the roman general lucius mummius subsequently sparta become a free city in the roman sense some of the institutions of lycurgus were restored and the city became a tourist attraction for the roman elite who came to observe exotic spartan customs


 postclassical and modern sparta 
according to byzantine sources some parts of the laconian region remained pagan until well into the 10th century ad doric-speaking populations survive today in tsakonia in the middle ages the political and cultural center of laconia shifted to the nearby settlement of mystras and sparta fell further in even local importance modern sparti was re-founded in 1834 by a decree of king otto of greece


 structure of classical spartan society 


 constitution 

sparta was an oligarchy the state was ruled by two hereditary kings of the agiad and eurypontid families both supposedly descendants of heracles and equal in authority so that one could not act against the power and political enactments of his colleague
the duties of the kings were primarily religious judicial and military they were the chief priests of the state and also maintained communication with the delphian sanctuary which always exercised great authority in spartan politics in the time of herodotus about 450 bc their judicial functions had been restricted to cases dealing with heiresses adoptions and the public roads aristotle describes the kingship at sparta as a kind of unlimited and perpetual generalship pol iii i285a while isocrates refers to the spartans as subject to an oligarchy at home to a kingship on campaign iii 24
civil and criminal cases were decided by a group of officials known as the ephors as well as a council of elders known as the gerousia the gerousia consisted of 28 elders over the age of 60 elected for life and usually part of the royal households and the two kings high state policy decisions were discussed by this council who could then propose action alternatives to the damos the collective body of spartan citizenry who would select one of the alternatives by voting
the royal prerogatives were curtailed over time dating from the period of the persian wars the king lost the right to declare war and was accompanied in the field by two ephors he was supplanted also by the ephors in the control of foreign policy over time the kings became mere figureheads except in their capacity as generals real power was transferred to the ephors and to the gerousia
the origins of the powers exercised by the assembly of the citizens called the apella are virtually unknown because of the lack of historical documentation and spartan state secrecy


 citizenship 
not all inhabitants of the spartan state were considered to be citizens only those who had undertaken the spartan education process known as the agoge were eligible however usually the only people eligible to receive the agoge were spartiates or people who could trace their ancestry to the original inhabitants of the city
there were two exceptions trophimoi or foster sons were foreign students invited to study the athenian general xenophon for example sent his two sons to sparta as trophimoi the other exception was that the son of a helot could be enrolled as a syntrophos if a spartiate formally adopted him and paid his way if a syntrophos did exceptionally well in training he might be sponsored to become a spartiate spartans who could not afford to pay the expenses of the agoge could lose their citizenship
these laws meant that sparta could not readily replace citizens lost in battle or otherwise and eventually proved near fatal to the continuance of the state as the number of citizens became greatly outnumbered by the non-citizens and even more dangerously the helots


 non citizens 
others in the state were the perioikoi who were free inhabitants of spartan territory but were non-citizens and the helots the state-owned serfs descendants of non-spartan citizens were not able to follow the agoge


 helots 

the spartans were a minority of the lakonian population the largest class of inhabitants were the helots in classical greek εἵλωτεσ  heílôtes
the helots were originally free greeks from the areas of messenia and lakonia whom the spartans had defeated in battle and subsequently enslaved in contrast to populations conquered by other greek cities eg the athenian treatment of melos the male population was not exterminated and the women and children turned into chattel slaves instead the helots were given a subordinate position in society more comparable to serfs in medieval europe than chattel slaves in the rest of greece
helots did not have voting rights although compared to non-greek chattel slaves in other parts of greece they were relatively privileged the spartan poet tyrtaios refers to helots being allowed to marry and retaining 50% of the fruits of their labor they also seem to have been allowed to practice religious rites and according to thucydides own a limited amount of personal property some 6,000 helots accumulated enough wealth to buy their freedom for example in 227 bc
in other greek city-states free citizens were part-time soldiers who when not at war carried on other trades since spartan men were full-time soldiers they were not available to carry out manual labour the helots were used as unskilled serfs tilling spartan land helot women were often used as wet nurses helots also travelled with the spartan army as non-combatant serfs at the last stand of the battle of thermopylae the greek dead included not just the legendary three hundred spartan soldiers but also several hundred thespian and theban troops and a number of helots
relations between the helots and their spartan masters were sometimes strained there was at least one helot revolt ca 465–460 bc and thucydides remarked that spartan policy is always mainly governed by the necessity of taking precautions against the helots on the other hand the spartans trusted their helots enough in 479 bc to take a force of 35,000 with them to plataea something they could not have risked if they feared the helots would attack them or run away slave revolts occurred elsewhere in the greek world and in 413 bc 20,000 athenian slaves ran away to join the spartan forces occupying attica what made spartas relations with her slave population unique was that the helots precisely because they enjoyed privileges such as family and property retained their identity as a conquered people the messenians and also had effective kinship groups that could be used to organize rebellion
as the spartiate population declined and the helot population continued to grow the imbalance of power caused increasing tension according to myron of priene of the middle 3rd century bc

they assign to the helots every shameful task leading to disgrace for they ordained that each one of them must wear a dogskin cap κυνῆ  kunễ and wrap himself in skins διφθέρα  diphthéra and receive a stipulated number of beatings every year regardless of any wrongdoing so that they would never forget they were slaves moreover if any exceeded the vigour proper to a slaves condition they made death the penalty and they allotted a punishment to those controlling them if they failed to rebuke those who were growing fat

plutarch also states that spartans treated the helots harshly and cruelly they compelled them to drink pure wine which was considered dangerous – wine usually being cut with water and to lead them in that condition into their public halls that the children might see what a sight a drunken man is they made them to dance low dances and sing ridiculous songs during syssitia obligatory banquets
each year when the ephors took office they ritually declared war on the helots thereby allowing spartans to kill them without the risk of ritual pollution this seems to have been done by kryptai sing κρύπτησ kryptēs graduates of the agoge who took part in the mysterious institution known as the krypteia thucydides states

the helots were invited by a proclamation to pick out those of their number who claimed to have most distinguished themselves against the enemy in order that they might receive their freedom the object being to test them as it was thought that the first to claim their freedom would be the most high spirited and the most apt to rebel as many as two thousand were selected accordingly who crowned themselves and went round the temples rejoicing in their new freedom the spartans however soon afterwards did away with them and no one ever knew how each of them perished


 perioikoi 

the perioikoi came from similar origins as the helots but occupied a significantly different position in spartan society although they did not enjoy full citizen-rights they were free and not subjected to the same restrictions as the helots the exact nature of their subjection to the spartans is not clear but they seem to have served partly as a kind of military reserve partly as skilled craftsmen and partly as agents of foreign trade perioikoic hoplites served increasingly with the spartan army explicitly at the battle of plataea and although they may also have fulfilled functions such as the manufacture and repair of armour and weapons they were increasingly integrated into the combat units of the spartan army as the spartiate population declined


 economy 

spartan citizens were debarred by law from trade or manufacture which consequently rested in the hands of the perioikoi the periokoi monopoly on trade and manufacturing in one of the richest territories of greece explains in large part the loyalty of the perioikoi to the spartan state lacedaemon was rich in natural resources fertile and blessed with a number of good natural harbors the periokoi could exploit these resources for their own enrichment and did
spartiates on the other hand were forbidden in theory from engaging in menial labor or trade although there is evidence of spartan sculptors and spartans were certainly poets magistrates ambassadors and governors as well as soldiers allegedly spartans were prohibited from possessing gold and silver coins and according to legend spartan currency consisted of iron bars to discourage hoarding it was not until the 260s or 250s bc that sparta began to mint its own coins
the conspicuous display of wealth appears to have been discouraged although this did not preclude the production of very fine highly decorated bronze ivory and wooden works of art and the production of jewellery archeology has produced many examples of all these objects some of which are exquisite
allegedly in connection with the lycurgan reforms eg in the mid-8th century bc property had been divided into 9,000 equal portions as part of a massive land reform each citizen received one estate a kleros and thereafter was expected to derive his wealth from it the land itself was worked by helots who retained half the yield from the other half the spartiate was expected to pay his mess syssitia fees and the agoge fees for his children however we know nothing about whether land could be bought and sold whether it could be inherited if so by what system primogeniture or equally divided among heirs whether daughters received dowries and much more what is clear is that from early on there were marked differences of wealth within the state and these became even more serious after the law of epitadeus passed at some time after the peloponnesian war removed the legal prohibition of the gift or bequest of land by the mid-5th century land had become concentrated in the hands of a tiny elite and the notion of all spartan citizens being equals had become a farce by aristotles day 384–322 bc citizenship had been reduced from 9,000 to less than 1,000 and then further decreased to 700 at the accession of agis iv in 244 bc attempts were made to remedy this situation by creating new laws certain penalties were imposed upon those who remained unmarried or who married too late in life these laws however came too late and were ineffective in reversing the trend


 life in classical sparta 


 birth and death 
sparta was above all a militarist state and emphasis on military fitness began virtually at birth shortly after birth a mother would bathe her child in wine to see whether the child was strong if the child survived it was brought before the gerousia by the childs father the gerousia then decided whether it was to be reared or not it is commonly stated that if they considered it puny and deformed the baby was thrown into a chasm on mount taygetos known euphemistically as the apothetae gr ἀποθέται deposits this was in effect a primitive form of eugenics sparta is often portrayed as being unique in this matter however there is considerable evidence that the killing of unwanted children was practiced in other greek regions including athens there is controversy about the matter in sparta since excavations in the chasm only uncovered adult remains likely belonging to criminals
when spartans died marked headstones would only be granted to soldiers who died in combat during a victorious campaign or women who died either in service of a divine office or in childbirth


 education 

when male spartans began military training at age seven they would enter the agoge system the agoge was designed to encourage discipline and physical toughness and to emphasize the importance of the spartan state boys lived in communal messes and according to xenophon whose sons attended the agoge the boys were fed just the right amount for them never to become sluggish through being too full while also giving them a taste of what it is not to have enough in addition they were trained to survived in times of privation even if it meant stealing besides physical and weapons training boys studied reading writing music and dancing special punishments were imposed if boys failed to answer questions sufficiently laconically ie briefly and wittily
there is some evidence that in late-classical and hellenistic sparta boys were expected to take an older male mentor usually an unmarried young man however there is no evidence of this in archaic sparta according to some sources the older man was expected to function as a kind of substitute father and role model to his junior partner however others believe it was reasonably certain that they had sexual relations the exact nature of spartan pederasty is not entirely clear it is notable however that the only contemporary source with direct experience of the agoge xenophon explicitly denies the sexual nature of the relationship
post 465 bc some spartan youth apparently became members of an irregular unit known as the krypteia the immediate objective of this unit was to seek out and kill vulnerable helot laconians as part of the larger program of terrorising and intimidating the helot population
less information is available about the education of spartan girls but they seem to have gone through a fairly extensive formal educational cycle broadly similar to that of the boys but with less emphasis on military training in this respect classical sparta was unique in ancient greece in no other city-state did women receive any kind of formal education


 military life 

at age 20 the spartan citizen began his membership in one of the syssitia dining messes or clubs composed of about fifteen members each of which every citizen was required to be a member here each group learned how to bond and rely on one another the spartans were not eligible for election for public office until the age of 30 only native spartans were considered full citizens and were obliged to undergo the training as prescribed by law as well as participate in and contribute financially to one of the syssitia
sparta is thought to be the first city to practice athletic nudity and some scholars claim that it was also the first to formalize pederasty according to these sources the spartans believed that the love of an older accomplished aristocrat for an adolescent was essential to his formation as a free citizen the agoge the education of the ruling class was they claim founded on pederastic relationships required of each citizen with the lover responsible for the boys training
however other scholars question this interpretation xenophon explicitly denies it but not plutarch
spartan men remained in the active reserve until age 60 men were encouraged to marry at age 20 but could not live with their families until they left their active military service at age 30 they called themselves homoioi equals pointing to their common lifestyle and the discipline of the phalanx which demanded that no soldier be superior to his comrades insofar as hoplite warfare could be perfected the spartans did so
thucydides reports that when a spartan man went to war his wife or another woman of some significance would customarily present him with his hoplon shield and say with this or upon this ἢ τὰν ἢ ἐπὶ τᾶσ èi tàn èi èpì tàs meaning that true spartans could only return to sparta either victorious with their shield in hand or dead carried upon it unfortunately poignant as this image may be it is almost certainly propaganda spartans buried their battle dead on or near the battle field corpses were not brought back on their hoplons nevertheless it is fair to say that it was less of a disgrace for a soldier to lose his helmet breastplate or greaves than his hoplon since the former were designed to protect one man whereas the hoplon also protected the man on his left thus the shield was symbolic of the individual soldiers subordination to his unit his integral part in its success and his solemn responsibility to his comrades in arms – messmates and friends often close blood relations
according to aristotle the spartan military culture was actually short-sighted and ineffective he observed

it is the standards of civilized men not of beasts that must be kept in mind for it is good men not beasts who are capable of real courage those like the spartans who concentrate on the one and ignore the other in their education turn men into machines and in devoting themselves to one single aspect of citys life end up making them inferior even in that

aristotle was a harsh critic of the spartan constitution and way of life there is considerable evidence that the spartans certainly in the archaic period were not educated as one-sidedly as aristotle asserts in fact the spartans were also rigorously trained in logic and philosophy
one of the most persistent myths about sparta that has no basis in fact is the notion that spartan mothers were without feelings toward their off-spring and helped enforce a militaristic lifestyle on their sons and husbands the myth can be traced back to plutarch who includes no less than 17 sayings of spartan women all of which paraphrase or elaborate on the theme that spartan mothers rejected their own offspring if they showed any kind of cowardice in some of these sayings mothers revile their sons in insulting language merely for surviving a battle these sayings purporting to be from spartan women were far more likely to be of athenian origin and designed to portray spartan women as unnatural and so undeserving of pity


 agriculture food and diet 
spartas agriculture consisted mainly of barley wine cheese grain and figs these items were grown locally on each spartan citizens kleros and were tended to by helots spartan citizens were required to donate a certain amount of what they yielded from their kleros to their syssitia or mess these donations to the syssitia were a requirement for every spartan citizen all the donated food was then redistributed to feed the spartan population of that syssitia the helots who tended to the lands were fed using a portion of what they harvested


 marriage 
plutarch reports the peculiar customs associated with the spartan wedding night

the custom was to capture women for marriage the so-called bridesmaid took charge of the captured girl she first shaved her head to the scalp then dressed her in a mans cloak and sandals and laid her down alone on a mattress in the dark the bridegroom – who was not drunk and thus not impotent but was sober as always – first had dinner in the messes then would slip in undo her belt lift her and carry her to the bed

the husband continued to visit his wife in secret for some time after the marriage these customs unique to the spartans have been interpreted in various ways one of them decidedly supports the need to disguise the bride as a man in order to help the bridegroom consummate the marriage so unaccustomed were men to womens looks at the time of their first intercourse the abduction may have served to ward off the evil eye and the cutting of the wifes hair was perhaps part of a rite of passage that signaled her entrance into a new life


 role of women 


 political social and economic equality 
spartan women of the citizenry class enjoyed a status power and respect that was unknown in the rest of the classical world the higher status of females in spartan society started at birth unlike athens spartan girls were fed the same food as their brothers nor were they confined to their fathers house and prevented from exercising or getting fresh air as in athens but exercised and even competed in sports most important rather than being married off at the age of 12 or 13 spartan law forbade the marriage of a girl until she was in her late teens or early 20s the reasons for delaying marriage were to ensure the birth of healthy children but the effect was to spare spartan women the hazards and lasting health damage associated with pregnancy among adolescents spartan women better fed from childhood and fit from exercise stood a far better chance of reaching old age than their sisters in other greek cities where the median age for death was 34.6 years or roughly 10 years below that of men
unlike athenian women who wore heavy concealing clothes and were rarely seen outside the house spartan women wore dresses peplos slit up the side to allow freer movement and moved freely about the city either walking or driving chariots girls as well as boys exercised possibly in the nude and young women as well as young men may have participated in the gymnopaedia festival of nude youths
another practice that was mentioned by many visitors to sparta was the practice of “wife-sharing” in accordance with the spartan belief that breeding should be between the most physically fit parents many older men allowed younger more fit men to impregnate their wives other unmarried or childless men might even request another man’s wife to bear his children if she had previously been a strong child bearer for this reason many considered spartan women polygamous or polyandrous this practice was encouraged in order that women bear as many strong-bodied children as they could the spartan population was hard to maintain due to the constant absence and loss of the men in battle and the intense physical inspection of newborns
spartan women were also literate and numerate a rarity in the ancient world furthermore as a result of their education and the fact that they moved freely in society engaging with their fellow male citizens they were notorious for speaking their minds even in public plato in the middle of the fourth century described womens curriculum in sparta as consisting of gymnastics and mousike music and arts plato goes on to praise spartan womens ability when it came to philosophical discussion
most importantly spartan women had economic power because they controlled their own properties and those of their husbands it is estimated that in later classical sparta when the male population was in serious decline women were the sole owners of at least 35% of all land and property in sparta the laws regarding a divorce were the same for both men and women unlike women in athens if a spartan woman became the heiress of her father because she had no living brothers to inherit an epikleros the woman was not required to divorce her current spouse in order to marry her nearest paternal relative
spartan women acquired so much wealth that in aristotle’s analysis of the laws and history of sparta he attributed its precipitous fall which happened during his lifetime from being the master of greece to a second rate power in less than 50 years to the fact that sparta had become a gynecocracy whose intemperate women loved luxury these tendencies became worse after the huge influx of wealth following the spartan victory of the peloponnesian war leading to the eventual downfall of sparta


 historic women 
many women played a significant role in the history of sparta queen gorgo heiress to the throne and the wife of leonidas i was an influential and well-documented figure herodotus records that as a small girl she advised her father cleomenes to resist a bribe she was later said to be responsible for decoding a warning that the persian forces were about to invade greece after spartan generals could not decode a wooden tablet covered in wax she ordered them to clear the wax revealing the warning plutarchs moralia contains a collection of sayings of spartan women including a laconic quip attributed to gorgo when asked by a woman from attica why spartan women were the only women in the world who could rule men she replied because we are the only women who are mothers of men


 laconophilia 

laconophilia is love or admiration of sparta and of the spartan culture or constitution sparta was subject of considerable admiration in its day even in its rival athens in ancient times many of the noblest and best of the athenians always considered the spartan state nearly as an ideal theory realised in practice many greek philosophers especially platonists would often describe sparta as an ideal state strong brave and free from the corruptions of commerce and money

with the revival of classical learning in renaissance europe laconophilia re-appears for examples in the writings of machiavelli the elizabethan english constitutionalist john aylmer compared the mixed government of tudor england to the spartan republic stating that lacedemonia meaning sparta was the noblest and best city governed that ever was he commended it as a model for england the swiss-french philosopher jean-jacques rousseau contrasted sparta favourably with athens in his discourse on the arts and sciences arguing that its austere constitution was preferable to the more cultured nature of athenian life sparta was also used as a model of social purity by revolutionary and napoleonic france
certain early zionists and particularly the founders of kibbutz movement in israel had been influenced by spartan ideals particularly as a model for education tabenkin for example a founding father of the kibbutz and the palmach was influenced by spartan education he prescribed that education for warfare should begin from the nursery that children should from kindergarten age be taken to spend nights in the mountains and valleys
a new element of laconophilia by karl otfried müller who linked spartan ideals to the supposed racial superiority of the dorians the ethnic sub-group of the greeks to which the spartans belonged adolf hitler praised the spartans recommending in 1928 that germany should imitate them by limiting the number allowed to live he added that the spartans were once capable of such a wise measure the subjugation of 350,000 helots by 6,000 spartans was only possible because of the racial superiority of the spartans the spartans had created the first racialist state
in the modern times the adjective spartan is used to imply simplicity frugality or avoidance of luxury and comfort the term laconic phrase describes a very terse and concise way of speaking that was characteristic of the spartans
sparta also features prominently in modern popular culture see sparta in popular culture particularly the battle of thermopylae see battle of thermopylae in popular culture
