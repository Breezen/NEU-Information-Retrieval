each member in a semester series of solar eclipses repeats approximately every 177 days and 4 hours a semester at alternating nodes of the moons orbit


 saros 133 
solar saros 133 repeating every 18 years 11 days contains 72 events the series started with a partial solar eclipse on july 13 1219 it contains annular eclipses from november 20 1435 through january 13 1526 with a hybrid eclipse on january 24 1544 it has total eclipses from february 3 1562 through june 21 2373 the series ends at member 72 as a partial eclipse on september 5 2499 the longest duration of totality was 6 minutes 50 seconds on august 7 1850 the total eclipses of this saros series are getting shorter and farther south with each iteration


 inex series 
this eclipse is a part of the long period inex cycle repeating at alternating nodes every 358 synodic months ≈ 10,571.95 days or 29 years minus 20 days their appearance and longitude are irregular due to a lack of synchronization with the anomalistic month period of perigee however groupings of 3 inex cycles ≈ 87 years minus 2 months comes close ≈ 1,151.02 anomalistic months so eclipses are similar in these groupings


 metonic series 
the metonic series repeats eclipses every 19 years 6939.69 days lasting about 5 cycles eclipses occur in nearly the same calendar date in addition the octon subseries repeats 1/5 of that or every 3.8 years 1387.94 days
