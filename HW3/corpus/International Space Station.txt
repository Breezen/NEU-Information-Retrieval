the international space station iss is a space station or a habitable artificial satellite in low earth orbit its first component launched into orbit in 1998 the last pressurised module was fitted in 2011 and the station is expected to be used until 2028 development and assembly of the station continues with components scheduled for launch in 2018 and 2019 the iss is the largest human-made body in low earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from earth the iss consists of pressurised modules external trusses solar arrays and other components iss components have been launched by russian proton and soyuz rockets and american space shuttles
the iss serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which crew members conduct experiments in biology human biology physics astronomy meteorology and other fields the station is suited for the testing of spacecraft systems and equipment required for missions to the moon and mars the iss maintains an orbit with an altitude of between 330 and 435 km 205 and 270 mi by means of reboost manoeuvres using the engines of the zvezda module or visiting spacecraft it completes 15.54 orbits per day
the iss programme is a joint project among five participating space agencies nasa roscosmos jaxa esa and csa the ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements the station is divided into two sections the russian orbital segment ros and the united states orbital segment usos which is shared by many nations as of january 2014 the american portion of iss is being funded until 2024 roscosmos has endorsed the continued operation of iss through 2024 but has proposed using elements of the russian orbital segment to construct a new russian space station called opsek
the iss is the ninth space station to be inhabited by crews following the soviet and later russian salyut almaz and mir stations as well as skylab from the us the station has been continuously occupied for 17 years and 137 days since the arrival of expedition 1 on 2 november 2000 this is the longest continuous human presence in low earth orbit having surpassed the previous record of 9 years and 357 days held by mir the station is serviced by a variety of visiting spacecraft the russian soyuz and progress the american dragon and cygnus the japanese h-ii transfer vehicle and formerly the space shuttle and the european automated transfer vehicle it has been visited by astronauts cosmonauts and space tourists from 17 different nations
after the us space shuttle programme ended in 2011 soyuz rockets became the only provider of transport for astronauts at the international space station and dragon became the only provider of bulk cargo return to earth called downmass soyuz has very limited downmass capability
on 28 march 2015 russian sources announced that roscosmos and nasa had agreed to collaborate on the development of a replacement for the current iss nasa later issued a guarded statement expressing thanks for russias interest in future co-operation in space exploration but fell short of confirming the russian announcement


 purpose 

according to the original memorandum of understanding between nasa and rosaviakosmos the international space station was intended to be a laboratory observatory and factory in low earth orbit it was also planned to provide transportation maintenance and act as a staging base for possible future missions to the moon mars and asteroids in the 2010 united states national space policy the iss was given additional roles of serving commercial diplomatic and educational purposes


 scientific research 

the iss provides a platform to conduct scientific research small unmanned spacecraft can provide platforms for zero gravity and exposure to space but space stations offer a long-term environment where studies can be performed potentially for decades combined with ready access by human researchers over periods that exceed the capabilities of manned spacecraft
the iss simplifies individual experiments by eliminating the need for separate rocket launches and research staff the wide variety of research fields include astrobiology astronomy human research including space medicine and life sciences physical sciences materials science space weather and weather on earth meteorology scientists on earth have access to the crews data and can modify experiments or launch new ones which are benefits generally unavailable on unmanned spacecraft crews fly expeditions of several months duration providing approximately 160-man-hours per week of labour with a crew of 6
to detect dark matter and answer other fundamental questions about our universe engineers and scientists from all over the world built the alpha magnetic spectrometer ams which nasa compares to the hubble space telescope and says could not be accommodated on a free flying satellite platform partly because of its power requirements and data bandwidth needs on 3 april 2013 nasa scientists reported that hints of dark matter may have been detected by the alpha magnetic spectrometer according to the scientists the first results from the space-borne alpha magnetic spectrometer confirm an unexplained excess of high-energy positrons in earth-bound cosmic rays

the space environment is hostile to life unprotected presence in space is characterised by an intense radiation field consisting primarily of protons and other subatomic charged particles from the solar wind in addition to cosmic rays high vacuum extreme temperatures and microgravity some simple forms of life called extremophiles including small invertebrates called tardigrades can survive in this environment in an extremely dry state called desiccation
medical research improves knowledge about the effects of long-term space exposure on the human body including muscle atrophy bone loss and fluid shift this data will be used to determine whether lengthy human spaceflight and space colonisation are feasible as of 2006 data on bone loss and muscular atrophy suggest that there would be a significant risk of fractures and movement problems if astronauts landed on a planet after a lengthy interplanetary cruise such as the six-month interval required to travel to mars medical studies are conducted aboard the iss on behalf of the national space biomedical research institute nsbri prominent among these is the advanced diagnostic ultrasound in microgravity study in which astronauts perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts the study considers the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions in space usually there is no physician on board the iss and diagnosis of medical conditions is a challenge it is anticipated that remotely guided ultrasound scans will have application on earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is difficult


 microgravity 

the earths gravity is only slightly weaker at the altitude of the iss than at the surface but objects in orbit are in a continuous state of freefall resulting in an apparent state of weightlessness this perceived weightlessness is disturbed by five separate effects
drag from the residual atmosphere when the iss enters the earths shadow the main solar panels are rotated to minimise this aerodynamic drag helping reduce orbital decay
vibration from movements of mechanical systems and the crew
actuation of the on-board attitude control moment gyroscopes
thruster firings for attitude or orbital changes
gravity-gradient effects also known as tidal effects items at different locations within the iss would if not attached to the station follow slightly different orbits being mechanically interconnected these items experience small forces that keep the station moving as a rigid body

researchers are investigating the effect of the stations near-weightless environment on the evolution development growth and internal processes of plants and animals in response to some of this data nasa wants to investigate microgravitys effects on the growth of three-dimensional human-like tissues and the unusual protein crystals that can be formed in space
investigating the physics of fluids in microgravity will provide better models of the behaviour of fluids because fluids can be almost completely combined in microgravity physicists investigate fluids that do not mix well on earth in addition examining reactions that are slowed by low gravity and low temperatures will improve our understanding of superconductivity
the study of materials science is an important iss research activity with the objective of reaping economic benefits through the improvement of techniques used on the ground other areas of interest include the effect of the low gravity environment on combustion through the study of the efficiency of burning and control of emissions and pollutants these findings may improve current knowledge about energy production and lead to economic and environmental benefits future plans are for the researchers aboard the iss to examine aerosols ozone water vapour and oxides in earths atmosphere as well as cosmic rays cosmic dust antimatter and dark matter in the universe


 exploration 

the iss provides a location in the relative safety of low earth orbit to test spacecraft systems that will be required for long-duration missions to the moon and mars this provides experience in operations maintenance as well as repair and replacement activities on-orbit which will be essential skills in operating spacecraft farther from earth mission risks can be reduced and the capabilities of interplanetary spacecraft advanced referring to the mars-500 experiment esa states that whereas the iss is essential for answering questions concerning the possible impact of weightlessness radiation and other space-specific factors aspects such as the effect of long-term isolation and confinement can be more appropriately addressed via ground-based simulations sergey krasnov the head of human space flight programmes for russias space agency roscosmos in 2011 suggested a shorter version of mars-500 may be carried out on the iss
in 2009 noting the value of the partnership framework itself sergey krasnov wrote when compared with partners acting separately partners developing complementary abilities and resources could give us much more assurance of the success and safety of space exploration the iss is helping further advance near-earth space exploration and realisation of prospective programmes of research and exploration of the solar system including the moon and mars a manned mission to mars may be a multinational effort involving space agencies and countries outside the current iss partnership in 2010 esa director-general jean-jacques dordain stated his agency was ready to propose to the other four partners that china india and south korea be invited to join the iss partnership nasa chief charlie bolden stated in february 2011 any mission to mars is likely to be a global effort currently american legislation prevents nasa co-operation with china on space projects


 education and cultural outreach 

the iss crew provides opportunities for students on earth by running student-developed experiments making educational demonstrations allowing for student participation in classroom versions of iss experiments and directly engaging students using radio videolink and email esa offers a wide range of free teaching materials that can be downloaded for use in classrooms in one lesson students can navigate a 3-d model of the interior and exterior of the iss and face spontaneous challenges to solve in real time
jaxa aims both to stimulate the curiosity of children cultivating their spirits and encouraging their passion to pursue craftsmanship and to heighten the childs awareness of the importance of life and their responsibilities in society through a series of education guides a deeper understanding of the past and near-term future of manned space flight as well as that of earth and life will be learned in the jaxa seeds in space experiments the mutation effects of spaceflight on plant seeds aboard the iss is explored students grow sunflower seeds which flew on the iss for about nine months as a start to touch the universe in the first phase of kibō utilisation from 2008 to mid-2010 researchers from more than a dozen japanese universities conducted experiments in diverse fields

cultural activities are another major objective tetsuo tanaka director of jaxas space environment and utilization center says there is something about space that touches even people who are not interested in science
amateur radio on the iss ariss is a volunteer programme which encourages students worldwide to pursue careers in science technology engineering and mathematics through amateur radio communications opportunities with the iss crew ariss is an international working group consisting of delegations from nine countries including several countries in europe as well as japan russia canada and the united states in areas where radio equipment cannot be used speakerphones connect students to ground stations which then connect the calls to the station
first orbit is a feature-length documentary film about vostok 1 the first manned space flight around the earth by matching the orbit of the international space station to that of vostok 1 as closely as possible in terms of ground path and time of day documentary filmmaker christopher riley and esa astronaut paolo nespoli were able to film the view that yuri gagarin saw on his pioneering orbital space flight this new footage was cut together with the original vostok 1 mission audio recordings sourced from the russian state archive nespoli during expedition 26/27 filmed the majority of the footage for this documentary film and as a result is credited as its director of photography the film was streamed through the website firstorbitorg in a global youtube premiere in 2011 under a free license
in may 2013 commander chris hadfield shot a music video of david bowies space oddity on board the station the film was released on youtube it was the first music video ever to be filmed in space

in november 2017 while participating in expedition 52/53 on the iss paolo nespoli made two recordings one in english the other in his native italian of his spoken voice for use on wikipedia articles these were the first content made specifically for wikipedia in space


 assembly 

the assembly of the international space station a major endeavour in space architecture began in november 1998 russian modules launched and docked robotically with the exception of rassvet all other modules were delivered by the space shuttle which required installation by iss and shuttle crewmembers using the canadarm2 ssrms and extra-vehicular activities evas as of 5 june 2011 they had added 159 components during more than 1,000 hours of eva see list of iss spacewalks 127 of these spacewalks originated from the station and the remaining 32 were launched from the airlocks of docked space shuttles the beta angle of the station had to be considered at all times during construction as it directly affects how long during its orbit the station and any docked or docking spacecraft is exposed to the sun the space shuttle would not perform optimally above a limit called the beta cutoff many of the modules that launched on the space shuttle were integrated and tested on the ground at the space station processing facility to find and correct issues prior to launch
the first module of the iss zarya was launched on 20 november 1998 on an autonomous russian proton rocket it provided propulsion attitude control communications electrical power but lacked long-term life support functions two weeks later a passive nasa module unity was launched aboard space shuttle flight sts-88 and attached to zarya by astronauts during evas this module has two pressurized mating adapters pmas one connects permanently to zarya the other allows the space shuttle to dock to the space station at that time the russian station mir was still inhabited the iss remained unmanned for two years while mir was de-orbited on 12 july 2000 zvezda was launched into orbit preprogrammed commands on board deployed its solar arrays and communications antenna it then became the passive target for a rendezvous with zarya and unity it maintained a station-keeping orbit while the zarya-unity vehicle performed the rendezvous and docking via ground control and the russian automated rendezvous and docking system zaryas computer transferred control of the station to zvezdas computer soon after docking zvezda added sleeping quarters a toilet kitchen co2 scrubbers dehumidifier oxygen generators exercise equipment plus data voice and television communications with mission control this enabled permanent habitation of the station
the first resident crew expedition 1 arrived in november 2000 on soyuz tm-31 at the end of the first day on the station astronaut bill shepherd requested the use of the radio call sign alpha which he and cosmonaut krikalev preferred to the more cumbersome international space station the name alpha had previously been used for the station in the early 1990s and following the request its use was authorised for the whole of expedition 1 shepherd had been advocating the use of a new name to project managers for some time referencing a naval tradition in a pre-launch news conference he had said for thousands of years humans have been going to sea in ships people have designed and built these vessels launched them with a good feeling that a name will bring good fortune to the crew and success to their voyage yuri semenov the president of russian space corporation energia at the time disapproved of the name alpha he felt that mir was the first space station and so he would have preferred the names beta or mir 2 for the iss
expedition 1 arrived midway between the flights of sts-92 and sts-97 these two space shuttle flights each added segments of the stations integrated truss structure which provided the station with ku-band communication for us television additional attitude support needed for the additional mass of the usos and substantial solar arrays supplementing the stations existing 4 solar arrays
over the next two years the station continued to expand a soyuz-u rocket delivered the pirs docking compartment the space shuttles discovery atlantis and endeavour delivered the destiny laboratory and quest airlock in addition to the stations main robot arm the canadarm2 and several more segments of the integrated truss structure
the expansion schedule was interrupted by the space shuttle columbia disaster in 2003 and a resulting two-year hiatus in the space shuttle programme the space shuttle was grounded until 2005 with sts-114 flown by discovery
assembly resumed in 2006 with the arrival of sts-115 with atlantis which delivered the stations second set of solar arrays several more truss segments and a third set of arrays were delivered on sts-116 sts-117 and sts-118 as a result of the major expansion of the stations power-generating capabilities more pressurised modules could be accommodated and the harmony node and columbus european laboratory were added these were soon followed by the first two components of kibō in march 2009 sts-119 completed the integrated truss structure with the installation of the fourth and final set of solar arrays the final section of kibō was delivered in july 2009 on sts-127 followed by the russian poisk module the third node tranquility was delivered in february 2010 during sts-130 by the space shuttle endeavour alongside the cupola followed in may 2010 by the penultimate russian module rassvet rassvet was delivered by space shuttle atlantis on sts-132 in exchange for the russian proton delivery of the zarya module in 1998 which had been funded by the united states the last pressurised module of the usos leonardo was brought to the station by discovery on her final flight sts-133 in february 2011 the alpha magnetic spectrometer was delivered by endeavour on sts-134 the same year
as of june 2011 the station consisted of 15 pressurised modules and the integrated truss structure five modules are still to be launched including the nauka with the european robotic arm the uzlovoy module and two power modules called nem-1 and nem-2 as of august 2017 russias future primary research module nauka is set to launch in the first quarter of 2018 along with the european robotic arm which will be able to relocate itself to different parts of the russian modules of the station after the nauka module is attached the uzlovoy module will be attached to one of its docking ports when completed the station will have a mass of more than 400 tonnes 440 short tons
the gross mass of the station changes over time the total launch mass of the modules on orbit is about 417,289 kg 919,965 lb as of 3 september 2011 the mass of experiments spare parts personal effects crew foodstuff clothing propellants water supplies gas supplies docked spacecraft and other items add to the total mass of the station hydrogen gas is constantly vented overboard by the oxygen generators

 unpressurised elements 

the iss has a large number of external components that do not require pressurisation the largest of these is the integrated truss structure its to which the stations main solar arrays and thermal radiators are mounted the its consists of ten separate segments forming a structure 108.5 m 356 ft long
the station in its complete form has several smaller external components such as the six robotic arms the three external stowage platforms esps and four express logistics carriers elcs while these platforms allow experiments including misse the stp-h3 and the robotic refueling mission to be deployed and conducted in the vacuum of space by providing electricity and processing experimental data locally their primary function is to store spare orbital replacement units orus orus are parts that can be replaced when they fail or pass their design life examples of orus include pumps storage tanks antennas and battery units such units are replaced either by astronauts during eva or by robotic arms spare parts were routinely transported to and from the station via space shuttle resupply missions with a heavy emphasis on oru transport once the nasa shuttle approached retirement several shuttle missions were dedicated to the delivery of orus including sts-129 sts-133 and sts-134 as of january 2011 only one other mode of transportation of orus had been utilised – the japanese cargo vessel htv-2 – which delivered an fhrc and ctc-2 via its exposed pallet ep

there are also smaller exposure facilities mounted directly to laboratory modules the kibō exposed facility serves as an external porch for the kibō complex and a facility on the european columbus laboratory provides power and data connections for experiments such as the european technology exposure facility and the atomic clock ensemble in space a remote sensing instrument sage iii-iss was delivered to the station in 2014 aboard a dragon capsule and the nicer experiment is scheduled to be delivered in 2016 the largest such scientific payload externally mounted to the iss is the alpha magnetic spectrometer ams a particle physics experiment launched on sts-134 in may 2011 and mounted externally on the its the ams measures cosmic rays to look for evidence of dark matter and antimatter
the commercial bartolomeo external payload hosting platform manufactured by airbus is due to launch in may 2019 aboard a commercial iss resupply vehicle and be attached to the european columbus module it will provide a further 12 external payload slots supplementing the eight on the express logistics carriers ten on kibō and four on columbus the system is designed to be robotically serviced and will require no astronaut intervention it is named after christopher columbuss younger brother


 robotic arms and cargo cranes 

the integrated truss structure serves as a base for the stations primary remote manipulator system called the mobile servicing system mss which is composed of three main components canadarm2 the largest robotic arm on the iss has a mass of 1,800 kilograms 4,000 lb and is used to dock and manipulate spacecraft and modules on the usos hold crew members and equipment in place during evas and move dextre around to perform tasks dextre is a 1,560 kg 3,440 lb robotic manipulator with two arms a rotating torso and has power tools lights and video for replacing orbital replacement units orus and performing other tasks requiring fine control the mobile base system mbs is a platform which rides on rails along the length of the stations main truss it serves as a mobile base for canadarm2 and dextre allowing the robotic arms to reach all parts of the usos to gain access to the russian segment a grapple fixture was added to zarya on sts-134 so that canadarm2 can inchworm itself onto the ros also installed during sts-134 was the 15 m 50 ft orbiter boom sensor system obss which had been used to inspect heat shield tiles on space shuttle missions and can be used on station to increase the reach of the mss staff on earth or the station can operate the mss components via remote control performing work outside the station without space walks
japans remote manipulator system which services the kibō exposed facility was launched on sts-124 and is attached to the kibō pressurised module the arm is similar to the space shuttle arm as it is permanently attached at one end and has a latching end effector for standard grapple fixtures at the other
the european robotic arm which will service the russian orbital segment will be launched alongside the multipurpose laboratory module in 2017 the ros does not require spacecraft or modules to be manipulated as all spacecraft and modules dock automatically and may be discarded the same way crew use the two strela russian стрела́ lit arrow cargo cranes during evas for moving crew and equipment around the ros each strela crane has a mass of 45 kg 99 lb


 station systems 


 life support 

the critical systems are the atmosphere control system the water supply system the food supply facilities the sanitation and hygiene equipment and fire detection and suppression equipment the russian orbital segments life support systems are contained in the zvezda service module some of these systems are supplemented by equipment in the usos the mlm nauka laboratory has a complete set of life support systems


 atmospheric control systems 

the atmosphere on board the iss is similar to the earths normal air pressure on the iss is 101.3 kpa 14.7 psi the same as at sea level on earth an earth-like atmosphere offers benefits for crew comfort and is much safer than the alternative a pure oxygen atmosphere because of the increased risk of a fire such as that responsible for the deaths of the apollo 1 crew earth-like atmospheric conditions have been maintained on all russian and soviet spacecraft
the elektron system aboard zvezda and a similar system in destiny generate oxygen aboard the station the crew has a backup option in the form of bottled oxygen and solid fuel oxygen generation sfog canisters a chemical oxygen generator system carbon dioxide is removed from the air by the vozdukh system in zvezda other by-products of human metabolism such as methane from the intestines and ammonia from sweat are removed by activated charcoal filters
part of the ros atmosphere control system is the oxygen supply triple-redundancy is provided by the elektron unit solid fuel generators and stored oxygen the primary supply of oxygen is the elektron unit which produces o
2 and h
2 by electrolysis of water and vents h2 overboard the 1 kw system uses approximately one litre of water per crew member per day this water is either brought from earth or recycled from other systems mir was the first spacecraft to use recycled water for oxygen production the secondary oxygen supply is provided by burning o
2-producing vika cartridges see also iss eclss each candle takes 5–20 minutes to decompose at 450–500 °c producing 600 litres of o
2 this unit is manually operated
the us orbital segment has redundant supplies of oxygen from a pressurised storage tank on the quest airlock module delivered in 2001 supplemented ten years later by esa-built advanced closed-loop system acls in the tranquility module node 3 which produces o
2 by electrolysis hydrogen produced is combined with carbon dioxide from the cabin atmosphere and converted to water and methane


 power and thermal control 

double-sided solar or photovoltaic arrays provide electrical power for the iss these bifacial cells are more efficient and operate at a lower temperature than single-sided cells commonly used on earth by collecting sunlight on one side and light reflected off the earth on the other
the russian segment of the station like the space shuttle and most spacecraft uses 28 volt dc from four rotating solar arrays mounted on zarya and zvezda the usos uses 130–180 v dc from the usos pv array power is stabilised and distributed at 160 v dc and converted to the user-required 124 v dc the higher distribution voltage allows smaller lighter conductors at the expense of crew safety the ros uses low voltage the two station segments share power with converters
the usos solar arrays are arranged as four wing pairs for a total production of 75 to 90 kilowatts these arrays normally track the sun to maximise power generation each array is about 375 m2 4,036 sq ft in area and 58 m 190 ft long in the complete configuration the solar arrays track the sun by rotating the alpha gimbal once per orbit the beta gimbal follows slower changes in the angle of the sun to the orbital plane the night glider mode aligns the solar arrays parallel to the ground at night to reduce the significant aerodynamic drag at the stations relatively low orbital altitude
the station uses rechargeable nickel–hydrogen batteries nih
2 for continuous power during the 35 minutes of every 90-minute orbit that it is eclipsed by the earth the batteries are recharged on the day side of the earth they have a 6.5-year lifetime over 37,000 chargedischarge cycles and will be regularly replaced over the anticipated 20-year life of the station as of 2017 the nickel–hydrogen batteries are being replaced by lithium-ion batteries which are expected to last until the end of the iss program
the stations large solar panels generate a high potential voltage difference between the station and the ionosphere this could cause arcing through insulating surfaces and sputtering of conductive surfaces as ions are accelerated by the spacecraft plasma sheath to mitigate this plasma contactor units pcus create current paths between the station and the ambient plasma field

the stations systems and experiments consume a large amount of electrical power almost all of which converts to heat little of this heat dissipates through the walls of the station to keep the internal ambient temperature within comfortable workable limits ammonia is continuously pumped through pipes throughout the station to collect heat then into external radiators to emit infrared radiation then back into the station thus this passive thermal control system ptcs is made of external surface materials insulation such as mli and heat pipes
if the ptcs cannot keep up with the heat load an external active thermal control system eatcs maintains the temperature the eatcs consists of an internal non-toxic water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere which transfers collected heat into an external liquid ammonia loop that can withstand the much lower temperature of space and is circulated through radiators to remove the heat the eatcs provides cooling for all the us pressurised modules including kibō and columbus as well as the main power distribution electronics of the s0 s1 and p1 trusses it can reject up to 70 kw this is much more than the 14 kw of the early external active thermal control system eeatcs via the early ammonia servicer eas which was launched on sts-105 and installed onto the p6 truss


 communications and computers 

radio communications provide telemetry and scientific data links between the station and mission control centres radio links are also used during rendezvous and docking procedures and for audio and video communication between crew members flight controllers and family members as a result the iss is equipped with internal and external communication systems used for different purposes
the russian orbital segment communicates directly with the ground via the lira antenna mounted to zvezda the lira antenna also has the capability to use the luch data relay satellite system this system used for communications with mir fell into disrepair during the 1990s and so is no longer in use although two new luch satellites—luch-5a and luch-5b—were launched in 2011 and 2012 respectively to restore the operational capability of the system another russian communications system is the voskhod-m which enables internal telephone communications between zvezda zarya pirs poisk and the usos and also provides a vhf radio link to ground control centres via antennas on zvezdas exterior
the us orbital segment usos makes use of two separate radio links mounted in the z1 truss structure the s band used for audio and ku band used for audio video and data systems these transmissions are routed via the united states tracking and data relay satellite system tdrss in geostationary orbit which allows for almost continuous real-time communications with nasas mission control center mcc-h in houston data channels for the canadarm2 european columbus laboratory and japanese kibō modules are routed via the s band and ku band systems although the european data relay system and a similar japanese system will eventually complement the tdrss in this role communications between modules are carried on an internal digital wireless network

uhf radio is used by astronauts and cosmonauts conducting evas uhf is used by other spacecraft that dock to or undock from the station such as soyuz progress htv atv and the space shuttle except the shuttle also makes use of the s band and ku band systems via tdrss to receive commands from mission control and iss crewmembers automated spacecraft are fitted with their own communications equipment the atv uses a laser attached to the spacecraft and equipment attached to zvezda known as the proximity communications equipment to accurately dock to the station
the iss is equipped with approximately 100 ibm and lenovo thinkpad model a31 and t61p laptop computers each computer is a commercial off-the-shelf purchase which is then modified for safety and operation including updates to connectors cooling and power to accommodate the stations 28v dc power system and weightless environment heat generated by the laptops does not rise but stagnates around the laptop so additional forced ventilation is required laptops aboard the iss are connected to the stations wireless lan via wi-fi and to the ground via ku band this provides speeds of 10 mbits to and 3 mbits from the station comparable to home dsl connection speeds
the operating system used for key station functions is the debian linux distribution the migration from microsoft windows was made in may 2013 for reasons of reliability stability and flexibility


 station operations 


 expeditions and private flights 
see also the list of international space station expeditions professional crew space tourism private travellers and the list of human spaceflights to the iss both

each permanent crew is given an expedition number expeditions run up to six months from launch until undocking an increment covers the same time period but includes cargo ships and all activities expeditions 1 to 6 consisted of 3 person crews expeditions 7 to 12 were reduced to the safe minimum of two following the destruction of the nasa shuttle columbia from expedition 13 the crew gradually increased to 6 around 2010 with the arrival of the american commercial crew vehicles in the middle of the 2010s expedition size may be increased to seven crew members the number iss is designed for
gennady padalka member of expeditions 9 19/20 31/32 and 43/44 and commander of expedition 11 has spent more time in space than anyone else a total of 878 days 11 hours and 29 minutes peggy whitson has spent the most time in space of any american totaling 665 days 22 hours and 22 minutes during her time on expeditions 5 16 and 50/51/52
travellers who pay for their own passage into space are termed spaceflight participants by roscosmos and nasa and are sometimes referred to as space tourists a term they generally dislike all seven were transported to the iss on russian soyuz spacecraft when professional crews change over in numbers not divisible by the three seats in a soyuz and a short-stay crewmember is not sent the spare seat is sold by mircorp through space adventures when the space shuttle retired in 2011 and the stations crew size was reduced to 6 space tourism was halted as the partners relied on russian transport seats for access to the station soyuz flight schedules increase after 2013 allowing 5 soyuz flights 15 seats with only two expeditions 12 seats required the remaining seats are sold for around us40 million to members of the public who can pass a medical exam esa and nasa criticised private spaceflight at the beginning of the iss and nasa initially resisted training dennis tito the first man to pay for his own passage to the iss
anousheh ansari became the first iranian in space and the first self-funded woman to fly to the station officials reported that her education and experience make her much more than a tourist and her performance in training had been excellent ansari herself dismisses the idea that she is a tourist she did russian and european studies involving medicine and microbiology during her 10-day stay the documentary space tourists follows her journey to the station where she fulfilled an age-old dream of man to leave our planet as a normal person and travel into outer space
in 2008 spaceflight participant richard garriott placed a geocache aboard the iss during his flight this is currently the only non-terrestrial geocache in existence at the same time the immortality drive an electronic record of eight digitised human dna sequences was placed aboard the iss


 orbit 

the iss is maintained in a nearly circular orbit with a minimum mean altitude of 330 km 205 mi and a maximum of 410 km 255 mi in the centre of the thermosphere at an inclination of 51.6 degrees to earths equator necessary to ensure that russian soyuz and progress spacecraft launched from the baikonur cosmodrome may be safely launched to reach the station spent rocket stages must be dropped into uninhabited areas and this limits the directions rockets can be launched from the spaceport it travels at an average speed of 27,724 kilometres per hour 17,227 mph and completes 15.54 orbits per day 93 minutes per orbit the stations altitude was allowed to fall around the time of each nasa shuttle mission orbital boost burns would generally be delayed until after the shuttles departure this allowed shuttle payloads to be lifted with the stations engines during the routine firings rather than have the shuttle lift itself and the payload together to a higher orbit this trade-off allowed heavier loads to be transferred to the station after the retirement of the nasa shuttle the nominal orbit of the space station was raised in altitude other more frequent supply ships do not require this adjustment as they are substantially lighter vehicles
orbital boosting can be performed by the stations two main engines on the zvezda service module or russian or european spacecraft docked to zvezdas aft port the atv has been designed with the possibility of adding a second docking port to its other end allowing it to remain at the iss and still allow other craft to dock and boost the station it takes approximately two orbits three hours for the boost to a higher altitude to be completed maintaining iss altitude uses about 7.5 tonnes of chemical fuel per annum at an annual cost of about 210 million
in december 2008 nasa signed an agreement with the ad astra rocket company which may result in the testing on the iss of a vasimr plasma propulsion engine this technology could allow station-keeping to be done more economically than at present
the russian orbital segment contains the data management system which handles guidance navigation and control ros gnc for the entire station initially zarya the first module of the station controlled the station until a short time after the russian service module zvezda docked and was transferred control zvezda contains the esa built dms-r data management system using two fault-tolerant computers ftc zvezda computes the stations position and orbital trajectory using redundant earth horizon sensors solar horizon sensors as well as sun and star trackers the ftcs each contain three identical processing units working in parallel and provide advanced fault-masking by majority voting


 orientation 
zvezda uses gyroscopes and thrusters to turn itself around gyroscopes do not require propellant rather they use electricity to store momentum in flywheels by turning in the opposite direction to the stations movement the usos has its own computer controlled gyroscopes to handle the extra mass of that section when gyroscopes saturate thrusters are used to cancel out the stored momentum during expedition 10 an incorrect command was sent to the stations computer using about 14 kilograms of propellant before the fault was noticed and fixed when attitude control computers in the ros and usos fail to communicate properly it can result in a rare force fight where the ros gnc computer must ignore the usos counterpart which has no thrusters when an atv nasa shuttle or soyuz is docked to the station it can also be used to maintain station attitude such as for troubleshooting shuttle control was used exclusively during installation of the s3s4 truss which provides electrical power and data interfaces for the stations electronics


 mission controls 
the components of the iss are operated and monitored by their respective space agencies at mission control centres across the globe including
roscosmoss mission control center at korolyov moscow oblast controls the russian orbital segment which handles guidance navigation and control for the entire station in addition to individual soyuz and progress missions
esas atv control centre at the toulouse space centre cst in toulouse france controls flights of the unmanned european automated transfer vehicle
jaxas jem control center and htv control center at tsukuba space center tksc in tsukuba japan are responsible for operating the kibō complex and all flights of the white stork htv cargo spacecraft respectively
nasas mission control center at lyndon b johnson space center in houston texas serves as the primary control facility for the united states segment of the iss and also controlled the space shuttle missions that visited the station
nasas payload operations and integration center at marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama coordinates payload operations in the usos
esas columbus control centre at the german aerospace centre dlr in oberpfaffenhofen germany manages the european columbus research laboratory
csas mss control at saint-hubert quebec canada controls and monitors the mobile servicing system or canadarm2


 repairs 

orbital replacement units orus are spare parts that can be readily replaced when a unit either passes its design life or fails examples of orus are pumps storage tanks controller boxes antennas and battery units some units can be replaced using robotic arms many are stored outside the station either on small pallets called express logistics carriers elcs or share larger platforms called external stowage platforms which also hold science experiments both kinds of pallets have electricity as many parts which could be damaged by the cold of space require heating the larger logistics carriers also have computer local area network connections lan and telemetry to connect experiments a heavy emphasis on stocking the usos with orus occurred around 2011 before the end of the nasa shuttle programme as its commercial replacements cygnus and dragon carry one tenth to one quarter the payload

unexpected problems and failures have impacted the stations assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and in some cases could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons had these problems not been resolved during sts-120 in 2007 following the relocation of the p6 truss and solar arrays it was noted during the redeployment of the array that it had become torn and was not deploying properly an eva was carried out by scott parazynski assisted by douglas wheelock the men took extra precautions to reduce the risk of electric shock as the repairs were carried out with the solar array exposed to sunlight the issues with the array were followed in the same year by problems with the starboard solar alpha rotary joint sarj which rotates the arrays on the starboard side of the station excessive vibration and high-current spikes in the array drive motor were noted resulting in a decision to substantially curtail motion of the starboard sarj until the cause was understood inspections during evas on sts-120 and sts-123 showed extensive contamination from metallic shavings and debris in the large drive gear and confirmed damage to the large metallic race ring at the heart of the joint and so the joint was locked to prevent further damage repairs to the joint were carried out during sts-126 with lubrication of both joints and the replacement of 11 out of 12 trundle bearings on the joint
2009 saw damage to the s1 radiator one of the components of the stations cooling system the problem was first noticed in soyuz imagery in september 2008 but was not thought to be serious the imagery showed that the surface of one sub-panel has peeled back from the underlying central structure possibly because of micro-meteoroid or debris impact it is also known that a service module thruster cover jettisoned during an eva in 2008 had struck the s1 radiator but its effect if any has not been determined on 15 may 2009 the damaged radiator panels ammonia tubing was mechanically shut off from the rest of the cooling system by the computer-controlled closure of a valve the same valve was used immediately afterwards to vent the ammonia from the damaged panel eliminating the possibility of an ammonia leak from the cooling system via the damaged panel
early on 1 august 2010 a failure in cooling loop a starboard side one of two external cooling loops left the station with only half of its normal cooling capacity and zero redundancy in some systems the problem appeared to be in the ammonia pump module that circulates the ammonia cooling fluid several subsystems including two of the four cmgs were shut down
planned operations on the iss were interrupted through a series of evas to address the cooling system issue a first eva on 7 august 2010 to replace the failed pump module was not fully completed because of an ammonia leak in one of four quick-disconnects a second eva on 11 august successfully removed the failed pump module a third eva was required to restore loop a to normal functionality
the usoss cooling system is largely built by the american company boeing which is also the manufacturer of the failed pump
an air leak from the usos in 2004 the venting of fumes from an elektron oxygen generator in 2006 and the failure of the computers in the ros in 2007 during sts-117 left the station without thruster elektron vozdukh and other environmental control system operations the root cause of which was found to be condensation inside the electrical connectors leading to a short-circuit
the four main bus switching units mbsus located in the s0 truss control the routing of power from the four solar array wings to the rest of the iss in late 2011 mbsu-1 while still routing power correctly ceased responding to commands or sending data confirming its health and was scheduled to be swapped out at the next available eva in each mbsu two power channels feed 160v dc from the arrays to two dc-to-dc power converters ddcus that supply the 124v power used in the station a spare mbsu was already on board but 30 august 2012 eva failed to be completed when a bolt being tightened to finish installation of the spare unit jammed before electrical connection was secured the loss of mbsu-1 limits the station to 75% of its normal power capacity requiring minor limitations in normal operations until the problem can be addressed
on 5 september 2012 in a second 6 hr eva to replace mbsu-1 astronauts sunita williams and akihiko hoshide successfully restored the iss to 100% power
on 24 december 2013 astronauts made a rare christmas eve space walk installing a new ammonia pump for the stations cooling system the faulty cooling system had failed earlier in the month halting many of the stations science experiments astronauts had to brave a mini blizzard of ammonia while installing the new pump it was only the second christmas eve spacewalk in nasa history


 fleet operations 

a wide variety of manned and unmanned spacecraft have supported the stations activities more than 60 progress spacecraft including m-mim2 and m-so1 which installed modules and more than 40 soyuz spacecraft have flown to the iss 35 flights of the retired nasa space shuttle were made to the station there have been five european atv five japanese htv kounotori eight spacex dragon and four orbital atk cygnus flights

 docking 

all russian spacecraft and self-propelled modules are able to rendezvous and dock to the space station without human intervention using the kurs docking system radar allows these vehicles to detect and intercept iss from over 200 kilometres away the european atv uses star sensors and gps to determine its intercept course when it catches up it uses laser equipment to optically recognise zvezda along with the kurs system for redundancy crew supervise these craft but do not intervene except to send abort commands in emergencies the japanese h-ii transfer vehicle parks itself in progressively closer orbits to the station and then awaits approach commands from the crew until it is close enough for a robotic arm to grapple and berth the vehicle to the usos the american space shuttle was manually docked and on missions with a cargo container the container would be berthed to the station with the use of manual robotic arms berthed craft can transfer international standard payload racks japanese spacecraft berth for one to two months russian and european supply craft can remain at the iss for six months allowing great flexibility in crew time for loading and unloading of supplies and trash nasa shuttles could remain docked for 11–12 days

the american manual approach to docking allows greater initial flexibility and less complexity the downside to this mode of operation is that each mission becomes unique and requires specialised training and planning making the process more labour-intensive and expensive the russians pursued an automated methodology that used the crew in override or monitoring roles although the initial development costs were high the system has become very reliable with standardisations that provide significant cost benefits in repetitive routine operations an automated approach could allow assembly of modules orbiting other worlds prior to crew arrival
soyuz spacecraft used for crew rotation also serve as lifeboats for emergency evacuation they are replaced every six months and have been used once to remove excess crew after the columbia disaster expeditions require on average 2,722 kg of supplies and as of 9 march 2011 crews had consumed a total of around 22,000 meals soyuz crew rotation flights and progress resupply flights visit the station on average two and three times respectively each year with the atv and htv planned to visit annually from 2010 onwards cygnus and dragon were contracted to fly cargo to the station after retirement of the nasa shuttle
from 26 february 2011 to 7 march 2011 four of the governmental partners united states esa japan and russia had their spacecraft nasa shuttle atv htv progress and soyuz docked at the iss the only time this has happened to date on 25 may 2012 spacex became the worlds first privately held company to send cargo via the dragon spacecraft to the international space station


 launch and docking windows 
prior to a ships docking to the iss navigation and attitude control gnc is handed over to the ground control of the ships country of origin gnc is set to allow the station to drift in space rather than fire its thrusters or turn using gyroscopes the solar panels of the station are turned edge-on to the incoming ships so residue from its thrusters does not damage the cells when a nasa space shuttle docked to the station other ships were grounded as the shuttles reinforced carbon-carbon wing leading edges cameras windows and instruments were too much at risk from damage or contamination by thruster residue from other ships movements
approximately 30% of nasa shuttle launch delays were caused by poor weather occasional priority was given to the soyuz arrivals at the station where the soyuz carried crew with time-critical cargoes such as biological experiment materials also causing shuttle delays departure of the nasa shuttle was often delayed or prioritised according to weather over its two landing sites whilst the soyuz is capable of landing anywhere anytime its planned landing time and place is chosen to give consideration to helicopter pilots and ground recovery crew to give acceptable flying weather and lighting conditions soyuz launches occur in adverse weather conditions but the cosmodrome has been shut down on occasions when buried by snow drifts up to 6 metres in depth hampering ground operations


 life aboard 


 crew activities 

a typical day for the crew begins with a wake-up at 0600 followed by post-sleep activities and a morning inspection of the station the crew then eats breakfast and takes part in a daily planning conference with mission control before starting work at around 0810 the first scheduled exercise of the day follows after which the crew continues work until 1305 following a one-hour lunch break the afternoon consists of more exercise and work before the crew carries out its pre-sleep activities beginning at 1930 including dinner and a crew conference the scheduled sleep period begins at 2130 in general the crew works ten hours per day on a weekday and five hours on saturdays with the rest of the time their own for relaxation or work catch-up
the time zone used aboard the iss is coordinated universal time utc the windows are covered at night hours to give the impression of darkness because the station experiences 16 sunrises and sunsets per day during visiting space shuttle missions the iss crew mostly follows the shuttles mission elapsed time met which is a flexible time zone based on the launch time of the shuttle mission
the station provides crew quarters for each member of the expeditions crew with two sleep stations in the zvezda and four more installed in harmony the american quarters are private approximately person-sized soundproof booths the russian crew quarters include a small window but provide less ventilation and sound proofing a crew member can sleep in a crew quarter in a tethered sleeping bag listen to music use a laptop and store personal items in a large drawer or in nets attached to the modules walls the module also provides a reading lamp a shelf and a desktop visiting crews have no allocated sleep module and attach a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall it is possible to sleep floating freely through the station but this is generally avoided because of the possibility of bumping into sensitive equipment it is important that crew accommodations be well ventilated otherwise astronauts can wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide has formed around their heads


 food 

most of the food aboard is vacuum sealed in plastic bags cans are rare because they are heavy and expensive to transport preserved food is not highly regarded by the crew and taste is reduced in microgravity therefore effort is made to make the food more palatable such as using more spices than in regular cooking the crew looks forward to the arrival of any ships from earth as they bring fresh fruit and vegetables care is taken that foods do not create crumbs sauces are often used to avoid contaminating station equipment each crew member has individual food packages and cooks them using the on-board galley the galley features two food warmers a refrigerator added in november 2008 and a water dispenser that provides both heated and unheated water drinks are provided as dehydrated powder that is mixed with water before consumption drinks and soups are sipped from plastic bags with straws solid food is eaten with a knife and fork attached to a tray with magnets to prevent them from floating away any food that floats away including crumbs must be collected to prevent it from clogging the stations air filters and other equipment


 hygiene 

showers on space stations were introduced in the early 1970s on skylab and salyut 3 by salyut 6 in the early 1980s the crew complained of the complexity of showering in space which was a monthly activity the iss does not feature a shower instead crewmembers wash using a water jet and wet wipes with soap dispensed from a toothpaste tube-like container crews are also provided with rinseless shampoo and edible toothpaste to save water
there are two space toilets on the iss both of russian design located in zvezda and tranquility these waste and hygiene compartments use a fan-driven suction system similar to the space shuttle waste collection system astronauts first fasten themselves to the toilet seat which is equipped with spring-loaded restraining bars to ensure a good seal a lever operates a powerful fan and a suction hole slides open the air stream carries the waste away solid waste is collected in individual bags which are stored in an aluminium container full containers are transferred to progress spacecraft for disposal liquid waste is evacuated by a hose connected to the front of the toilet with anatomically correct urine funnel adapters attached to the tube so that men and women can use the same toilet the diverted urine is collected and transferred to the water recovery system where it is recycled into drinking water


 crew health and safety 


 radiation 
the iss is partially protected from the space environment by earths magnetic field from an average distance of about 70,000 km 43,000 mi depending on solar activity the magnetosphere begins to deflect solar wind around earth and iss solar flares are still a hazard to the crew who may receive only a few minutes warning in 2005 during the initial proton storm of an x-3 class solar flare the crew of expedition 10 took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the ros designed for this purpose

subatomic charged particles primarily protons from cosmic rays and solar wind are normally absorbed by earths atmosphere when they interact in sufficient quantity their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an aurora outside earths atmosphere crews are exposed to about 1 millisievert each day which is about a year of natural exposure on earth this results in a higher risk of cancer for astronauts radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the dna and chromosomes of lymphocytes these cells are central to the immune system and so any damage to them could contribute to the lower immunity experienced by astronauts radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in astronauts protective shielding and drugs may lower risks to an acceptable level
radiation levels on the iss are about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew earths electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other radiation in low earth orbit as in the stratosphere for example on a 12-hour flight an airline passenger would experience 0.1 millisieverts of radiation or a rate of 0.2 millisieverts per day only 1/5 the rate experienced by an astronaut in leo additionally airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight while iss crew are exposed for their whole stay


 stress 

there is considerable evidence that psychosocial stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance cosmonaut valery ryumin wrote in his journal during a particularly difficult period on board the salyut 6 space station all the conditions necessary for murder are met if you shut two men in a cabin measuring 18 feet by 20 and leave them together for two months
nasas interest in psychological stress caused by space travel initially studied when their manned missions began was rekindled when astronauts joined cosmonauts on the russian space station mir common sources of stress in early american missions included maintaining high performance under public scrutiny and isolation from peers and family the latter is still often a cause of stress on the iss such as when the mother of nasa astronaut daniel tani died in a car accident and when michael fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child
a study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks are a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment skylabs three crews remained one two and three months respectively long term crews on salyut 6 salyut 7 and the iss last about five to six months and mirs expeditions often lasted longer the iss working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak a different language first-generation space stations had crews who spoke a single language second and third-generation stations have crew from many cultures who speak many languages the iss is unique because visitors are not classed automatically into host or guest categories as with previous stations and spacecraft and may not suffer from feelings of isolation in the same way crew members with a military pilot background and those with an academic science background or teachers and politicians may have problems understanding each others jargon and worldview


 medical 

medical effects of long-term weightlessness include muscle atrophy deterioration of the skeleton osteopenia fluid redistribution a slowing of the cardiovascular system decreased production of red blood cells balance disorders and a weakening of the immune system lesser symptoms include loss of body mass and puffiness of the face
sleep is disturbed on the iss regularly because of mission demands such as incoming or departing ships sound levels in the station are unavoidably high because the atmosphere is unable to thermosiphon fans are required at all times to allow processing of the atmosphere which would stagnate in the freefall zero-g environment
to prevent some of these adverse physiological effects the station is equipped with two treadmills including the colbert and the ared advanced resistive exercise device which enables various weightlifting exercises which add muscle but do not compensate for or raise astronauts reduced bone density and a stationary bicycle each astronaut spends at least two hours per day exercising on the equipment astronauts use bungee cords to strap themselves to the treadmill


 microbiological environmental hazards 

hazardous moulds which can foul air and water filters may develop aboard space stations they can produce acids which degrade metal glass and rubber they can also be harmful for the crews health microbiological hazards have led to a development of the locad-pts that can identify common bacteria and moulds faster than standard methods of culturing which may require a sample to be sent back to earth as of 2012 76 types of unregulated micro-organisms have been detected on the iss
reduced humidity paint with mould-killing chemicals and antiseptic solutions can be used to prevent contamination in space stations all materials used in the iss are tested for resistance against fungi


 threat of orbital debris 

at the low altitudes at which the iss orbits there is a variety of space debris consisting of different objects including entire spent rocket stages defunct satellites explosion fragments—including materials from anti-satellite weapon tests paint flakes slag from solid rocket motors and coolant released by us-a nuclear-powered satellites these objects in addition to natural micrometeoroids are a significant threat large objects could destroy the station but are less of a threat because their orbits can be predicted objects too small to be detected by optical and radar instruments from approximately 1 cm down to microscopic size number in the trillions despite their small size some of these objects are a threat because of their kinetic energy and direction in relation to the station spacesuits of spacewalking crew could puncture causing exposure to vacuum
ballistic panels also called micrometeorite shielding are incorporated into the station to protect pressurised sections and critical systems the type and thickness of these panels depends on their predicted exposure to damage the stations shields and structure have different designs on the ros and the usos on the usos a thin aluminium sheet is held apart from the hull and causes objects to shatter into a cloud before hitting the hull thereby spreading the energy of impact on the ros a carbon plastic honeycomb screen is spaced from the hull an aluminium honeycomb screen is spaced from that with a screen-vacuum thermal insulation covering and glass cloth over the top it is about 50% less likely to be punctured and crew move to the ros when the station is under threat punctures on the ros would be contained within the panels which are 70 cm square

space debris is tracked remotely from the ground and the station crew can be notified this allows for a debris avoidance manoeuvre dam to be conducted which uses thrusters on the russian orbital segment to alter the stations orbital altitude avoiding the debris dams are not uncommon taking place if computational models show the debris will approach within a certain threat distance eight dams had been performed prior to march 2009 the first seven between october 1999 and may 2003 usually the orbit is raised by one or two kilometres by means of an increase in orbital velocity of the order of 1 ms unusually there was a lowering of 1.7 km on 27 august 2008 the first such lowering for 8 years there were two dams in 2009 on 22 march and 17 july if a threat from orbital debris is identified too late for a dam to be safely conducted the station crew close all the hatches aboard the station and retreat into their soyuz spacecraft so that they would be able to evacuate in the event the station was seriously damaged by the debris this partial station evacuation has occurred on 13 march 2009 28 june 2011 24 march 2012 and 16 june 2015


 end of mission 

according to a 2009 report space corporation energia is considering methods to remove from the station some modules of the russian orbital segment when the end of mission is reached and use them as a basis for a new station called the orbital piloted assembly and experiment complex opsek the modules under consideration for removal from the current iss include the multipurpose laboratory module nauka currently scheduled to be launched in mid-2018 and other russian modules which are planned to be attached to nauka afterwards those modules would be within their useful lives in 2016 or 2020 the report presents a statement from an unnamed russian engineer that based on the experience from mir a 30-year life should be possible except for micrometeorite damage because the russian modules have been built with on-orbit refurbishment in mind
according to the outer space treaty the united states and russia are legally responsible for all modules they have launched in iss planning nasa examined options including returning the station to earth via shuttle missions deemed too expensive as the usos is not designed for disassembly and this would require at least 27 shuttle missions natural orbital decay with random reentry similar to skylab boosting the station to a higher altitude which would delay reentry and a controlled targeted de-orbit to a remote ocean area
a controlled deorbit into a remote ocean was found to be technically feasible only with russias assistance the russian space agency has experience from de-orbiting the salyut 4 5 6 7 and mir space stations nasas first intentional controlled de-orbit of a satellite the compton gamma ray observatory occurred in 2000 as of late 2010 the preferred plan is to use a slightly modified progress spacecraft to de-orbit the iss this plan was seen as the simplest cheapest and with the highest margin skylab the only space station built and launched entirely by the us decayed from orbit slowly over 5 years and no attempt was made to de-orbit it using a deorbital burn remains of skylab hit populated areas of esperance western australia without injuries or loss of life
the exploration gateway platform a discussion by nasa and boeing at the end of 2011 suggested using leftover usos hardware and zvezda 2  sic as a refuelling depot and service station located at one of the earth-moon lagrange points l1 or l2 the entire usos cannot be reused and will be discarded but some russian modules are planned to be reused nauka the uzlovoy module two science power platforms and rassvet launched between 2010 and 2015 and joined to the ros may be separated to form opsek nauka will be used in the station whose main goal is supporting manned deep space exploration opsek will orbit at a higher inclination of 71 degrees allowing observation to and from all of the russian federation
in february 2015 roscosmos announced that it would remain a part of the iss programme until 2024 nine months earlier—in response to us sanctions against russia over the conflict in the crimea—russian deputy prime minister dmitry rogozin had stated that russia would reject a us request to prolong the orbiting stations use beyond 2020 and would only supply rocket engines to the us for non-military satellite launches
a proposed modification that would reuse some of the iss american and european segments is to attach a vasimr drive module to the vacated node with its own onboard power source this would allow long-term reliability testing of the concept for less cost than building a dedicated space station from scratch
on 28 march 2015 russian sources announced that roscosmos and nasa had agreed to collaborate on the development of a replacement for the current iss igor komarov the head of russias roscosmos made the announcement with nasa administrator charles bolden at his side komarov said roscosmos together with nasa will work on the programme of a future orbital station we agreed that the group of countries taking part in the iss project will work on the future project of a new orbital station the first step is that the iss will operate until 2024 and that roscosmos and nasa do not rule out that the stations flight could be extended in a statement provided to spacenews on 28 march nasa spokesman david weaver said the agency appreciated the russian commitment to extending the iss but did not confirm any plans for a future space station
on 30 september 2015 boeings contract with nasa as prime contractor for the iss was extended to 30 september 2020 part of boeings services under the contract will relate to extending the stations primary structural hardware past 2020 to the end of 2028
regarding extending the iss on 15 november 2016 general director vladimir solntsev of rsc energia stated maybe the iss will receive continued resources today we discussed the possibility of using the station until 2028 and much will depend on the political moments in relations with the americans with the new administration it will be discussed


 cost 
the iss has been described as the most expensive single item ever constructed in 2010 the cost was expected to be 150 billion this includes nasas budget of 58.7 billion inflation-unadjusted for the station from 1985 to 2015 72.4 billion in 2010 dollars russias 12 billion europes 5 billion japans 5 billion canadas 2 billion and the cost of 36 shuttle flights to build the station estimated at 1.4 billion each or 50.4 billion in total assuming 20,000 person-days of use from 2000 to 2015 by two- to six-person crews each person-day would cost 7.5 million less than half the inflation-adjusted 19.6 million 5.5 million before inflation per person-day of skylab

 sightings from earth 


 naked eye 
the iss is visible to the naked eye as a slow-moving bright white dot because of reflected sunlight and can be seen in the hours after sunset and before sunrise when the station remains sunlit but the ground and sky are dark the iss takes about 10 minutes to pass from one horizon to another and will only be visible part of that time because of moving into or out of the earths shadow because of the size of its reflective surface area the iss is the brightest artificial object in the sky excluding flares with an approximate maximum magnitude of −4 when overhead similar to venus the iss like many satellites including the iridium constellation can also produce flares of up to 8 or 16 times the brightness of venus as sunlight glints off reflective surfaces the iss is also visible in broad daylight albeit with a great deal more difficulty
tools are provided by a number of websites such as heavens-above see live viewing below as well as smartphone applications that use orbital data and the observers longitude and latitude to indicate when the iss will be visible weather permitting where the station will appear to rise the altitude above the horizon it will reach and the duration of the pass before the station disappears either by setting below the horizon or entering into earths shadow
in november 2012 nasa launched its spot the station service which sends people text and email alerts when the station is due to fly above their town the station is visible from 95% of the inhabited land on earth but is not visible from extreme northern or southern latitudes


 astrophotography 

using a telescope-mounted camera to photograph the station is a popular hobby for astronomers whilst using a mounted camera to photograph the earth and stars is a popular hobby for crew the use of a telescope or binoculars allows viewing of the iss during daylight hours
some amateur astronomers also use telescopic lenses to photograph the iss while it transits the sun sometimes doing so during an eclipse and so the sun moon and iss are all positioned approximatelly in a single line one example is during the 21 august solar eclipse where at one location in wyoming images of the iss were captured during the eclipse similar images were captured by nasa from a location in washington
parisian engineer and astrophotographer thierry legault known for his photos of spaceships transiting the sun travelled to oman in 2011 to photograph the sun moon and space station all lined up legault who received the marius jacquemetton award from the société astronomique de france in 1999 and other hobbyists use websites that predict when the iss will transit the sun or moon and from what location those passes will be visible
