the solar dynamo is the physical process that generates the suns magnetic field a dynamo essentially a naturally occurring electric generator in the suns interior produces electric currents and a magnetic field following the laws of ampère faraday and ohm as well as the laws of hydrodynamics which together form the laws of magnetohydrodynamics the detailed mechanism of the solar dynamo is not known and is the subject of current research


 mechanism 
a dynamo converts kinetic energy into electric-magnetic energy an electrically conducting fluid with shear or more complicated motion such as turbulence can temporarily amplify a magnetic field through lenzs law fluid motion relative to a magnetic field induces electric currents in the fluid that distort the initial field if the fluid motion is sufficiently complicated it can sustain its own magnetic field with advective fluid amplification essentially balancing diffusive or ohmic decay such systems are called self-sustaining dynamos the sun is a self-sustaining dynamo that converts convective motion and differential rotation within the sun to electric-magnetic energy


 solar cycle 

the most prominent time variation of the solar magnetic field is related to the quasi-periodic 11-year solar cycle characterized by an increasing and decreasing number and size of sunspots sunspots are visible as dark patches on the suns photosphere and correspond to concentrations of magnetic field at a typical solar minimum few or no sunspots are visible those that do appear are at high solar latitudes as the solar cycle progresses towards its maximum sunspots tend to form closer to the solar equator following spörers law
the 11-year sunspot cycle is half of a 22-year babcock–leighton solar dynamo cycle which corresponds to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields at solar-cycle maximum the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field generated through differential rotation within the tachocline is near its maximum strength at this point in the dynamo cycle buoyant upwelling within the convection zone forces emergence of the toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere giving rise to pairs of sunspots roughly aligned east–west with opposite magnetic polarities the magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle a phenomenon known as the hale cycle
during the solar cycle’s declining phase energy shifts from the internal toroidal magnetic field to the external poloidal field and sunspots diminish in number at solar minimum the toroidal field is correspondingly at minimum strength sunspots are relatively rare and the poloidal field is at maximum strength during the next cycle differential rotation converts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle the process carries on continuously and in an idealized simplified scenario each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change in the polarity of the suns large-scale magnetic field
