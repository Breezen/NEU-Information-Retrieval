in mathematics an annulus the latin word for little ring is anulusannulus with plural anuliannuli is a ring-shaped object a region bounded by two concentric circles the adjectival form is annular as in annular eclipse
the open annulus is topologically equivalent to both the open cylinder s1 × 0,1 and the punctured plane informally it has the shape of a hardware washer
the area of an annulus is the difference in the areas of the larger circle of radius r and the smaller one of radius r

the area of an annulus is determined by the length of the longest line segment within the annulus which is the chord tangent to the inner circle 2d in the accompanying diagram that can be shown using the pythagorean theorem since this line is tangent to the smaller circle and perpendicular to its radius at that point so d and r are sides of a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse r and the area of the annulus is given by

the area can also be obtained via calculus by dividing the annulus up into an infinite number of annuli of infinitesimal width dρ and area 2πρ dρ and then integrating from ρ  r to ρ  r

as a subset of the complex plane an annulus can be considered as a riemann surface the complex structure of an annulus depends only on the ratio rr each annulus anna r r can be holomorphically mapped to a standard one centered at the origin and with outer radius 1 by the map
