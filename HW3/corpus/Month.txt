a month is a unit of time used with calendars which is approximately as long as a natural period related to the motion of the moon month and moon are cognates the traditional concept arose with the cycle of moon phases such months lunations are synodic months and last approximately 29.53 days from excavated tally sticks researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the moons phases as early as the paleolithic age synodic months based on the moons orbital period with respect to the earth-sun line are still the basis of many calendars today and are used to divide the year


 types of months in astronomy 

the following types of months are mainly of significance in astronomy most of them but not the distinction between sidereal and tropical months first recognized in babylonian lunar astronomy
the sidereal month is defined as the moons orbital period in a non-rotating frame of reference which on average is equal to its rotation period in the same frame it is about 27.32166 days 27 days 7 hours 43 minutes 11.6 seconds it is closely equal to the time it takes the moon to pass twice a fixed star different stars give different results because all have a very small proper motion and are not really fixed in position
a synodic month is the most familiar lunar cycle defined as the time interval between two consecutive occurrences of a particular phase such as new moon or full moon as seen by an observer on earth the mean length of the synodic month is 29.53059 days 29 days 12 hours 44 minutes 2.8 seconds due to the eccentricity of the lunar orbit around earth and to a lesser degree the earths elliptical orbit around the sun the length of a synodic month can vary by up to seven hours
the tropical month is the average time for the moon to pass twice through the same equinox point of the sky it is 27.32158 days very slightly shorter than the sidereal month 27.32166 days because of precession of the equinoxes
an anomalistic month is the average time the moon takes to go from perigee to perigee - the point in the moons orbit when it is closest to earth an anomalistic month is about 27.55455 days on average
the draconic month draconitic month or nodal month is the period in which the moon returns to the same node of its orbit the nodes are the two points where the moons orbit crosses the plane of the earths orbit its duration is about 27.21222 days on average
a synodic month is longer than a sidereal month because the earth-moon system is orbiting the sun in the same direction as the moon is orbiting the earth the sun moves eastward with respect to the stars as does the moon and it takes about 2.2 days longer for the moon to return to the same apparent position with respect to the sun
an anomalistic month is longer than a sidereal month because the perigee moves in the same direction as the moon is orbiting the earth one revolution in nine years therefore the moon takes a little longer to return to perigee than to return to the same star
a draconic month is shorter than a sidereal month because the nodes move in the opposite direction as the moon is orbiting the earth one revolution in 18.6 years therefore the moon returns to the same node slightly earlier than it returns to the same star


 calendrical consequences 

at the simplest level most well-known lunar calendars are based on the initial approximation that 2 lunations last 59 days a 30-day full month followed by a 29-day hollow month — but this is only roughly accurate and eventually needs correction by using larger cycles or the equivalent of leap days additionally the synodic month does not fit easily into the year which makes accurate rule-based lunisolar calendars complicated the most common solution to this problem is the metonic cycle which takes advantage of the fact that 235 lunations are approximately 19 tropical years which add up to not quite 6940 days however a metonic calendar will drift against the seasons by about 1 day every 200 years metonic calendars include the calendar used in the antikythera mechanism about 2000 years ago and the hebrew calendar
the complexity required in an accurate lunisolar calendar may explain why solar calendars which have months which no longer relate to the phase of the moon but are based only on the motion of the sun relative to the equinoxes and solstices have generally replaced lunar calendars for civil use in most societies


 months in various calendars 


 beginning of the lunar month 
the hellenic calendars the hebrew lunisolar calendar and the islamic lunar calendar started the month with the first appearance of the thin crescent of the new moon
however the motion of the moon in its orbit is very complicated and its period is not constant the date and time of this actual observation depends on the exact geographical longitude as well as latitude atmospheric conditions the visual acuity of the observers etc therefore the beginning and lengths of months defined by observation cannot be accurately predicted
while some like the jewish karaites still rely on actual moon observations most people use the gregorian solar calendar
pingelapese a language from micronesia also uses a lunar calendar there are 12 months associated with their calendar the moon first appears in march they name this month kahlek this system has been used for hundreds of years and throughout many generations this calendar is cyclical and relies on the position and shape of the moon


 julian and gregorian calendars 
the gregorian calendar like the julian calendar before it has twelve months

the mean month length of the gregorian calendar is 30.436875 days
months existing in the roman calendar in the past include
the mensis intercalaris an occasional month after february to realign the calendar
quintilis renamed to july in honour of julius caesar
sextilis renamed to august in honour of augustus
the famous mnemonic thirty days hath september is the most common way of teaching the lengths of the months in the english-speaking world
also note that any five consecutive months not including february contain 153 days
the knuckles of the four fingers of ones hand and the spaces between them can be used to remember the lengths of the months by making a fist each month will be listed as one proceeds across the hand all months landing on a knuckle are 31 days long and those landing between them are not when the knuckle of the index finger is reached july go back to the first knuckle or over to the first knuckle on the other fist held next to the first and continue with august this physical mnemonic has been taught to primary school students for many decades
this cyclical pattern of month lengths matches the musical keyboard alternation of white and black keys with the note f correlating to the month of january


 calends nones and ides 
the ides occur on the thirteenth day in eight of the months but in march may july and october they occur on the fifteenth the nones always occur 8 days one roman week before the ides ie on the fifth or the seventh the calends are always the first day of the month and before julius caesars reform fell sixteen days two roman weeks after the ides except the ides of february and the intercalary month


 hebrew calendar 
the hebrew calendar has 12 or 13 months
