alfred kleiner april 24 1849 – july 3 1916 was a swiss physicist and professor of experimental physics at the university of zurich he was albert einsteins doctoral advisor or doktorvater initially einsteins advisor was heinrich f weber however they had a major falling out and einstein chose to switch to kleiner


 education 
he received his phd in 1874 from the university of zurich for a thesis entitled zur theorie der intermittirenden netzhautreizung on the theory of intermittent retinal irritation under johann jakob müller


 career 
alfred kleiner was professor of physics at the university of zurich he also held several other positions and titles throughout his career including privatdozent private lecturer in 1870 ausserordentlicher professor associate professor in 1880 ordentlicher professor full professor in 1885 rektor chancellor from 1908 to 1910 honorarprofessor emeritus professor in 1915 and privatdozent from 1875 to 1885 at the swiss federal institute of technology also called eidgenössische technische hochschule zürich or eth the polytechnikum also at zurich
in the early 1890s with his students fritz laager and theordor erismann kleiner conducted experiments to determine if changes in gravitational attraction could be caused by shielding no effect greater than the experimental error was observed kleiner published his results on this in 1905 laager in 1904 and erismann in 1908 and 1911 their work on this was motivated by the papers by louis winslow austin and charles burton thwing


 einstein and kleiner 
einstein’s controversy with paul drude took place in the middle of 1901 it was at this time that einstein transitioned from weber to kleiner and changed his dissertation topic from thermoelectricity to molecular kinetics
until 1909 the eth was not authorized to grant doctoral degrees so a special arrangement enabled eth students to obtain doctorates from the university of zurich at that time most dissertations in physics by eth students were carried out under the supervision of hf weber einstein’s former teacher at the polytechnikum as it was then called the university of zurich had only one physics chair held by alfred kleiner his main research was focused on measuring instruments but he also had an interest in the foundations of physics
in letters to mileva maric einstein noted the frequent discussions that he had with kleiner on a wide range of topics on 19 december 1901 einstein writes to marić that he had
spent the whole afternoon with kleiner in zurich and explained my ideas on the electrodynamics of moving bodies to him he advised me to publish my ideas about the electromagnetic theory of light for moving bodies together with the experimental method he found the experimental method proposed by me to be the simplest and most appropriate one conceivable  i shall most certainly write the paper in the coming weeks
einstein also showed kleiner his first phd thesis dissertation in november 1901 however einstein withdrew his dissertation in february 1902 one year later he considered giving up his plan to obtain a doctorate and noted to his friend michele besso that the whole comedy has become tiresome for me
by march 1903 einstein had changed his mind indeed a letter to besso contains some of the central ideas of the 1905 dissertation kleiner was of course one of the two faculty reviewers of the dissertation submitted by einstein to the university on 20 july 1905 kleiners judgement of the dissertation was very positive the arguments and calculations to be carried out are among the most difficult in hydrodynamics the other reviewer heinrich burkhardt professor for mathematics at the university added the mode of treatment demonstrates fundamental mastery of the relevant mathematical methods
in his biography of einstein carl seelig reports einstein later laughingly recounted that his dissertation was first returned by kleiner with the comment that it was too short after he had added a single sentence it was accepted without further comment
einsteins earlier statistical physics papers from 1902 to 1904 developed the foundations of a theoretical approach that he applied to concrete problems in 1905 and in subsequent years his approach combined skepticism about classical mechanics with a firm belief in molecules and a confidence in statistical principles however einsteins phd thesis does not follow this statistical approach it has been argued that einstein avoided his own theoretical ideas to win the approval of his phd advisor alfred kleiner
in 1905 einstein obtained his doctorate from the university of zurich under alfred kleiner with the thesis entitled eine neue bestimmung der moleküldimensionen a new determination of the molecular dimensions after einstein concluded a 1909 lecture at the university of zurich on electrodynamics and relativity alfred kleiner suggested the possibility of a position at the university to einstein and recommended him for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics on may 7 1909 the regierungsrat des kantons zürich appointed einstein as an associate professor effective from the october 15 1909 with a salary of 4,500 swiss francs per annum
