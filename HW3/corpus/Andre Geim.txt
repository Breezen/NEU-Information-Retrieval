sir andre konstantin geim frs honfrsc honfinstp born 21 october 1958 is a soviet-born dutch-british physicist working in the school of physics and astronomy at the university of manchester
geim was awarded the 2010 nobel prize in physics jointly with konstantin novoselov for his work on graphene he is regius professor of physics and royal society research professor at the manchester centre for mesoscience and nanotechnology
in addition to the 2010 nobel prize he received an ig nobel prize in 2000 for using the magnetic properties of water scaling to levitate a small frog with magnets this makes him the first and thus far only person to receive both the prestigious science award and its tongue-in-cheek equivalent


 education 
andre geim was born to konstantin alekseyevich geim and nina nikolayevna bayer in sochi on 21 october 1958 both his parents were engineers of german origin in 1965 the family moved to nalchik where he studied at a high school after graduation he applied to the moscow engineering physics institute he took the entrance exams twice but attributes his failure to qualify to discrimination on account of his german ethnicity he then applied to the moscow institute of physics and technology mipt where he was accepted
he said that at the time he would not have chosen to study solid-state physics preferring particle physics or astrophysics but is now happy with his choice he received a diplom msc degree equivalent from mipt in 1982 and a candidate of sciences phd equivalent degree in metal physics in 1987 from the institute of solid state physics issp at the russian academy of sciences ras in chernogolovka


 academic career 
after earning his phd with victor petrashov geim worked as a research scientist at the institute for microelectronics technology imt at ras and from 1990 as a post-doctoral fellow at the universities of nottingham twice bath and copenhagen he said that while at nottingham he could spend his time on research rather than swimming through soviet treacle and determined to leave the soviet union
he obtained his first tenured position in 1994 when he was appointed associate professor at radboud university nijmegen where he did work on mesoscopic superconductivity he later gained dutch citizenship one of his doctoral students at nijmegen was konstantin novoselov who went on to become his main research partner however geim has said that he had an unpleasant time during his academic career in the netherlands
he was offered professorships at nijmegen and eindhoven but turned them down as he found the dutch academic system too hierarchical and full of petty politicking this can be pretty unpleasant at times he says its not like the british system where every staff member is an equal quantity on the other hand geim writes in his nobel lecture that in addition the situation was a bit surreal because outside the university walls i received a warm-hearted welcome from everyone around including jan kees and other academics prof jan kees maan was the research boss of geim during his time at radboud university nijmegen
in 2001 he became a professor of physics at the university of manchester and was appointed director of the manchester centre for mesoscience and nanotechnology in 2002 geims wife and long-standing co-author irina grigorieva also moved to manchester as a lecturer in 2001 the same year they were joined by novoselov who moved to manchester from nijmegen which awarded him a phd in 2004 geim served as langworthy professor between 2007 and 2013 leaving this endowed professorship to novoselov in 2012 also between 2007 and 2010 geim was an epsrc senior research fellow before becoming one of royal society research professors
in 2010 radboud university nijmegen appointed him professor of innovative materials and nanoscience extending geims long list of honorary professorships


 research 

geims achievements include the discovery of a simple method for isolating single atomic layers of graphite known as graphene in collaboration with researchers at the university of manchester and imt the team published their findings in october 2004 in science
graphene consists of one-atom-thick layers of carbon atoms arranged in two-dimensional hexagons and is the thinnest material in the world as well as one of the strongest and hardest the material has many potential applications
geim said one of the first applications of graphene could be in the development of flexible touchscreens and that he has not patented the material because he would need a specific application and an industrial partner

geim was involved in the development of a biomimetic adhesive which became known as gecko tape—so called because of the adhesiveness of gecko feet—research of which is still in the early stages it is hoped that the development will eventually allow humans to scale ceilings like spider-man
geims research in 1997 into the possible effects of magnetism on water scaling led to the famous discovery of direct diamagnetic levitation of water and led to a frog being levitated for this experiment he and michael berry received the 2000 ig nobel prize we were asked first whether we dared to accept this prize and i take pride in our sense of humor and self-deprecation that we did
geim has also carried out research on mesoscopic physics and superconductivity
he said of the range of subjects he has studied many people choose a subject for their phd and then continue the same subject until they retire i despise this approach i have changed my subject five times before i got my first tenured position and that helped me to learn different subjects
geims research has been funded by the engineering and physical sciences research council epsrc
he named his favourite hamster hams ter tisha co-author in a 2001 research paper


 honours and awards 

geim shared the 2000 ig nobel prize in physics with michael berry for the frog experiment in 2006 he appeared on the scientific american 50 the institute of physics awarded him the 2007 mott medal and prize for his discovery of a new class of materials—free-standing two-dimensional crystals—in particular graphene geim was elected a fellow of the royal society frs in 2007 his certificate of election reads
he shared the 2008 eps europhysics prize with novoselov for discovering and isolating a single free-standing atomic layer of carbon graphene and elucidating its remarkable electronic properties in 2009 he received the körber european science award the us national academy of sciences honoured him with the 2010 john j carty award for the advancement of science for his experimental realisation and investigation of graphene the two-dimensional form of carbon he was awarded one of six royal society 2010 anniversary research professorships the royal society added its 2010 hughes medal for his revolutionary discovery of graphene and elucidation of its remarkable properties he was awarded honorary doctorates from delft university of technology eth zürich the university of antwerp and the university of manchester in 2010 geim was appointed as knight commander of the order of the netherlands lion for his contribution to dutch science
in 2011 geim became a corresponding member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences he is honorary professor of moscow phys-tech honorary professor of the university of nijmegen honorary fellow of the institute of physics honfinstp honorary fellow of the royal society of chemistry honfrsc honorary fellow of singapore institute of physics honorary professor of the chinese academy of sciences geim was furthermore made a knight bachelor in the 2012 new year honours for services to science he was elected a foreign associate of the us national academy of sciences in may 2012 he was awarded the copley medal in 2013 and the carbon medal in 2016


 nobel prize in physics 

on 5 october 2010 geim was awarded the 2010 nobel prize in physics jointly with novoselov for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene upon hearing of the award he said im fine i slept well i didnt expect the nobel prize this year and that his plans for the day would not change the lecture for the award took place on 8 december 2010 at stockholm university he said he hopes that graphene and other two-dimensional crystals will change everyday life as plastics did for humanity
a colleague of geim said that his award shows that people can still win a nobel by mucking about in a lab the award made him the first person to win as an individual both a nobel prize and an ig nobel prize on winning both a nobel and ig nobel he has stated that

frankly i value both my ig nobel prize and nobel prize at the same level and for me ig nobel prize was the manifestation that i can take jokes a little bit of self-deprecation always helps


 personal life 


 view and opinions 
geim was one of 38 nobel laureates who signed a declaration in 2010 issued by scholars for peace in the middle east condemning international attempts to boycott israeli academics institutions and research centers
at the nobel minds symposium in december 2010 geim said the nobel peace prize committees choice of chinese dissident the imprisoned liu xiaobo as winner of the nobel peace prize was patronising saying look at the people who give this nobel prize they are retired norwegian politicians who have spent all their careers in a safe environment in an oil-rich modern country they try to extend their views of the world how the world should work and how democracy works in another country its very very patronising— they have not lived in these countries in the past 10 years china has developed not only economically but even the strongest human rights supporter would agree also human rights have improved why do we need to distort this
geim has written several opinion pieces for the financial times examples of which can be found on his university webpage
in 2014 geims interview for desert island discs a popular bbc radio programme revealed details of his personal life and taste in music


 identity 
geim has a complex ancestry which is described in detail in his nobel prize autobiography in there geim has stated that most of his family are ethnic germans where his father descended from volga germans and his mother was mostly an ethnic german as well both his father and paternal grandfather had spent many years of their lives as prisoners in siberia in stalins gulags and some of the family had been prisoners in german concentration camps he also states that he suffered from anti-semitism in russia because my name sounds jewish
geim summarises his identity as follows to the best of my knowledge the only jew in the family was my great-grandmother with the rest on both sides being german having lived and worked in several european countries i consider myself european and do not believe that any further taxonomy is necessary especially in such a fluid world as the world of science
