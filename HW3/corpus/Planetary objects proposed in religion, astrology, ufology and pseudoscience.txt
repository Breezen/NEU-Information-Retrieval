there are a number of planets or moons whose existence is not supported by scientific evidence but are proposed by various astrologers pseudoscientists conspiracy theorists or certain religious groups


 lilith 

lilith is a hypothetical second moon of earth supposedly about the same mass as the earths moon proposed in 1918 by astrologer walter gorn old who called himself sepharial sepharial applied the name lilith from medieval jewish legend where she is described as the first wife of adam sepharial claimed that lilith was the same second moon that scientist georg waltemath claimed to have discovered twenty years earlier sepharial also claimed to be the first person in history to observe waltemaths moon as it crossed the sun and rationalized that it was too dark to be otherwise visually detected
sepharials comments ignored the fact that waltemaths proposed moon had already been discredited by the scientific community at the turn of the century there are many readily apparent holes in the arguments supporting liliths existence and the existence of this astronomical object is believed only by fringe groups
in present-day astrology the name lilith is usually given to a point on the horoscope that represents the direction of the actual moons apogee unrelated to the hypothetical second moon when considered as a point this lilith is sometimes defined as the second focus of the ellipse described by the moons orbit the earth is the first focus and the apogee lies in the same direction it takes 8 years and 10 months to complete its circuit around the zodiac


 planets proposed by l ron hubbard 
l ron hubbard the founder of scientology proposed as part of his cosmology a galactic confederacy which consisted of 26 stars and 76 planets including earth which was then known as teegeeack one planet in the scientology doctrine is known as helatrobus


 ummo 
ummo or ummoism is a series of decades-long claims that aliens from the planet ummo were communicating with people on the earth most ummo information was in the form of detailed documents and letters sent to various esoteric groups or ufo enthusiasts the ummo affair was subject to much mainstream attention in france and spain during the 1960s through the 1970s and a degree of interest remains regarding the subject general consensus is that ummoism was an elaborate hoax the culprit or culprits is unknown but a josé luis jordán peña has claimed responsibility for instigating ummoism however there are still a few small groups of devotees such as a strange bolivian cult called the daughters of ummo
jacques vallée has said that the authors of the ummo documents might be a real-world analogue of the fictional creators of borges tlön uqbar orbis tertius historian mike dash writes that ummoism began on february 6 1966 in madrid on that day jordán peña claimed to have had a close encounter of the first kind when he saw an enormous circular object with three legs and on its underside a curious symbol three vertical lines joined by a horizontal bar the two exterior lines curved outward at the edges which made the pictogram resemble the alchemical sign for the planet uranus dash 299
peñas report generated a fair amount of excitement but it was only the beginning not long afterwards a madrid author of a ufo book received several photographs in an anonymous mailing the photos were of a craft similar to the one reported by peña and bearing the same symbol within a few weeks a leading spanish contactee named fernando sesma manzano became involved when he began receiving lengthy typewritten documents which purported to come from a spacefaring race called the ummites dash 299 within the year various persons mostly in madrid received about 150 ummite documents totaling over 1000 pages every page of ummite documents was stamped with the same symbol of three linked lines new ummite documents would continue surfacing for many subsequent years many others have received ummo letters including french scientist jean-pierre petit a researcher at the cnrs
in june 2002 a scientist with the pseudonym jean pollion released in french his book ummo de vrais extraterrestres or ummo real extraterrestrials in which he analyses the ummite thoughts and language he shows that the ummo language is different from any other language we know in that it is a functional language one of the astonishing properties of this language according to the author is that it works without a dictionary one must only know 18 symbols that pollion has named soncepts which if combined make up a functional description of the thing or situation that the creator of the word is trying to convey currently more than 1300 pages of those letters have been registered but it is possible that many other letters exist in a 1988 letter reference is made to the existence of 3850 pages copies of which have been sent to several individuals representing perhaps up to 160,000 pages of total ummo documents the true identity of the authors of those reports remains unknown
dash notes that few ufologists outside spain took ummoism seriously—the photographic evidence was highly suspect and while the ummite letters were more sophisticated than most contactee communication there was nothing in them that could not have originated on earth still dash allows that whatever their origins considerable effort had gone into the supposed hoax dash 299
many scientific subjects are described in detail in the letters including network theory or graph theory astrophysics cosmology the unified field theory biology and evolution some of this information is thought to be dubious pseudoscience but much of it is scientifically accurate however jerome clark clark 1993 notes that jacques vallée argued that the scientific content of the ummo letters was knowledgeable but unremarkable and compared the scientific references to a well-researched science fiction novel—plausible in the 1960s but dated by the standards of the 1990s controversy arose about one particular assertion of the ummites in 1965 they wrote they were coming from a planet orbiting wolf 424 adding this star is 3.68502 light-years of the sun this was consistent with the distance estimated in 1938 but after some additional measurements the estimate was revised to 14.3 light-years fernando sesma asked then the ummites about this apparent mistake the ummites replied in another letter the same year that the first measurement is the real distance measured in the three-dimensional framework while the second is the apparent distance traveled by light


 planets proposed by zecharia sitchin 

the work of zecharia sitchin has garnered much attention among ufologists ancient astronaut theorists and conspiracy theorists he claimed to have uncovered through his retranslations of sumerian texts evidence that the human race was visited by a group of extraterrestrials from a distant planet in the solar system part of his theory lay in an astronomical interpretation of the babylonian creation myth the enuma elish in which he replaced the names of gods with hypothetical planets however since the principal evidence for sitchins claims lay in his own personally derived etymologies and not on any scholarly agreed interpretations academics consider it pseudoscience and pseudohistory if they know it at all
sitchins theory proposes the planets tiamat and nibiru tiamat supposedly existed between mars and jupiter he postulated that it was a thriving world in a very different planetary system with jungles and oceans whose orbit was disrupted by the arrival of a large planet or very small star less than twenty times the size of jupiter which passed through the planetary system between 65 million and four billion years ago the new orbits caused tiamat to collide with one of the moons of this object which is known as nibiru the debris from this collision are thought by the theorys proponents to have variously formed the asteroid belt the moon and the current inclination of the planet earth
sitchin claims that the babylonians associated nibiru with the god marduk the word is akkadian and the meaning is uncertain sitchin hypothesized it as a planet in a highly elliptic orbit around the sun with a perihelion passage some 3,600 years ago and assumed orbital period of about 3,750 years he also claimed it was the home of a technologically advanced human-like alien race the anunnaki who apparently visited earth in search of gold these beings eventually created humanity by genetically crossing themselves with extant primates and thus became the first gods
beginning in 1995 websites such as zetatalk have claimed that nibiru or planet x is a brown dwarf currently within our planetary system soon to pass relatively close to earth sitchin disagreed with the timing of passage
sitchin also postulated that pluto began life as gaga a satellite of saturn which due to gravitational disruption caused by nibirus passing was flung into orbit beyond neptune


 serpo 

project serpo is an alleged top-secret exchange program between the united states government and an alien planet called serpo in the zeta reticuli star system details of the alleged exchange program have appeared in several ufo conspiracy stories including one incident in 1983— in which a man identifying himself as usaf sergeant richard c doty contacted investigative journalist linda moulton howe claiming to be able to supply her air force records of the exchange for her hbo documentary the et factor only to pull out without providing any evidence to substantiate his story— and one incident in 2005 when a series of emails were sent to a ufo discussion group run by victor martinez claiming that the project was real some variations on the conspiracy story state that the name serpo is the nickname of the extrasolar planet other versions state that it is a mispronunciation of either serponia or seinu by us authorities involved in the project
the first mention of a project serpo was in a ufo email list maintained by enthusiast victor martinez various versions of the conspiracy theory circulated and were later detailed on a website according to the most common version of the story an alien survived a crash near roswell in the later 1940s see roswell ufo incident this alien was detained but treated well by american military forces contacted its home planet and eventually repatriated the story continues by claiming that this led to the establishment of some sort of relationship between the american government and the people of its home world – said to be a planet of the binary star system zeta reticuli
zeta reticuli has a history in ufology including the betty and barney hill abduction and the bob lazar story having been claimed as the home system of an alien race called the greys
the story finally claims that twelve american military personnel visited the planet between 1965 and 1978 and that all of the party have since died from after effects of high radiation levels from the two suns another version of the story says that eight 8 team members returned on the seven 7 month trek home team member 308 team pilot 2 died of a pulmonary embolism en route to serpo on the 9-month journey 11 arrived safely one 1 died on the planet – and both of their bodies were returned to earth – while two 2 others decided to remain on the alien homeworld of serpo httpwwwserpoorgrelease36php one criticism of project serpo stems from the lack of veracity of one of its alleged witnesses sergeant richard doty doty has been involved in other alleged ufo-related activities see majestic 12 and paul bennewitz and thus is a discredited source or a purposeful provider of disinformation additionally there is no physical evidence supporting the projects existence according to tim swartz of mysteries magazine doty who promised evidence to moulton howe before backing out has been involved in circulating several other ufo conspiracy stories swartz also expressed that the details of project serpo have varied considerably with different accounts it has been alleged that the entire series of posts were designed to be viral marketing for a new book by doty
further criticisms of the story include the usual arguments against conspiracy theories ufos and faster-than-light travel as well as astronomical knowledge of the zeta reticuli system there is currently no evidence of life in the system and also no evidence of planets because the stars are widely separated several thousand astronomical units claims of excess radiation as a result of the presence of a second star are nonsensical on a more fundamental level it is entirely possible that the messages originating the story were deliberate hoaxes the postings were to internet forums that cover conspiracy theories and ufos and a cursory examination of such forums shows that hoaxes are not uncommon some ufologists have even claimed that the messages were a hoax perpetrated by the american military and intelligence communities as a cover for real secret programs
bill ryan a chief proponent of publicizing the project serpo claims announced on march 5 2007 that he was stepping down from his role as webmaster for the serpo material ryan nevertheless maintains his belief that an extraterrestrial exchange program did occur – although he states that the serpo releases definitely contained disinformation
