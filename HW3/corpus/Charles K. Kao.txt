sir charles kuen kao gbm kbe frs freng born 4 november 1933 is a chinese-born shanghainese electrical engineer and physicist who pioneered the development and use of fiber optics in telecommunications in the 1960s kao created various methods to combine glass fibers with lasers in order to transmit digital data which laid the groundwork for the evolution of the internet communication as we know it including the internet would not exist without fiber optics said william wulf president of the national academy of engineering in 1999
known as the godfather of broadband the father of fiber optics and the father of fiber optic communications kao was awarded the 2009 nobel prize in physics for groundbreaking achievements concerning the transmission of light in fibers for optical communication kao holds citizenships in hong kong the united kingdom and the united states


 early life 
charles kao was born in shanghai in 1933 and his ancestral home is in nearby jinshan he studied chinese classics at home with his brother under a tutor he also studied english and french at an international school in shanghai which was founded by a number of progressive chinese educators including cai yuanpei
kaos family moved to hong kong in 1948 where he completed his secondary education advanced level at st josephs college in 1952 he did his undergraduate studies in electrical engineering at woolwich polytechnic now the university of greenwich obtaining his bsc degree
he then pursued research and received his phd degree in electrical engineering in 1965 from university college london under professor harold barlow as an external student while working at standard telecommunication laboratories stl in harlow england the research centre of standard telephones and cables it is there that kao did his first groundbreaking work as an engineer and researcher working alongside george hockham under the supervision of alec reeves
kao joined the chinese university of hong kong cuhk in 1970 to found the department of electronics which later became the department of electronic engineering during this period kao was the reader and then the chair professor of electronics at cuhk he built up both undergraduate and graduate study programs of electronics and saw the graduation of his first students under his leadership the school of education and other new research institutes were established he then went back to itt corporation in 1974 the parent corporation of stc at that time in the united states and worked in roanoke virginia first as chief scientist and later as director of engineering in 1982 he became the first itt executive scientist and was stationed mainly at the advanced technology center in connecticut while there he served as an adjunct professor and fellow of trumbull college at yale university in 1985 kao spent one year in west germany at the sel research centre in 1986 kao was the corporate director of research at itt
kao was the vice-chancellor president of the chinese university of hong kong from 1987 to 1996 after his retirement from cuhk in 1996 kao spent his 6-month sabbatical leave at the imperial college london department of electrical and electronic engineering from 1997 to 2002 he also served as visiting professor in the same department from 1993 to 1994 he was the president of asaihl the association of southeast asian institutions of higher learning

 work and related history 


 fiber optics and communications 

in the 1960s at standard telecommunication laboratories stl based in harlow essex kao and his co-workers did their pioneering work in the realisation of fiber optics as a telecommunications medium by demonstrating that the high-loss of existing fibre optics arose from impurities in the glass rather than from an underlying problem with the technology itself
in 1963 when charles first joined the optical communications research team he made notes summarising the background situation and available technology at the time and identifying the key individuals involved initially kao worked in the team of antoni e karbowiak toni karbowiak who was working under alec reeves to study optical waveguides for communications kaos task was to investigate fiber attenuation for which he collected samples from different fiber manufacturers and also investigated the properties of bulk glasses carefully kaos study primarily convinced himself that the impurities in material caused the high light losses of those fibers
in 1963 kao was appointed head of the electro-optics research group at stl he took over the optical communication program of stl in december 1964 because his supervisor karbowiak left to take the chair in communications in the school of electrical engineering at the university of new south wales unsw sydney australia
although kao succeeded karbowiak as manager of optical communications research he immediately decided to abandon karbowiaks plan thin-film waveguide and overall change research direction with his colleague george hockham they not only considered optical physics but also the material properties the results were first presented by kao to the iee in january 1966 in london and further published in july with george hockham 1964–1965 worked with kao this study first theorized and proposed to use glass fibers to implement optical communication the ideas especially structural features and materials described are largely the basis of todays optical fiber communications
in 1965 kao with hockham concluded that the fundamental limitation for glass light attenuation is below 20 dbkm decibels per kilometer is a measure of the attenuation of a signal over a distance which is a key threshold value for optical communications however at the time of this determination optical fibers commonly exhibited light loss as high as 1,000 dbkm and even more this conclusion opened the intense race to find low-loss materials and suitable fibers for reaching such criteria
kao together with his new team members including tw davies mw jones and cr wright pursued this goal by testing various materials they precisely measured the attenuation of light with different wavelengths in glasses and other materials during this period kao pointed out that the high purity of fused silica sio2 made it an ideal candidate for optical communication kao also stated that the impurity of glass material is the main cause for the dramatic decay of light transmission inside glass fiber rather than fundamental physical effects such as scattering as many physicists thought at that time and such impurity could be removed this led to a worldwide study and production of high-purity glass fibers when kao first proposed that such glass fiber could be used for long-distance information transfer and could replace copper wires which were used for telecommunication during that era his ideas were widely disbelieved later people realized that kaos ideas revolutionized the whole communication technology and industry
kao played a leading role in the early stage of engineering and commercial realization of optical communication in spring 1966 kao traveled to the us but failed to interest bell labs which was a competitor of stl in communication technology at that time he subsequently traveled to japan and gained support kao visited many glass and polymer factories discussed with various people including engineers scientists businessmen about the techniques and improvement of glass fiber manufacture
in 1969 kao with mw jones measured the intrinsic loss of bulk-fused silica at 4 dbkm which is the first evidence of ultra-transparent glass bell labs started considering fiber optics seriously
kao developed important techniques and configurations for glass fiber waveguides and contributed to the development of different fiber types and system devices which met both civil and military application requirements and peripheral supporting systems for optical fiber communication in mid-1970s he did seminal work on glass fiber fatigue strength when named the first itt executive scientist kao launched the terabit technology program in addressing the high frequency limits of signal processing so kao is also known as the father of the terabit technology concept kao has published more than 100 papers and was granted over 30 patents including the water-resistant high-strength fibers with ms maklad
at an early stage of developing optic fibers kao already strongly preferred single mode for long-distance optical communication instead of using multi-mode systems his vision later was followed and now is applied almost exclusively
kao is also a visionary of modern submarine communications cables and largely promoted this idea he predicted in 1983 that worlds seas would be littered with fiber optics five years ahead of the time that such a trans-oceanic fiber-optic cable first became serviceable
ali javans introduction of a steady helium–neon laser and kaos discovery of fiber light-loss properties now are recognized as the two essential milestones for the development of fiber-optic communications


 environmental studies and energy leadership 
kao is one of the few earliest who started studying the environmental effects of the land reclamation in hong kong and presented one of his first related studies at the conference of acu association of commonwealth universities in edinburgh in 1972
kao was the chairman and member of the energy advisory committee eac of hong kong for two years and retired from the position on july 15 2000 kao is a member of the council of advisors on innovation and technology of hong kong appointed on april 20 2000
