a wet moon also called a cheshire moon is the visual phenomenon when the horns of the crescent moon point up at an angle away from the horizon so that the crescent takes on the appearance of a bowl or smile a wet moon occurs when the crescent moon is low above the horizon and at a point more or less directly above the suns invisible position below the horizon this in turn is determined by the positions of the moon and earth in their respective orbits the inclinations of these orbits relative to one another and to earths celestial equator and the observers latitude on earth wet moons occur routinely in the tropics where the sun and moon rise and set nearly vertically but rarely in the polar regions where the sun and moon rise and set at a glancing angle or not at all


 name 
the terms wet moon and dry moon originate from hawaiian mythology where it was thought that the moon appeared as a bowl that would fill up with rainwater the period when this is most common january 20 to february 18 corresponds with kaelo the water bearer in hawaiian astrology and makes the moon known as the dripping wet moon as summer comes the crescent shape shifts pouring out the water and causing the summer rains after the bowl empties it dries out and rights itself creating the dry moon however others say that this is a wet moon because it permitted the water to pour out
the term cheshire moon is a reference to the smile of the cheshire cat from lewis carrolls novel alices adventures in wonderland


 explanation 

the annual path that the sun appears to follow against the background of relatively fixed stars is known as the ecliptic since the moons orbit is inclined 5.14° to the ecliptic the moon will always remain within about 5° north or south of the ecliptic for half of a sidereal month with respect to the stars the moon is either north or south of the ecliptic the two points where the moons orbit intersects that of earth are called the lunar nodes at the ascending node the moon moves north of the ecliptic while at the descending node the satellite moves south eclipses occur at these points hence the name ecliptic the nodes precess around the ecliptic axis at the rate of one circuit every 18.6 years the ecliptic makes the steepest angle to the horizon at the equinoxes since the crescent moon appears near the sun the crescent would appear to lie on its back when low above the horizon around the equinoxes
