a solar telescope is a special purpose telescope used to observe the sun solar telescopes usually detect light with wavelengths in or not far outside the visible spectrum obsolete names for sun telescopes include heliograph and photoheliograph


 professional solar telescopes 
solar telescopes need optics large enough to achieve the best possible diffraction limit but less so for the associated light-collecting power of other astronomical telescopes however recently newer narrower filters and higher framerates have also driven solar telescopes towards photon-starved operations both the european solar telescope est as well as the advanced technology solar telescope atst have larger apertures not only to increase the resolution but also to increase the light-collecting power
because solar telescopes operate during the day seeing is generally worse than for night-time telescopes because the ground around the telescope is heated which causes turbulence and degrades the resolution to alleviate this solar telescopes are usually built on towers and the structures are painted white the dutch open telescope is built on an open framework to allow the wind to pass through the complete structure and provide cooling around the telescopes main mirror
another solar telescope-specific problem is the heat generated by the tightly-focused sunlight for this reason a heat stop is an integral part of the design of solar telescopes for the upcoming atst the heat load is 2.5 mwm2 with peak powers of 11.4 kw the goal of such a heat stop is not only to survive this heat load but also to remain cool enough not to induce any additional turbulence inside the telescopes dome
professional solar observatories may have main optical elements with very long focal lengths although not always dutch open telescope and light paths operating in a vacuum or helium to eliminate air motion due to convection inside the telescope however this is not possible for apertures over 1 meter at which the pressure difference at the entrance window of the vacuum tube becomes too large therefore the est and atst have active cooling of the dome to minimize the temperature difference between the air inside and outside the telescope
because the sun travels on a narrow fixed path across the sky some solar telescopes are fixed in position and are sometimes buried underground with the only moving part being a heliostat to track the sun one example of this is the mcmath-pierce solar telescope

 amateur solar telescopes 

in the field of amateur astronomy there are many methods used to observe the sun amateurs use everything from simple systems to project the sun on a piece of white paper light blocking filters herschel wedges which redirect 95% of the light away from the eyepiece up to hydrogen-alpha filter systems and even home built spectrohelioscopes in contrast to professional telescopes amateur solar telescopes are usually much smaller
