in astronomy and observational cosmology the boomerang experiment balloon observations of millimetric extragalactic radiation and geophysics was an experiment which measured the cosmic microwave background radiation of a part of the sky during three sub-orbital high-altitude balloon flights it was the first experiment to make large high-fidelity images of the cmb temperature anisotropies and is best known for the discovery in 2000 that the geometry of the universe is close to flat with similar results from the competing maxima experiment
by using a telescope which flew at over 42,000 meters high it was possible to reduce the atmospheric absorption of microwaves to a minimum this allowed massive cost reduction compared to a satellite probe though only a tiny part of the sky could be scanned
the first was a test flight over north america in 1997 in the two subsequent flights in 1998 and 2003 the balloon was launched from mcmurdo station in the antarctic it was carried by the polar vortex winds in a circle around the south pole returning after two weeks from this phenomenon the telescope took its name
the boomerang team was led by andrew e lange of caltech and paolo de bernardis of the university of rome la sapienza


 instrumentation 
the experiment uses bolometers for radiation detection these bolometers are kept at a temperature of 0.27 kelvin at this temperature the material has a very low heat capacity according to the debye law thus incoming microwave light will cause a large temperature change proportional to the intensity of the incoming waves which is measured with sensitive thermometers
an off-axis 1.3-meter primary mirror focuses the microwaves onto the focal plane which consist of 16 horns these horns operating at 145 ghz 245 ghz and 345 ghz are arranged into 8 pixels only a tiny fraction of the sky can be seen concurrently so the telescope must rotate to scan the whole field of view


 results 

together with experiments like the saskatoon experiment toco maxima and others the boomerang data from 1997 and 1998 determined the angular diameter distance to the surface of last scattering with high precision when combined with complementary data regarding the value of hubbles constant the boomerang data determined the geometry of the universe to be flat supporting the supernova evidence for the existence of dark energy the 2003 flight of boomerang resulted in extremely high signal-to-noise ratio maps of the cmb temperature anisotropy and a measurement of the polarization of the cmb
