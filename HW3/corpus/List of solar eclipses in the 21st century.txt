during the 21st century there will be 224 solar eclipses of which 77 will be partial 72 will be annular 68 will be total and 7 will be hybrids between total and annular eclipses of these two annular and one total eclipse will be non-central in the sense that the very center axis of the moons shadow will miss the earth for more information see gamma in the 21st century the greatest number of eclipses in one year is four in 2011 2029 2047 2065 2076 and 2094 the predictions given here are by fred espenak of nasas goddard space flight center
at this point the longest duration in which the moon completely covered the sun known as totality was during the solar eclipse of july 22 2009 this total solar eclipse had a maximum duration of 6 minutes and 39 seconds the longest possible duration of a total solar eclipse is 7 minutes and 32 seconds the longest annular solar eclipse of the 21st century took place on january 15 2010 with a duration of 11 minutes and 8 seconds the maximum possible duration is 12 minutes and 29 seconds the eclipse of may 20 2050 will be the second hybrid eclipse in the span of less than one year the first one being on november 25 2049
the next solar eclipse partial will occur on july 13 2018 the last solar eclipse partial occurred on february 15 2018
the table contains the date and time of the greatest eclipse in dynamical time which in this case is the time when the axis of the moons shadow cone passes closest to the centre of earth this is in universal time the number of the saros series that the eclipse belongs to is given followed by the magnitude of the eclipse the fraction of the suns diameter obscured by the moon and the type of the eclipse either total annular partial or hybrid for total and annular eclipses the duration of the eclipse is given as well as the location of the greatest eclipse the point of maximum eclipse and the path width of the total or annular eclipse the geographical areas from which the eclipse can be seen are listed
