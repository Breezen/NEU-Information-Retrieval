gemini 12 officially gemini xii was a 1966 manned spaceflight in nasas project gemini it was the 10th and final manned gemini flight the 18th manned american spaceflight and the 26th spaceflight of all time including x-15 flights over 100 kilometers 54 nmi commanded by gemini vii veteran james a lovell the flight featured three periods of extravehicular activity eva by rookie edwin buzz aldrin lasting a total of 5 hours and 30 minutes it also achieved the fifth rendezvous and fourth docking with an agena target vehicle
gemini xii marked a successful conclusion of the gemini program achieving the last of its goals by successfully demonstrating that astronauts can effectively work outside of spacecraft this was instrumental in paving the way for the apollo program to achieve its goal of landing a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s

 launch 
liftoff of the atlasagena target vehicle occurred at 20759 pm est and of the geminititan spacecraft at 34633 pm est on november 11 all launch vehicle systems performed nominally during powered flight but at staging there was a recurrence of the first stage oxidizer tank rupture first seen on gemini 10s launch on gemini 12 the fuel tank appeared to have also ruptured as a white cloud was seen emitting from the spent stage along with the orange nitrogen tetroxide another episode of green man also occurred at seco referring to pitch gyrations caused by pressure buildup in the second stage protective skirt


 objectives 

at the completion of the previous gemini flight the program still had not demonstrated that an astronaut could work easily and efficiently outside the spacecraft in preparation for gemini xii new improved restraints were added to the outside of the capsule and a new technique—underwater training—was introduced which would become a staple of future space-walk simulation aldrins two-hour 20-minute tethered space-walk during which he photographed star fields retrieved a micrometeorite collector and did other chores at last demonstrated the feasibility of extravehicular activity two more stand-up evas also went smoothly as did the by-now routine rendezvous and docking with an agena which was done manually using the onboard computer and charts when a rendezvous radar failed the climb to a higher orbit however was canceled because of a problem with the agena booster
during orbital injection the gatv engine experienced a drop in turbopump speed lasting about 2.5 seconds after this pump performance returned to normal telemetry data indicated erratic pump speeds but engine performance did not reflect this ground controllers decided not to risk the planned orbital boost maneuver since the exact reason for the pump slowdown was unclear following gemini 12s reentry and during the gatvs 63rd orbit they attempted to fire the propulsion system but a stuck fuel valve prevented engine start from occurring
it was suspected that a turbopump bearing failure caused the anomalous conditions during orbital injection followed by heating and melting of pump components the inability of ground controllers to start the engine during the 63rd orbit was possibly due to melted or loose debris blocking the fuel valve and preventing its operation the telemetry data falsely reporting erratic pump speed was concluded to be debris being knocked around and affecting the data probes
many documentaries afterward largely credit the spacewalk innovations including the underwater training to aldrin himself
gemini 12 was designed to perform rendezvous and docking with the agena target vehicle to conduct three extra-vehicular activity eva operations to conduct a tethered stationkeeping exercise to perform docked maneuvers using the agena propulsion system to change orbit and demonstrate an automatic reentry
when gemini 12 was being planned one of the possibilities raised was the potential for the flight to be run in conjunction with the first apollo mission which had been tentatively scheduled for the last quarter of 1966 by may 1966 delays in making apollo ready for flight just by itself and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the gemini made that impractical this became moot when slippage in readiness of the apollo spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed and the apollo mission was rescheduled for february 21 1967


 experiments 

the 14 scientific experiments were 1 frog egg growth under zero-g 2 synoptic terrain photography 3 synoptic weather photography 4 nuclear emulsions 5 airglow horizon photography 6 uv astronomical photography and 7 dim sky photography two micrometeorite collection experiments as well as three space phenomena photography experiments were not fully completed


 reentry 
the capsule was controlled on reentry by computer and splashed down 4.8 kilometers from its target the crew were taken aboard the aircraft carrier uss wasp
the gemini 12 mission was supported by the following us department of defense resources 9,775 personnel 65 aircraft and 12 ships
postflight medical examination disclosed no unusual conditions in either astronaut both were slightly exhausted and dehydrated due to problems with the spacecrafts water supply system forcing them to reduce their fluid intake on the last day of the mission and lovell had a mild case of pinkeye


 insignia 

the patchs unique orange and black colors are a link to the flights original scheduled date close to halloween the roman numeral xii is located at the 12 oclock position on the face of a clock with the gemini spacecraft pointing to it like the hour hand of a clock this represents the position of gemini 12 as the last flight of the gemini program with the apollo project following this last flight of the gemini program the ultimate objective—the moon—is symbolized by the crescent on the left


 spacecraft location 
after several years at the museum of transport and technology in auckland new zealand the spacecraft was returned to the united states it is now on display at the adler planetarium chicago illinois lovell and aldrin were reunited with the spacecraft november 9 2006 during the opening for adlers shoot for the moon exhibit almost 40 years after the mission launched
