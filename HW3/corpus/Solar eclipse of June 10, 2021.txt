an annular solar eclipse will occur on june 10 2021 a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between earth and the sun thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the sun for a viewer on earth an annular solar eclipse occurs when the moons apparent diameter is smaller than the suns blocking most of the suns light and causing the sun to look like an annulus ring an annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the earth thousands of kilometres wide this eclipse will be unusual as the path of the annular eclipse will move to the north east then north north west west south west south and finally south east across the arctic while most eclipse paths move west to east this reversal is only possible in polar regions this eclipse is also notable for the fact that the path of annularity passes over the north pole
while the eclipse is visible primarily in the relatively unpopulated area near the arctic circle in the northeastern united states and canada the sun will be partially eclipsed at sunrise
