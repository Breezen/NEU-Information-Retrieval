a total penumbral eclipse is a lunar eclipse that occurs when the moon becomes completely immersed in the penumbral cone of the earth without touching the umbra
it is a narrow path for the moon to pass within the penumbra and outside the umbra it can happen on the earths northern or southern penumbral edges in addition the size of the penumbra is sometimes too small where the moon enters it to contain the moon the width of the earths penumbra is determined by the suns angular diameter at the time of the eclipse and the moons angular diameter is larger than the sun over part of its elliptical orbit depending on whether the eclipse occurs at its nearest perigee or farthest point apogee in its orbit around the earth the majority of the time the size of the moon and the size of the earths penumbra where the moon crosses it mean that most eclipses will not be total penumbral in nature


 frequency 
such eclipses constitute a relatively small fraction of lunar eclipses and the distribution of these events is uneven occurring between 0 and 9 times per century the period of this variation is about 600 years and also correlates with the frequency of total umbral eclipses and tetrads the maximum number in freds 5k canon httpseclipsegsfcnasagovlecat5lecataloghtml is 8 for saros 19 see httpseclipsegsfcnasagovlesaroslesaros019html saros 32 and 132 have 7 saros 58 95 and 114 have 6 114 is the only saros in the canon to have a total of 7 total penumbral lunar eclipses that are not all in a row and see also this table from httpwwwmarco-peuschelde
