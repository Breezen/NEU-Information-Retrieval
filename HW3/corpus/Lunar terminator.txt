a terminator or twilight zone is a moving line that divides the daylit side and the dark night side of a planetary body a terminator is defined as the locus of points on a planet or moon where the line through its parent star is tangent an observer on the terminator of such an orbiting body with an atmosphere would experience twilight due to light scattering by particles in the gaseous layer


 earths terminator 

on earth the terminator is a circle with a diameter that is approximately that of earth the terminator passes through any point on earths surface twice a day at sunrise and at sunset apart from polar regions where this only occurs when the point is not experiencing midnight sun or polar night the circle separates the portion of earth experiencing daylight from that experiencing darkness night while a little over one half of earth is illuminated at any point in time with exceptions during eclipses the terminator path varies by time of day due to earths rotation on its axis the terminator path also varies by time of year due to earths orbital revolution around the sun thus the plane of the terminator is nearly parallel to planes created by lines of longitude during the equinoxes and its maximum angle is approximately 23.5° to the pole during the solstices


 surface transit speed 
at the equator under flat conditions without obstructions like mountains or at a height above any such obstructions the terminator moves at approximately 1,668 kilometers per hour 1,036 miles per hour this speed can appear to increase when near obstructions such as the height of a mountain as the shadow of the obstruction will be cast over the ground in advance of the terminator along a flat landscape the speed of the terminator decreases as it approaches the poles where it can reach a speed of zero full-day sunlight or darkness
supersonic aircraft like jet fighters or concorde and tupolev tu-144 supersonic transports are the only aircraft able to overtake the maximum speed of the terminator at the equator however slower vehicles can overtake the terminator at higher latitudes and it is possible to walk faster than the terminator at the poles near to the equinoxes the visual effect is that of seeing the sun rise in the west or set in the east


 grey-line radio propagation 
strength of radio propagation changes between day- and night-side of the ionosphere this is primarily because the d layer which absorbs high frequency signals disappears rapidly on the dark side of the terminator whereas the e and f layers above the d layer take longer to form this time-difference puts the ionosphere into a unique intermediate state along the terminator called the “grey line”
amateur radio operators take advantage of conditions along the terminator to perform long distance communications called gray-line or grey-line propagation this signal path is a type of skywave propagation under good conditions radio waves can travel along the terminator to antipodal points

 lunar terminator 

the lunar terminator is the division between the illuminated and dark hemispheres of the moon it is the lunar equivalent of the division between night and day on the earth spheroid although the moons much lower rate of rotation means it takes longer for it to pass across the surface
due to the angle at which sunlight strikes this portion of the moon shadows cast by craters and other geological features are elongated thereby making such features more apparent to the observer this phenomenon is similar to the lengthening of shadows on earth when the sun is low in the sky for this reason much lunar photographic study centers on the illuminated area near the lunar terminator and the resulting shadows provide accurate descriptions of the terrain


 lunar terminator illusion 
the lunar terminator or tilt illusion is an optical illusion arising from the erroneous expectation of an observer on earth that the direction of sunlight illuminating the moon ie a line perpendicular to the terminator should correspond with the position of the sun but does not appear to do so the cause of the illusion is simply the observer is not taking into account that the observed slope of a light ray will change across the sky because of the lack of visual clues to establish 3d perspective


 scientific significance 
examination of a terminator can yield information about the surface of a planetary body for example the presence of an atmosphere can create a fuzzier terminator as the particles within an atmosphere are at a higher elevation the light source can remain visible even after it has set at ground level these particles scatter the light reflecting some of it to the ground hence the sky can remain illuminated even after the sun has set
low earth orbit satellites take advantage of the fact that certain polar orbits set near the terminator do not suffer from eclipse therefore their solar cells are continuously lit by sunlight such orbits are called dawn-dusk orbits a type of sun-synchronous orbit this prolongs the operational life of a leo satellite as onboard battery life is prolonged it also enables specific experiments that require minimum interference from the sun as the designers can opt to install the relevant sensors on the dark side of the satellite
