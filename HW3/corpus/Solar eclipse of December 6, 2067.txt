a total solar eclipse will occur on december 6 2067 it is a hybrid event beginning and ending as an annular eclipse a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between earth and the sun thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the sun for a viewer on earth an annular solar eclipse occurs when the moons apparent diameter is smaller than the suns blocking most of the suns light and causing the sun to look like an annulus ring an annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the earth thousands of kilometres wide

 tritos series 
this eclipse is a part of a tritos cycle repeating at alternating nodes every 135 synodic months ≈ 3986.63 days or 11 years minus 1 month their appearance and longitude are irregular due to a lack of synchronization with the anomalistic month period of perigee but groupings of 3 tritos cycles ≈ 33 years minus 3 months come close ≈ 434.044 anomalistic months so eclipses are similar in these groupings
