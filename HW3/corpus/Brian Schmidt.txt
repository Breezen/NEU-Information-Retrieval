 early life and education 

schmidt an only child was born on 24 february 1967 in missoula montana where his father dana c schmidt was a fisheries biologist when he was 13 his family relocated to anchorage alaska
schmidt attended bartlett high school in anchorage alaska and graduated in 1985 he has said that he wanted to be a meteorologist since i was about five-years-old but  i did some work at the usa national weather service up in anchorage and didnt enjoy it very much it was less scientific not as exciting as i thought it would be—there was a lot of routine but i guess i was just a little naive about what being a meteorologist meant his decision to study astronomy which he had seen as a minor pastime was made just before he enrolled at university even then he was not fully committed he said ill do astronomy and change into something else later and just never made that change
he graduated with a bs physics and bs astronomy from the university of arizona in 1989 he received his ma astronomy in 1992 and then phd astronomy in 1993 from harvard university schmidts phd thesis was supervised by robert kirshner and used type ii supernovae to measure the hubble constant
while at harvard he met his future wife the australian jenny jennifer m gordon who was a phd student in economics in 1994 they moved to australia


 research and career 
schmidt was a postdoctoral research fellow at the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics 1993–1994 before moving on to the anus mount stromlo observatory in 1995
in 1994 schmidt and nicholas b suntzeff formed the high-z supernova search team to measure the expected deceleration of the universe and the deceleration parameter q0 using distances to type ia supernovae in 1995 the hzt at a meeting at the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics elected schmidt as the overall leader of the hzt schmidt led the team from australia and in 1998 in the hzt paper with first author adam riess the first evidence was presented that the universes expansion rate is not decelerating it is accelerating the teams observations were contrary to the then-current models which predicted that the expansion of the universe should be slowing down and when the preliminary results emerged schmidt assumed it was an error and he spent the next six weeks trying to find the mistake but there was no mistake contrary to expectations by monitoring the brightness and measuring the redshift of the supernovae they discovered that these billion-year old exploding stars and their galaxies were accelerating away from our reference frame this result was also found nearly simultaneously by the supernova cosmology project led by saul perlmutter the corroborating evidence between the two competing studies led to the acceptance of the accelerating universe theory and initiated new research to understand the nature of the universe such as the existence of dark energy the discovery of the accelerating universe was named breakthrough of the year by science in 1998 and schmidt was jointly awarded the 2011 nobel prize in physics along with riess and perlmutter for their groundbreaking work
schmidt is currently leading the skymapper telescope project and the associated southern sky survey which will encompass billions of individual objects enabling the team to pick out the most unusual objects in 2014 they announced the discovery of the first star which did not contain any iron indicating that it is a very primitive star probably formed during the first rush of star formation following the big bang
he is the chairman of the board of directors of astronomy australia limited and he serves on the management committee of the arc centre of excellence for all-sky astrophysics caastro in july 2012 schmidt was given a three-year appointment to sit on the questacon advisory council as of march 2017 schmidt serves as a member of the bulletin of the atomic scientists board of sponsors


 anu vice-chancellor 
on 24 june 2015 it was announced he would replace ian young as the 12th vice-chancellor of the australian national university to commence his tenure on 1 january 2016 the chancellor of the anu professor gareth evans said brian schmidt is superbly placed to deliver on the ambition of anu founders – to permanently secure our position among the great universities of the world and as a crucial contributor to the nation  we had a stellar field of international and australian candidates and have chosen an inspirational leader  brians vision vitality global stature and communication skills are going to take our national university to places it has never been before


 science advocacy 
the publicity that came with winning the nobel prize has given schmidt the opportunity to help the public understand why science is important to society and to champion associated causes
public education
one of his first acts after winning the nobel prize was to donate 100,000 out of his prize money to the primaryconnections program an initiative of the australian academy of science that assists primary school teachers he has continued to press for improvements to the public school system particularly in the sciences and mathematical literacy numeracy he sees the major problem is that so few of the teachers are trained in stem science technology engineering and mathematics disciplines he used the opportunity of delivering a speech at the national press club to call for more focus on the public education system including holding principals more accountable and the proper use of standardised testing concluding with the warning that otherwise the fundamental tenet of australian democracy that we all deserve a fair go is at risk of being eroded away along with our public school system at the other end of the spectrum he also raises the profile of the matter by visiting primary schools personally to answer childrens questions
funding for scientific and medical research
schmidt is a strong supporter of funding scientific and medical research on a long-term non-partisan basis driven by a national research strategy he has often voiced his concern that the current year-to-year uncertainty and lack of co-ordination make it difficult to establish and staff large facilities or to participate in multi-national ventures and that scientists spend too much time applying for funding instead of doing research interviewed by the australian financial review schmidt was characteristically forthright its unclear to me whether or not we will continue to be a great astronomy nation if were damaged it will take 20 years to fix ourselves it only takes one year to cause 20 years of damage
climate change
he urges people to pay attention to the consensus of expert opinions instead of basing their conclusions on the incomplete information which they personally know launching the australian academy of sciences report the science of climate change questions and answers schmidt commented that whenever this subject comes up it never ceases to amaze me how each person i meet suddenly becomes an expert more surprising is the supreme confidence that non-experts scientists and non-scientists alike have in their own understanding of the subject he even put up 10,000 of his own money in a bet with maurice newman who is the chairman of the prime ministers business council that global temperatures will rise in 2015 he presented the mainau declaration 2015 on climate change on the final day of the 65th lindau nobel laureate meeting which was signed by 76 nobel laureates and handed to then president of the french republic françois hollande as part of the successful cop21 climate summit in paris


 awards and honours 

schmidt has received the australian governments inaugural malcolm mcintosh prize for achievement in the physical sciences in 2000 harvard universitys bok prize in 2000 the australian academy of sciences pawsey medal medal in 2001 and the astronomical society of indias vainu bappu medal in 2002 he was the marc aaronson memorial lecturer in 2005 the same year he received an arc federation fellowship and in 2006 he shared the shaw prize in astronomy with adam riess and saul perlmutter
schmidt and the other members of the high-z team the set defined by the co-authors of riess et al 1998 shared the 2007 gruber cosmology prize a 500,000 award with saul perlmutter of the lawrence berkeley national laboratory and the supernova cosmology project the set defined by the co-authors of perlmutter et al 1999 for their discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe
schmidt along with riess and perlmutter jointly won the 2011 nobel prize in physics for their observations which led to the discovery of the accelerating universe
schmidt was appointed a companion of the order of australia in the 2013 australia day honours he was called australian of the year for 2011 by the australian newspaper he is a fellow and council member of the australian academy of science the united states national academy of sciences the royal society and foreign member of the spanish royal academy of sciences
schmidt adam riess and the high-z supernova search team shared in the 2015 breakthrough prize in fundamental physics
schmidt was awarded the pawsey medal in 2001 the shaw prize in 2006 the dirac medal in 2012 and the niels bohr institute medal of honour in 2015 he was elected a fellow of the royal society frs in 2012 his certificate of election to the royal society reads


 personal life 
schmidt is married to jennifer gordon they met while they were both studying for their phds at harvard – he in astrophysics and she in economics they decided to settle in australia which he had already visited on several occasions to visit family he now holds dual citizenship of australia and the united states
he is not religious being described as a militant agnostic with his tagline i dont know and neither do you


 vineyard and winery 
schmidt and his wife own and operate maipenrai vineyard and winery a small winery established in 2000 in sutton near canberra which was rated a four-star winery by the james halliday australian wine companion the vineyard covers 1.1 hectares 2.7 acres producing exclusively pinot noir grapes and the wines have received favourable reviews for example chris shanahan described the 2010 vintage as a successful wine and a pleasure to drinkmaipenrai offering bright deep fruit flavours  with a juicy texture a touch of oak pushing through and a teasing biting savoury element adding to the excitement to add to the wines inherent qualities schmidt also quips that its easier to sell your wine when you have a nobel prize at the 2011 nobel prize ceremonies in stockholm he presented the king carl xvi gustaf of sweden with a bottle of wine from his winery
in 2013 schmidt was appointed to join the board of the federal governments australian wine research institute the institutes chairman peter dawson commented that schmidt brings to the board a unique combination of scientific excellence wine industry knowledge and relevant board experience
