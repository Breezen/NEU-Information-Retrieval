 tritos series 
this eclipse is a part of a tritos cycle repeating at alternating nodes every 135 synodic months ≈ 3986.63 days or 11 years minus 1 month their appearance and longitude are irregular due to a lack of synchronization with the anomalistic month period of perigee but groupings of 3 tritos cycles ≈ 33 years minus 3 months come close ≈ 434.044 anomalistic months so eclipses are similar in these groupings
