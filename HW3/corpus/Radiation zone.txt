a radiation zone radiative zone or radiative region is a layer of a stars interior where energy is primarily transported toward the exterior by means of radiative diffusion and thermal conduction rather than by convection energy travels through the radiation zone in the form of electromagnetic radiation as photons
matter in a radiation zone is so dense that photons can travel only a short distance before they are absorbed or scattered by another particle gradually shifting to longer wavelength as they do so for this reason it takes an average of 171,000 years for gamma rays from the core of the sun to leave the radiation zone over this range the temperature of the plasma drops from 15 million k near the core down to 1.5 million k at the base of the convection zone
in a radiative zone the temperature gradient—the change in temperature t as a function of radius r—is given by

where κr is the opacity ρr is the matter density lr is the luminosity and σ is the stefan–boltzmann constant hence the opacity κ and radiation flux l within a given layer of a star are important factors in determining how effective radiative diffusion is at transporting energy a high opacity or high luminosity can cause a high temperature gradient which results from a slow flow of energy those layers where convection is more effective than radiative diffusion at transporting energy thereby creating a lower temperature gradient will become convection zones


 main sequence stars 
for main sequence stars—those stars that are generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at the core the presence and location of radiative regions depends on the stars mass main sequence stars below about 0.3 solar masses are entirely convective meaning they do not have a radiative zone from 0.3 to 1.2 solar masses the region around the stellar core is a radiation zone separated from the overlying convection zone by the tachocline the radius of the radiative zone increases monotonically with mass with stars around 1.2 solar masses being almost entirely radiative above 1.2 solar masses the core region becomes a convection zone and the overlying region is a radiation zone with the amount of mass within the convective zone increasing with the mass of the star


 the sun 
in the sun the region between the solar core at 0.2 of the suns radius and the outer convection zone at 0.71 of the suns radius is referred to as the radiation zone although the core is also a radiative region the convection zone and the radiation zone are divided by the tachocline another part of the sun
