lunar theory attempts to account for the motions of the moon there are many irregularities or perturbations in the moons motion and many attempts have been made to account for them after centuries of being problematic lunar motion is now modeled to a very high degree of accuracy see section modern developments
lunar theory includes
the background of general theory including mathematical techniques used to analyze the moons motion and to generate formulae and algorithms for predicting its movements and also
quantitative formulae algorithms and geometrical diagrams that may be used to compute the moons position for a given time often by the help of tables based on the algorithms
lunar theory has a history of over 2000 years of investigation its more modern developments have been used over the last three centuries for fundamental scientific and technological purposes and are still being used in that way


 applications of lunar theory 
applications of lunar theory have included the following-
in the eighteenth century comparison between lunar theory and observation was used to test newtons law of universal gravitation by the motion of the lunar apogee
in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries navigational tables based on lunar theory initially in the nautical almanac were much used for the determination of longitude at sea by the method of lunar distances
in the very early twentieth century comparison between lunar theory and observation was used in another test of gravitational theory to test and rule out simon newcombs suggestion that a well-known discrepancy in the motion of the perihelion of mercury might be explained by a fractional adjustment of the power -2 in newtons inverse square law of gravitation the discrepancy was later successfully explained by the general theory of relativity
in the mid-twentieth century before the development of atomic clocks lunar theory and observation were used in combination to implement an astronomical time scale ephemeris time free of the irregularities of mean solar time
in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries modern developments of lunar theory are being used in the jet propulsion laboratory development ephemeris series of models of the solar system in conjunction with high-precision observations to test the exactness of physical relationships associated with the general theory of relativity including the strong equivalence principle relativistic gravitation geodetic precession and the constancy of the gravitational constant


 history 
the moon has been observed for millennia over these ages various levels of care and precision have been possible according to the techniques of observation available at any time there is a correspondingly long history of lunar theories it stretches from the times of the babylonian and greek astronomers down to modern lunar laser ranging

the history can be considered to fall into three parts from ancient times to newton the period of classical newtonian physics and modern developments


 ancient times to newton 


 babylon 
of babylonian astronomy practically nothing was known to historians of science before the 1880s surviving ancient writings of pliny had made bare mention of three astronomical schools in mesopotamia – at babylon uruk and hipparenum possibly sippar but definite modern knowledge of any details only began when joseph epping deciphered cuneiform texts on clay tablets from a babylonian archive in these texts he identified an ephemeris of positions of the moon since then knowledge of the subject still fragmentary has had to be built up by painstaking analysis of deciphered texts mainly in numerical form on tablets from babylon and uruk no trace has yet been found of anything from the third school mentioned by pliny
to the babylonian astronomer kidinnu in greek or latin kidenas or cidenas has been attributed the invention 5th or 4th century bc of what is now called “system  b” for predicting the position of the moon taking account that the moon continually changes its speed along its path relative to the background of fixed stars this system involved calculating daily stepwise changes of lunar speed up or down with a minimum and a maximum approximately each month the basis of these systems appears to have been arithmetical rather than geometrical but they did approximately account for the main lunar inequality now known as the equation of the center
the babylonians kept very accurate records for hundreds of years of new moons and eclipses some time between the years 500 bc and 400 bc they identified and began to use the 19 year cyclic relation between lunar months and solar years now known as the metonic cycle
this helped them built up a numerical theory of the main irregularities in the moons motion reaching remarkably good estimates for the different periods of the three most prominent features of the moons motion
the synodic month ie the mean period for the phases of the moon now called “system b” it reckons the synodic month as 29 days and sexagesimally 3,110,50 “time degrees” each time degree is one degree of the apparent motion of the stars or 4 minutes of time and the sexagesimal values after the semicolon are fractions of a time degree this converts to 29.530594 days  29ᵈ 12ʰ 44ᵐ 3.33ˢ to compare with a modern value as at 1900 jan 0 of 29.530589 days or 29ᵈ 12ʰ 44ᵐ 2.9ˢ this same value was used by hipparchos and ptolemy was used throughout the middle ages and still forms the basis of the hebrew calendar
the mean lunar velocity relative to the stars they estimated at 13° 10′ 35″ per day giving a corresponding month of 27.321598 days to compare with modern values of 13° 10′ 35.0275″ and 27.321582 days
the anomalistic month ie the mean period for the moons approximately monthly accelerations and decelerations in its rate of movement against the stars had a babylonian estimate of 27.5545833 days to compare with a modern value 27.554551 days
the draconitic month ie the mean period with which the path of the moon against the stars deviates first north and then south in ecliptic latitude by comparison with the ecliptic path of the sun was indicated by a number of different parameters leading to various estimates eg of 27.212204 days to compare with a modern value of 27.212221 but the babylonians also had a numerical relationship that 5458 synodic months were equal to 5923 draconitic months which when compared with their accurate value for the synodic month leads to practically exactly the modern figure for the draconitic month
the babylonian estimate for the synodic month was adopted for the greater part of two millennia by hipparchus ptolemy and medieval writers and it is still in use as part of the basis for the calculated hebrew jewish calendar


 greece and hellenistic egypt 
thereafter from hipparchus and ptolemy in the bithynian and ptolemaic epochs down to the time of newtons work in the seventeenth century lunar theories were composed mainly with the help of geometrical ideas inspired more or less directly by long series of positional observations of the moon prominent in these geometrical lunar theories were combinations of circular motions – applications of the theory of epicycles


 hipparchus 

hipparchus whose works are mostly lost and known mainly from quotations by other authors assumed that the moon moved in a circle inclined at 5° to the ecliptic rotating in a retrograde direction ie opposite to the direction of annual and monthly apparent movements of the sun and moon relative to the fixed stars once in 18​2⁄3 years the circle acted as a deferent carrying an epicycle along which the moon was assumed to move in a retrograde direction the center of the epicycle moved at a rate corresponding to the mean change in moons longitude while the period of the moon around the epicycle was an anomalistic month this epicycle approximately provided for what was later recognized as the elliptical inequality the equation of the center and its size approximated to an equation of the center of about 5° 1 this figure is much smaller than the modern value but it is close to the difference between the modern coefficients of the equation of the center 1st term and that of the evection the difference is accounted for by the fact that the ancient measurements were taken at times of eclipses and the effect of the evection which subtracts under those conditions from the equation of the center was at that time unknown and overlooked for further information see also separate article evection


 ptolemy 
ptolemys work the almagest had wide and long-lasting acceptance and influence for over a millennium he gave a geometrical lunar theory that improved on that of hipparchus by providing for a second inequality of the moons motion using a device that made the apparent apogee oscillate a little – prosneusis of the epicycle this second inequality or second anomaly accounted rather approximately not only for the equation of the center but also for what became known much later as the evection but this theory applied to its logical conclusion would make the distance and apparent diameter of the moon appear to vary by a factor of about 2 which is clearly not seen in reality the apparent angular diameter of the moon does vary monthly but only over a much narrower range of about 0.49°–0.55° this defect of the ptolemaic theory led to proposed replacements by ibn al-shatir in the 14th century and by copernicus in the 16th century


 ibn al-shatir and copernicus 
significant advances in lunar theory made by the arab astronomer ibn al-shatir 1304–1375 drawing on the observation that the distance to the moon did not change as drastically as required by ptolemys lunar model he produced a new lunar model that replaced ptolemys crank mechanism with a double epicycle model that reduced the computed range of distances of the moon from the earth a similar lunar theory developed some 150 years later by the renaissance astronomer nicolaus copernicus had the same advantage concerning the lunar distances


 tycho brahe johannes kepler and jeremiah horrocks 
tycho brahe and johannes kepler refined the ptolemaic lunar theory but did not overcome its central defect of giving a poor account of the mainly monthly variations in the moons distance apparent diameter and parallax their work added to the lunar theory three substantial further discoveries
the nodes and the inclination of the lunar orbital plane both appear to librate with a monthly according to tycho or semi-annual period according to kepler
the lunar longitude has a twice-monthly variation by which the moon moves faster than expected at new and full moon and slower than expected at the quarters
there is also an annual effect by which the lunar motion slows down a little in january and speeds up a little in july the annual equation
the refinements of brahe and kepler were recognized by their immediate successors as improvements but their seventeenth-century successors tried numerous alternative geometrical configurations for the lunar motions to improve matters further a notable success was achieved by jeremiah horrocks who proposed a scheme involving an approximate 6 monthly libration in the position of the lunar apogee and also in the size of the elliptical eccentricity this scheme had the great merit of giving a more realistic description of the changes in distance diameter and parallax of the moon


 newton 
a first gravitational period for lunar theory started with the work of newton he was the first to define the problem of the perturbed motion of the moon in recognisably modern terms his groundbreaking work is shown for example in the principia in all versions including the first edition published in 1687


 solar perturbation of lunar motion 
newton identified how to evaluate the perturbing effect on the relative motion of the earth and moon arising from their gravity towards the sun in book 1 proposition 66 and in book 3 proposition 25 the starting-point for this approach is corollary vi to the laws of motion this shows that if the external accelerative forces from some massive body happens to act equally and in parallel on some different other bodies considered then those bodies would be affected equally and in that case their motions relative to each other would continue as if there were no such external accelerative forces at all it is only in the case that the external forces eg in book 1 prop 66 and book 3 prop 25 the gravitational attractions towards the sun are different in size or in direction in their accelerative effects on the different bodies considered eg on the earth and moon that consequent effects are appreciable on the relative motions of the latter bodies newton referred to accelerative forces or accelerative gravity due to some external massive attractor such as the sun the measure he used was the acceleration that the force tends to produce in modern terms force per unit mass rather than what we would now call the force itself
thus newton concluded that it is only the difference between the suns accelerative attraction on the moon and the suns attraction on the earth that perturbs the motion of the moon relative to the earth
newton then in effect used vector decomposition of forces to carry out this analysis in book 1 proposition 66 and in book 3 proposition 25 he showed by a geometrical construction starting from the total gravitational attraction of the sun on the earth and of the sun on the moon the difference that represents the perturbing effect on the motion of the moon relative to the earth in summary line ls in newtons diagram as shown below represents the size and direction of the perturbing acceleration acting on the moon in the moons current position p line ls does not pass through point p but the text shows that this is not intended to be significant it is a result of the scale factors and the way the diagram has been built up

shown here is newtons diagram from the first 1687 latin edition of the principia book 3 proposition 25 at p 434 here he introduced his analysis of perturbing accelerations on the moon in the sun-earth-moon system q represents the sun s the earth and p the moon
parts of this diagram represent distances other parts gravitational accelerations attractive forces per unit mass in a dual significance sq represents the earth-sun distance and then it also represents the size and direction of the earth-sun gravitational acceleration other distances in the diagram are then in proportion to distance sq other attractions are in proportion to attraction sq
the suns attractions are sq on the earth and lq on the moon the size of lq is drawn so that the ratio of attractions lqsq is the inverse square of the ratio of distances pqsq newton constructs kqsq giving an easier view of the proportions the earths attraction on the moon acts along direction ps but line ps signifies only distance and direction so far nothing has been defined about the scale factor between solar and terrestrial attractions
after showing solar attractions lq on the moon and sq on the earth on the same scale newton then makes a vector decomposition of lq into components lm and mq then he identifies the perturbing acceleration on the moon as the difference of this from sq sq and mq are parallel to each other so sq can be directly subtracted from mq leaving ms the resulting difference after subtracting sq from lq is therefore the vector sum of lm and ms these add up to a perturbing acceleration ls
later newton identified another resolution of the perturbing acceleration lmms  ls into orthogonal components a transverse component parallel to le and a radial component effectively es

newtons diagrammatic scheme since his time has been re-presented in other and perhaps visually clearer ways shown here is a vector presentation indicating for two different positions p1 and p2 of the moon in its orbit around the earth the respective vectors ls1 and ls2 for the perturbing acceleration due to the sun the moons position at p1 is fairly close to what it was at p in newtons diagram corresponding perturbation ls1 is like newtons ls in size and direction at another position p2 the moon is farther away from the sun than the earth is the suns attraction lq2 on the moon is weaker than the suns attraction sqsq2 on the earth and then the resulting perturbation ls2 points obliquely away from the sun

constructions like those in newtons diagram can be repeated for many different positions of the moon in its orbit for each position the result is a perturbation vector like ls1 or ls2 in the second diagram shown here is an often-presented form of the diagram that summarises sizes and directions of the perturbation vectors for many different positions of the moon in its orbit each small arrow is a perturbation vector like ls applicable to the moon in the particular position around the orbit from which the arrow begins the perturbations on the moon when it is nearly in line along the earth-sun axis ie near new or full moon point outwards away from the earth when the moon-earth line is 90° from the earth-sun axis they point inwards towards the earth with a size that is only half the maximum size of the axial outwards perturbations newton gave a rather good quantitative estimate for the size of the solar perturbing force at quadrature where it adds to the earths attraction he put it at ​1⁄178.725 of the mean terrestrial attraction and twice as much as that at the new and full moons where it opposes and diminishes the earths attraction
newton also showed that the same pattern of perturbation applies not only to the moon in its relation to the earth as disturbed by the sun but also to other particles more generally in their relation to the solid earth as disturbed by the sun or by the moon for example different portions of the tidal waters at the earths surface the study of the common pattern of these perturbing accelerations grew out of newtons initial study of the perturbations of the moon which he also applied to the forces moving tidal waters nowadays this common pattern itself has become often known as a tidal force whether it is being applied to the disturbances of the motions of the moon or of the earths tidal waters – or of the motions of any other object that suffers perturbations of analogous pattern
after introducing his diagram to find the force of the sun to perturb the moon in book 3 proposition 25 newton developed a first approximation to the solar perturbing force showing in further detail how its components vary as the moon follows its monthly path around the earth he also took the first steps in investigating how the perturbing force shows its effects by producing irregularities in the lunar motions in this part of the enterprise newtons success was more limited it is relatively uncomplicated to define the perturbing forces but heavy complexities soon arise in the problem of working out the resulting motions and these were to challenge mathematical astronomers for two centuries after newtons initial definition of the problem and indication of the directions to take in solving it
for a selected few of the lunar inequalities newton showed in some quantitative detail how they arise from the solar perturbing force
much of this lunar work of newtons was done in the 1680s and the extent and accuracy of his first steps in the gravitational analysis was limited by several factors including his own choice to develop and present the work in what was on the whole a difficult geometrical way and by the limited accuracy and uncertainty of many astronomical measurements in his time


 classical gravitational period after newton 
the main aim of newtons successors from leonhard euler alexis clairaut and jean dalembert in the mid-eighteenth century down to ew brown in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century was to account completely and much more precisely for the moons motions on the basis of newtons laws ie the laws of motion and of universal gravitation by attractions inversely proportional to the squares of the distances between the attracting bodies they also wished to put the inverse-square law of gravitation to the test and for a time in the 1740s it was seriously doubted on account of what was then thought to be a large discrepancy between the newton-theoretical and the observed rates in the motion of the lunar apogee however clairaut showed shortly afterwards 1749–50 that at least the major cause of the discrepancy lay not in the lunar theory based on newtons laws but in excessive approximations that he and others had relied on to evaluate it
most of the improvements in theory after newton were made in algebraic form they involved voluminous and highly laborious amounts of infinitesimal calculus and trigonometry it also remained necessary for completing the theories of this period to refer to observational measurements


 results of the theories 
the lunar theorists used and invented many different mathematical approaches to analyse the gravitational problem not surprisingly their results tended to converge from the time of the earliest gravitational analysts among newtons successors euler clairaut and dalembert it was recognized that nearly all of the main lunar perturbations could be expressed in terms of just a few angular arguments and coefficients these can be represented by
the mean motions or positions of the moon and the sun together with three coefficients and three angular positions which together define the shape and location of their apparent orbits

 largest or named lunar inequalities 
several of the largest lunar perturbations in longitude contributions to the difference in its true ecliptic longitude relative to its mean longitude have been named in terms of the differential arguments they can be expressed in the following way with coefficients rounded to the nearest second of arc 


 equation of the center 

the moons equation of the center or elliptic inequality was known at least in approximation to the ancients from the babylonians and hipparchus onwards knowledge of more recent date is that it corresponds to the approximate application of keplers law of equal areas in an elliptical orbit and represents the speeding-up of the moon as its distance from the earth decreases while it moves towards its perigee and then its slowing down as its distance from the earth increases while it moves towards its apogee the effect on the moons longitude can be approximated by a series of terms of which the first three are

 evection 

the evection or its approximation was known to ptolemy but its name and knowledge of its cause dates from the 17th century its effect on the moons longitude has an odd-appearing period of about 31.8 days this can be represented in a number of ways for example as the result of an approximate 6-monthly libration in the position of perigee with an accompanying 6-monthly pulsation in the size of the moons orbital eccentricity its principal term is

 variation

 annual equation 
the annual equation also discovered by brahe was qualitatively explained by newton in terms that the moons orbit becomes slightly expanded in size and longer in period when the earth is at perihelion closest to the sun at the beginning of january and the suns perturbing effect is strongest and then slightly contracted in size and shorter in period when the sun is most distant in early july so that its perturbing effect is weaker the modern value for the principal term due to this effect is

 parallactic inequality

 reduction to the ecliptic 
the reduction to the ecliptic represents the geometric effect of expressing the moons motion in terms of a longitude in the plane of the ecliptic although its motion is really taking place in a plane that is inclined by about 5 degrees its principal term is

the analysts of the mid-18th century expressed the perturbations of the moons position in longitude using about 25-30 trigonometrical terms however work in the nineteenth and twentieth century led to very different formulations of the theory so these terms are no longer current the number of terms needed to express the moons position with the accuracy sought at the beginning of the twentieth century was over 1400 and the number of terms needed to emulate the accuracy of modern numerical integrations based on laser-ranging observations is in the tens of thousands there is no limit to the increase in number of terms needed as requirements of accuracy increase


 modern developments 


 digital computers and lunar laser ranging 

since the second world war and especially since the 1960s lunar theory has been further developed in a somewhat different way this has been stimulated in two ways on the one hand by the use of automatic digital computation and on the other hand by modern observational data-types with greatly increased accuracy and precision
wallace john eckert a student of ernest william brown who worked at ibm used the experimental digital computers developed there after the second world war for computation of astronomical ephemerides one of the projects was to put browns lunar theory into the machine and evaluate the expressions directly another project was something entirely new a numerical integration of the equations of motion for the sun and the four major planets this became feasible only after electronic digital computers became available eventually this led to the jet propulsion laboratory development ephemeris series
in the meantime browns theory was improved with better constants and the introduction of ephemeris time and the removal of some empirical corrections associated with this this led to the improved lunar ephemeris ile which with some minor successive improvements was used in the astronomical almanacs from 1960 through 1983 ile j0 from 1960 to 1967 ile j1 from 1968 to 1971 ile j2 from 1972 to 1983 and was used in lunar landing missions
the most significant improvement of position observations of the moon have been the lunar laser ranging measurements obtained using earth-bound lasers and special retro-reflectors placed on the surface of the moon the time-of-flight of a pulse of laser light to one of the reflectors and back gives a measure of the moons distance at that time the first of five reflectors that are operational today was taken to the moon in the apollo 11 spacecraft in july 1969 and placed in a suitable position on the moons surface by neil armstrong its precision is still being extended further by the apache point observatory lunar laser-ranging operation established in 2005

the lunar theory as developed numerically to fine precision using these modern measures is based on a larger range of considerations than the classical theories it takes account not only of gravitational forces with relativistic corrections but also of many tidal and geophysical effects and a greatly extended theory of lunar libration like many other scientific fields this one has now developed so as to be based on the work of large teams and institutions an institution notably taking one of the leading parts in these developments has been the jet propulsion laboratory at california institute of technology and names particularly associated with the transition from the early 1970s onwards from classical lunar theories and ephemerides towards the modern state of the science include those of j derral mulholland and j g williams and for the linked development of solar system planetary ephemerides e myles standish
since the 1970s the jet propulsion laboratory jpl has produced a series of numerically integrated development ephemerides numbered dexxx incorporating lunar ephemerides lexxx planetary and lunar ephemerides de200le200 were used in the official astronomical almanac ephemerides for 1984–2002 and ephemerides de405le405 of further improved accuracy and precision have been in use as from the issue for 2003


 analytical developments 
in parallel with these developments a new class of analytical lunar theory has also been developed in recent years notably the ephemeride lunaire parisienne by jean chapront and michelle chapront-touzé from the bureau des longitudes using computer-assisted algebra the analytical developments have been taken further than previously could be done by the classical analysts working manually also some of these new analytical theories like elp have been fitted to the numerical ephemerides previously developed at jpl as mentioned above the main aims of these recent analytical theories in contrast to the aims of the classical theories of past centuries have not been to generate improved positional data for current dates rather their aims have included the study of further aspects of the motion such as long-term properties which may not so easily be apparent from the modern numerical theories themselves
