in astronomy a double planet also binary planet is a binary system where both objects are of planetary mass the term is not recognized by the international astronomical union iau and is therefore not an official classification at its 2006 general assembly the international astronomical union considered a proposal that pluto and charon be reclassified as a double planet but the proposal was abandoned in favor of the current definition of planet in promotional materials advertising the smart-1 mission and pre-dating the iau planet definition the european space agency once referred to the earth–moon system as a double planet
some binary asteroids with components of roughly equal mass are sometimes informally referred to as double minor planets these include binary asteroids 69230 hermes and 90 antiope and binary kuiper belt objects kbos 79360 sila–nunam and 1998 ww31


 definition of double planet 

there is debate as to what criteria should be used to distinguish double planet from a planet–moon system the following are considerations


 both bodies satisfy planet criterion 
a definition proposed in the astronomical journal calls for both bodies to individually satisfy an orbit-clearing criterion in order to be called a double planet


 mass ratios closer to 1 
one important consideration in defining double planet is the ratio of the masses of the two bodies a mass ratio of 1 would indicate bodies of equal mass and bodies with mass ratios closer to 1 are more attractive to label as doubles using this definition the satellites of mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune can all easily be excluded they all have masses less than 0.00025 ​1⁄4000 of the planets around which they revolve some dwarf planets too have satellites substantially less massive than the dwarf planets themselves
the most notable exception is the pluto–charon system the charon-to-pluto mass ratio of 0.117 ≈ ​2⁄17 is close enough to 1 that pluto and charon have frequently been described by many scientists as double dwarf planets double planets prior to the 2006 definition of planet the international astronomical union iau currently calls charon a satellite of pluto but has explicitly expressed a willingness to reconsider the bodies double dwarf planets at a future time
the moon-to-earth mass ratio of 0.01230 ≈ ​1⁄81 is also notably close to 1 when compared to all other satellite-to-planet ratios consequently some scientists view the earth-moon system as a double planet as well though this is a minority view eriss lone satellite dysnomia has a radius somewhere around ​1⁄4 that of eris assuming similar densities dysnomias compositional make-up may or may not differ substantially from eriss the mass ratio would be near ​1⁄40 a value intermediate to the moon–earth and charon–pluto ratios
the next criteria both attempt to answer the question how close to 1 must the mass ratio be


 center-of-mass position 
currently the most commonly proposed definition for a double-planet system is one in which the barycenter around which both bodies orbit lies outside both bodies under this definition pluto and charon are double dwarf planets since they orbit a point clearly outside of pluto as visible in animations created from images of the new horizons space probe in june 2015
under this definition the earth–moon system is not currently a double planet although the moon is massive enough to cause the earth to make a noticeable revolution around this center of mass this point nevertheless lies well within earth however the moon migrates outward from earth at a rate of approximately 3.8 cm 1.5 in per year in a few hundred million years the earth–moon systems center of mass will lie outside earth which would make it a double-planet system
it is interesting to note that the center of mass of the jupiter–sun system lies outside the surface of the sun though arguing that jupiter is a double star is not analogous to arguing charon is a double planet the problem is that one cannot argue that jupiter is even a star—even a brown dwarf—due to its low mass and associated inability to support any type of fusion


 tug-of-war value 
isaac asimov suggested a distinction between planet–moon and double-planet structures based in part on what he called a tug-of-war value which does not consider their relative sizes this quantity is simply the ratio of the force exerted on the smaller body by the larger primary body to the force exerted on the smaller body by the sun this can be shown to equal

where mp is the mass of the primary the larger body ms is the mass of the sun ds is the distance between the smaller body and the sun and dp is the distance between the smaller body and the primary note that the tug-of-war value does not rely on the mass of the satellite the smaller body
this formula actually reflects the relation of the gravitational effects on the smaller body from the larger body and from the sun the tug-of-war figure for saturns moon titan is 380 which means that saturns hold on titan is 380 times as strong as the suns hold on titan titans tug-of-war value may be compared with that of saturns moon phoebe which has a tug-of-war value of just 3.5 so saturns hold on phoebe is only 3.5 times as strong as the suns hold on phoebe
asimov calculated tug-of-war values for several satellites of the planets he showed that even the largest gas giant jupiter had only a slightly better hold than the sun on its outer captured satellites some with tug-of-war values not much higher than one in nearly every one of asimovs calculations the tug-of-war value was found to be greater than one so in those cases the sun loses the tug-of-war with the planets the one exception was earths moon where the sun wins the tug-of-war with a value of 0.46 which means that earths hold on the moon is less than half that of the suns asimov included this with his other arguments that earth and the moon should be considered a binary planet

we might look upon the moon then as neither a true satellite of the earth nor a captured one but as a planet in its own right moving about the sun in careful step with the earth from within the earth–moon system the simplest way of picturing the situation is to have the moon revolve about the earth but if you were to draw a picture of the orbits of the earth and moon about the sun exactly to scale you would see that the moons orbit is everywhere concave toward the sun it is always falling toward the sun all the other satellites without exception fall away from the sun through part of their orbits caught as they are by the superior pull of their primary planets – but not the moon

see the path of earth and moon around sun section in the orbit of the moon article for a more detailed explanation
note that this definition of double planet depends on the pairs distance from the sun if the earth–moon system happened to orbit farther away from the sun than it does now then earth would win the tug of war for example at the orbit of mars the moons tug-of-war value would be 1.05 also several tiny moons discovered since asimovs proposal would qualify as double planets by this argument neptunes small outer moons neso and psamathe for example have tug-of-war values of 0.42 and 0.44 less than that of earths moon yet their masses are tiny compared to neptunes with an estimated ratio of 1.5×10−9 ​1⁄700,000,000 and 0.4×10−9 ​1⁄2,500,000,000


 formation of the system 
a final consideration is the way in which the two bodies came to form a system both the earth-moon and pluto-charon systems are thought to have been formed as a result of giant impacts one body was impacted by a second body resulting in a debris disk and through accretion either two new bodies formed or one new body formed with the larger body remaining but changed however a giant impact is not a sufficient condition for two bodies being double planets because such impacts can also produce tiny satellites such as the four small outer satellites of pluto
a now-abandoned hypothesis for the origin of the moon was actually called the double-planet hypothesis the idea was that the earth and the moon formed in the same region of the solar systems proto-planetary disk forming a system under gravitational interaction this idea too is a problematic condition for defining two bodies as double planets because planets can capture moons through gravitational interaction for example the moons of mars phobos and deimos are thought to be asteroids captured long ago by mars such a weak definition would also deem neptune-triton a double planet since triton was a kuiper belt body the same size and of similar composition to pluto later captured by neptune
