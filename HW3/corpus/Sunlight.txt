sunlight is a portion of the electromagnetic radiation given off by the sun in particular infrared visible and ultraviolet light on earth sunlight is filtered through earths atmosphere and is obvious as daylight when the sun is above the horizon when the direct solar radiation is not blocked by clouds it is experienced as sunshine a combination of bright light and radiant heat when it is blocked by clouds or reflects off other objects it is experienced as diffused light the world meteorological organization uses the term sunshine duration to mean the cumulative time during which an area receives direct irradiance from the sun of at least 120 watts per square meter other sources indicate an average over the entire earth of 164 watts per square meter over a 24 hour day
the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight has both positive and negative health effects as it is both a principal source of vitamin d3 and a mutagen
sunlight takes about 8.3 minutes to reach earth from the surface of the sun a photon starting at the center of the sun and changing direction every time it encounters a charged particle would take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to get to the surface
sunlight is a key factor in photosynthesis the process used by plants and other autotrophic organisms to convert light energy normally from the sun into chemical energy that can be used to fuel the organisms activities


 measurement 
researchers can measure the intensity of sunlight using a sunshine recorder pyranometer or pyrheliometer to calculate the amount of sunlight reaching the ground both the eccentricity of earths elliptic orbit and the attenuation by earths atmosphere have to be taken into account the extraterrestrial solar illuminance eext corrected for the elliptic orbit by using the day number of the year dn is given to a good approximation by

where c is the atmospheric extinction and m is the relative optical airmass the atmospheric extinction brings the number of lux down to around 100 000
the total amount of energy received at ground level from the sun at the zenith depends on the distance to the sun and thus on the time of year it is about 3.3% higher than average in january and 3.3% lower in july see below if the extraterrestrial solar radiation is 1367 watts per square meter the value when the earth–sun distance is 1 astronomical unit then the direct sunlight at earths surface when the sun is at the zenith is about 1050 wm2 but the total amount direct and indirect from the atmosphere hitting the ground is around 1120 wm2 in terms of energy sunlight at earths surface is around 52 to 55 percent infrared above 700 nm 42 to 43 percent visible 400 to 700 nm and 3 to 5 percent ultraviolet below 400 nm at the top of the atmosphere sunlight is about 30% more intense having about 8% ultraviolet uv with most of the extra uv consisting of biologically damaging short-wave ultraviolet
direct sunlight has a luminous efficacy of about 93 lumens per watt of radiant flux this is higher than the efficacy of source of most artificial lighting including fluorescent which means using sunlight for illumination heats up a room less than using most forms of artificial lighting
multiplying the figure of 1050 watts per square metre by 93 lumens per watt indicates that bright sunlight provides an illuminance of approximately 98 000 lux lumens per square meter on a perpendicular surface at sea level the illumination of a horizontal surface will be considerably less than this if the sun is not very high in the sky averaged over a day the highest amount of sunlight on a horizontal surface occurs in january at the south pole see insolation
dividing the irradiance of 1050 wm2 by the size of the suns disk in steradians gives an average radiance of 15.4 mw per square metre per steradian however the radiance at the centre of the suns disk is somewhat higher than the average over the whole disk due to limb darkening multiplying this by π gives an upper limit to the irradiance which can be focused on a surface using mirrors 48.5 mwm2


 composition and power 

the spectrum of the suns solar radiation is close to that of a black body with a temperature of about 5,800 k the sun emits em radiation across most of the electromagnetic spectrum although the sun produces gamma rays as a result of the nuclear-fusion process internal absorption and thermalization convert these super-high-energy photons to lower-energy photons before they reach the suns surface and are emitted out into space as a result the sun does not emit gamma rays from this process but it does emit gamma rays from solar flares the sun also emits x-rays ultraviolet visible light infrared and even radio waves the only direct signature of the nuclear process is the emission of neutrinos
although the solar corona is a source of extreme ultraviolet and x-ray radiation these rays make up only a very small amount of the power output of the sun see spectrum at right the spectrum of nearly all solar electromagnetic radiation striking the earths atmosphere spans a range of 100 nm to about 1 mm 1,000,000 nm this band of significant radiation power can be divided into five regions in increasing order of wavelengths
ultraviolet c or uvc range which spans a range of 100 to 280 nm the term ultraviolet refers to the fact that the radiation is at higher frequency than violet light and hence also invisible to the human eye due to absorption by the atmosphere very little reaches earths surface this spectrum of radiation has germicidal properties as used in germicidal lamps
ultraviolet b or uvb range spans 280 to 315 nm it is also greatly absorbed by the earths atmosphere and along with uvc causes the photochemical reaction leading to the production of the ozone layer it directly damages dna and causes sunburn but is also required for vitamin d synthesis in the skin and fur of mammals
ultraviolet a or uva spans 315 to 400 nm this band was once held to be less damaging to dna and hence is used in cosmetic artificial sun tanning tanning booths and tanning beds and puva therapy for psoriasis however uva is now known to cause significant damage to dna via indirect routes formation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species and can cause cancer
visible range or light spans 380 to 780 nm as the name suggests this range is visible to the naked eye it is also the strongest output range of the suns total irradiance spectrum
infrared range that spans 700 nm to 1,000,000 nm 1 mm it comprises an important part of the electromagnetic radiation that reaches earth scientists divide the infrared range into three types on the basis of wavelength
infrared-a 700 nm to 1,400 nm
infrared-b 1,400 nm to 3,000 nm
infrared-c 3,000 nm to 1 mm


 published tables 
tables of direct solar radiation on various slopes from 0 to 60 degrees north latitude in calories per square centimetre issued in 1972 and published by pacific northwest forest and range experiment station forest service us department of agriculture portland oregon usa appear on the web


 solar constant 

the solar constant a measure of flux density is the amount of incoming solar electromagnetic radiation per unit area that would be incident on a plane perpendicular to the rays at a distance of one astronomical unit au roughly the mean distance from the sun to earth the solar constant includes all types of solar radiation not just the visible light its average value was thought to be approximately 1366 wm² varying slightly with solar activity but recent recalibrations of the relevant satellite observations indicate a value closer to 1361 wm² is more realistic


 total solar irradiance tsi and spectral solar irradiance ssi upon earth 
 total solar irradiance tsi – the amount of solar radiation received at the top of earths atmosphere – has been measured since 1978 by a series of overlapping nasa and esa satellite experiments to be 1.361 kilo⁠watts per square meter kwm² tsi observations are continuing today with the acrimsatacrim3 sohovirgo and sorcetim satellite experiments variation of tsi has been discovered on many timescales including the solar magnetic cycle  and many shorter periodic cycles tsi provides the energy that drives earths climate so continuation of the tsi time series database is critical to understanding the role of solar variability in climate change
spectral solar irradiance ssi – the spectral distribution of the tsi – has been monitored since 2003 by the sorce spectral irradiance monitor sim it has been found that ssi at uv ultraviolet wavelength corresponds in a less clear and probably more complicated fashion with earths climate responses than earlier assumed fueling broad avenues of new research in “the connection of the sun and stratosphere troposphere biosphere ocean and earth’s climate”


 intensity in the solar system 

different bodies of the solar system receive light of an intensity inversely proportional to the square of their distance from sun a rough table comparing the amount of solar radiation received by each planet in the solar system follows from data in 1
the actual brightness of sunlight that would be observed at the surface depends also on the presence and composition of an atmosphere for example venuss thick atmosphere reflects more than 60% of the solar light it receives the actual illumination of the surface is about 14,000 lux comparable to that on earth in the daytime with overcast clouds
sunlight on mars would be more or less like daylight on earth during a slightly overcast day and as can be seen in the pictures taken by the rovers there is enough diffuse sky radiation that shadows would not seem particularly dark thus it would give perceptions and feel very much like earth daylight the spectrum on the surface is slightly redder than that on earth due to scattering by reddish dust in the martian atmosphere
for comparison sunlight on saturn is slightly brighter than earth sunlight at the average sunset or sunrise see daylight for comparison table even on pluto the sunlight would still be bright enough to almost match the average living room to see sunlight as dim as full moonlight on earth a distance of about 500 au 69 light-hours is needed there are only a handful of objects in the solar system known to orbit farther than such a distance among them 90377 sedna and 87269 2000 oo67


 surface illumination 
the spectrum of surface illumination depends upon solar elevation due to atmospheric effects with the blue spectral component dominating during twilight before and after sunrise and sunset respectively and red dominating during sunrise and sunset these effects are apparent in natural light photography where the principal source of illumination is sunlight as mediated by the atmosphere
while the color of the sky is usually determined by rayleigh scattering an exception occurs at sunset and twilight preferential absorption of sunlight by ozone over long horizon paths gives the zenith sky its blueness when the sun is near the horizon
see diffuse sky radiation for more details


 spectral composition of sunlight at earths surface 
the suns electromagnetic radiation which is received at the earths surface is predominantly light that falls within the range of wavelengths to which the visual systems of the animals that inhabit earths surface are sensitive the sun may therefore be said to illuminate which is a measure of the light within a specific sensitivity range many animals including humans have a sensitivity range of approximately 400–700 nm and given optimal conditions the absorption and scattering by earths atmosphere produces illumination that approximates an equal-energy illuminant for most of this range the useful range for color vision in humans for example is approximately 450–650 nm aside from effects that arise at sunset and sunrise the spectral composition changes primarily in respect to how directly sunlight is able to illuminate when illumination is indirect rayleigh scattering in the upper atmosphere will lead blue wavelengths to dominate water vapour in the lower atmosphere produces further scattering and ozone dust and water particles will also absorb selective wavelengths


 variations in solar irradiance 


 seasonal and orbital variation 

on earth the solar radiation varies with the angle of the sun above the horizon with longer sunlight duration at high latitudes during summer varying to no sunlight at all in winter near the pertinent pole when the direct radiation is not blocked by clouds it is experienced as sunshine the warming of the ground and other objects depends on the absorption of the electromagnetic radiation in the form of heat
the amount of radiation intercepted by a planetary body varies inversely with the square of the distance between the star and the planet earths orbit and obliquity change with time over thousands of years sometimes forming a nearly perfect circle and at other times stretching out to an orbital eccentricity of 5% currently 1.67 as the orbital eccentricity changes the average distance from the sun the semimajor axis does not significantly vary and so the total insolation over a year remains almost constant due to keplers second law

if we assume the solar radiation power p as a constant over time and the solar irradiation given by the inverse-square law we obtain also the average insolation as a constant
but the seasonal and latitudinal distribution and intensity of solar radiation received at earths surface does vary the effect of sun angle on climate results in the change in solar energy in summer and winter for example at latitudes of 65 degrees this can vary by more than 25% as a result of earths orbital variation because changes in winter and summer tend to offset the change in the annual average insolation at any given location is near zero but the redistribution of energy between summer and winter does strongly affect the intensity of seasonal cycles such changes associated with the redistribution of solar energy are considered a likely cause for the coming and going of recent ice ages see milankovitch cycles


 solar intensity variation 

space-based observations of solar irradiance started in 1978 these measurements show that the solar constant is not constant it varies on many time scales including the 11-year sunspot solar cycle when going further back in time one has to rely on irradiance reconstructions using sunspots for the past 400 years or cosmogenic radionuclides for going back 10,000 years such reconstructions have been done these studies show that in addition to the solar irradiance variation with the solar cycle the schwabe cycle the solar activitiy varies with longer cycles such as the proposed 88 year gleisberg cycle 208 year devries cycle and 1,000 year eddy cycle


 life on earth 
the existence of nearly all life on earth is fueled by light from the sun most autotrophs such as plants use the energy of sunlight combined with carbon dioxide and water to produce simple sugars—a process known as photosynthesis these sugars are then used as building-blocks and in other synthetic pathways that allow the organism to grow
heterotrophs such as animals use light from the sun indirectly by consuming the products of autotrophs either by consuming autotrophs by consuming their products or by consuming other heterotrophs the sugars and other molecular components produced by the autotrophs are then broken down releasing stored solar energy and giving the heterotroph the energy required for survival this process is known as cellular respiration
in prehistory humans began to further extend this process by putting plant and animal materials to other uses they used animal skins for warmth for example or wooden weapons to hunt these skills allowed humans to harvest more of the sunlight than was possible through glycolysis alone and human population began to grow
during the neolithic revolution the domestication of plants and animals further increased human access to solar energy fields devoted to crops were enriched by inedible plant matter providing sugars and nutrients for future harvests animals that had previously provided humans with only meat and tools once they were killed were now used for labour throughout their lives fueled by grasses inedible to humans
the more recent discoveries of coal petroleum and natural gas are modern extensions of this trend these fossil fuels are the remnants of ancient plant and animal matter formed using energy from sunlight and then trapped within earth for millions of years because the stored energy in these fossil fuels has accumulated over many millions of years they have allowed modern humans to massively increase the production and consumption of primary energy as the amount of fossil fuel is large but finite this cannot continue indefinitely and various theories exist as to what will follow this stage of human civilization eg alternative fuels malthusian catastrophe new urbanism peak oil


 cultural aspects 

the effect of sunlight is relevant to painting evidenced for instance in works of claude monet on outdoor scenes and landscapes

many people find direct sunlight to be too bright for comfort especially when reading from white paper upon which the sun is directly shining indeed looking directly at the sun can cause long-term vision damage to compensate for the brightness of sunlight many people wear sunglasses cars many helmets and caps are equipped with visors to block the sun from direct vision when the sun is at a low angle sunshine is often blocked from entering buildings through the use of walls window blinds awnings shutters curtains or nearby shade trees
in colder countries many people prefer sunnier days and often avoid the shade in hotter countries the converse is true during the midday hours many people prefer to stay inside to remain cool if they do go outside they seek shade that may be provided by trees parasols and so on
in hinduism the sun is considered to be a god as it is the source of life and energy on earth


 sunbathing 

sunbathing is a popular leisure activity in which a person sits or lies in direct sunshine people often sunbathe in comfortable places where there is ample sunlight some common places for sunbathing include beaches open air swimming pools parks gardens and sidewalk cafes sunbathers typically wear limited amounts of clothing or some simply go nude for some an alternative to sunbathing is the use of a sunbed that generates ultraviolet light and can be used indoors regardless of weather conditions tanning beds have been banned in a number of states in the world
for many people with light skin one purpose for sunbathing is to darken ones skin color get a sun tan as this is considered in some cultures to be attractive associated with outdoor activity vacationsholidays and health some people prefer naked sunbathing so that an all-over or even tan can be obtained sometimes as part of a specific lifestyle
for people suffering from psoriasis sunbathing is an effective way of healing the symptoms
skin tanning is achieved by an increase in the dark pigment inside skin cells called melanocytes and is an automatic response mechanism of the body to sufficient exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun or from artificial sunlamps thus the tan gradually disappears with time when one is no longer exposed to these sources


 effects on human health 

the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight has both positive and negative health effects as it is both a principal source of vitamin d3 and a mutagen a dietary supplement can supply vitamin d without this mutagenic effect but bypasses natural mechanisms that would prevent overdoses of vitamin d generated internally from sunlight vitamin d has a wide range of positive health effects which include strengthening bones and possibly inhibiting the growth of some cancers sun exposure has also been associated with the timing of melatonin synthesis maintenance of normal circadian rhythms and reduced risk of seasonal affective disorder
long-term sunlight exposure is known to be associated with the development of skin cancer skin aging immune suppression and eye diseases such as cataracts and macular degeneration short-term overexposure is the cause of sunburn snow blindness and solar retinopathy
uv rays and therefore sunlight and sunlamps are the only listed carcinogens that are known to have health benefits and a number of public health organizations state that there needs to be a balance between the risks of having too much sunlight or too little there is a general consensus that sunburn should always be avoided
epidemiological data shows that people who have more exposure to the sun have less high blood pressure and cardiovascular-related mortality while sunlight and its uv rays are a risk factor for skin cancer sun avoidance may carry more of a cost than benefit for over-all good health a study found that there is no evidence that uv reduces lifespan in contrast to other risk factors like smoking alcohol and high blood pressure


 effect on plant genomes 
elevated solar uv-b doses increase the frequency of dna recombination in arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco nicotiana tabacum plants these increases are accompanied by strong induction of an enzyme with a key role in recombinational repair of dna damage thus the level of terrestrial solar uv-b radiation likely affects genome stability in plants
