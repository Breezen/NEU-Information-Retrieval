the annus mirabilis papers from latin annus mīrābilis extraordinary year are the papers of albert einstein published in the annalen der physik scientific journal in 1905 these four articles contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space time mass and energy the annus mirabilis is often called the miracle year in english or wunderjahr in german


 background 

at the time the papers were written einstein did not have easy access to a complete set of scientific reference materials although he did regularly read and contribute reviews to annalen der physik additionally scientific colleagues available to discuss his theories were few he worked as an examiner at the patent office in bern switzerland and he later said of a co-worker there michele besso that he could not have found a better sounding board for his ideas in all of europe in addition co-workers and the other members of the self-styled olympian academy maurice solovine and paul habicht and his wife mileva marić had some influence on einsteins work but how much is unclear
through these papers einstein tackles some of the eras most important physics questions and problems in 1900 lord kelvin in a lecture titled nineteenth-century clouds over the dynamical theory of heat and light suggested that physics had no satisfactory explanations for the results of the michelson–morley experiment and for black body radiation as introduced special relativity provided an account for the results of the michelson–morley experiments einsteins theories for the photoelectric effect extended the quantum theory which max planck had developed in his successful explanation of black body radiation
despite the greater fame achieved by his other works such as that on special relativity it was his work on the photoelectric effect that won him his nobel prize in 1921 for services to theoretical physics and especially for the discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect the nobel committee had waited patiently for experimental confirmation of special relativity however none was forthcoming until the time dilation experiments of ives and stilwell 1938 1941 and rossi and hall 1941

 photoelectric effect 

the article on a heuristic viewpoint concerning the production and transformation of light received march 18 and published june 9 proposed the idea of energy quanta this idea motivated by max plancks earlier derivation of the law of black body radiation assumes that luminous energy can be absorbed or emitted only in discrete amounts called quanta einstein states

energy during the propagation of a ray of light is not continuously distributed over steadily increasing spaces but it consists of a finite number of energy quanta localised at points in space moving without dividing and capable of being absorbed or generated only as entities

in explaining the photoelectric effect the hypothesis that energy consists of discrete packets as einstein illustrates can be directly applied to black bodies as well
the idea of light quanta contradicts the wave theory of light that follows naturally from james clerk maxwells equations for electromagnetic behavior and more generally the assumption of infinite divisibility of energy in physical systems

a profound formal difference exists between the theoretical concepts that physicists have formed about gases and other ponderable bodies and maxwells theory of electromagnetic processes in so-called empty space while we consider the state of a body to be completely determined by the positions and velocities of an indeed very large yet finite number of atoms and electrons we make use of continuous spatial functions to determine the electromagnetic state of a volume of space so that a finite number of quantities cannot be considered as sufficient for the complete determination of the electromagnetic state of space
 this leads to contradictions when applied to the phenomena of emission and transformation of light
according to the view that the incident light consists of energy quanta  the production of cathode rays by light can be conceived in the following way the bodys surface layer is penetrated by energy quanta whose energy is converted at least partially into kinetic energy of the electrons the simplest conception is that a light quantum transfers its entire energy to a single electron 

einstein noted that the photoelectric effect depended on the wavelength and hence the frequency of the light at too low a frequency even intense light produced no electrons however once a certain frequency was reached even low intensity light produced electrons he compared this to plancks hypothesis that light could be emitted only in packets of energy given by hf where h is plancks constant and f is the frequency he then postulated that light travels in packets whose energy depends on the frequency and therefore only light above a certain frequency would bring sufficient energy to liberate an electron
even after experiments confirmed that einsteins equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate his explanation was not universally accepted niels bohr in his 1922 nobel address stated the hypothesis of light-quanta is not able to throw light on the nature of radiation
by 1921 when einstein was awarded the nobel prize and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name in the award citation some physicists accepted that the equation

   was correct and light quanta were possible in 1923 arthur comptons x-ray scattering experiment helped more of the scientific community to accept this formula the theory of light quanta was a strong indicator of wave-particle duality a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics a complete picture of the theory of photoelectricity was realized after the maturity of quantum mechanics


 brownian motion 

the article über die von der molekularkinetischen theorie der wärme geforderte bewegung von in ruhenden flüssigkeiten suspendierten teilchen on the motion of small particles suspended in a stationary liquid as required by the molecular kinetic theory of heat received may 11 and published july 18 delineated a stochastic model of brownian motion

in this paper it will be shown that according to the molecular kinetic theory of heat bodies of a microscopically visible size suspended in liquids must as a result of thermal molecular motions perform motions of such magnitudes that they can be easily observed with a microscope it is possible that the motions to be discussed here are identical with so-called brownian molecular motion however the data available to me on the latter are so imprecise that i could not form a judgment on the question

einstein derived expressions for the mean squared displacement of particles using the kinetic theory of gases which at the time was controversial the article established that the phenomenon which had lacked a satisfactory explanation even decades after it was first observed provided empirical evidence for the reality of the atom it also lent credence to statistical mechanics which had been controversial at that time as well before this paper atoms were recognized as a useful concept but physicists and chemists debated whether atoms were real entities einsteins statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope wilhelm ostwald one of the leaders of the anti-atom school later told arnold sommerfeld that he had been convinced of the existence of atoms by jean perrins subsequent brownian motion experiments


 special relativity 

einsteins zur elektrodynamik bewegter körper on the electrodynamics of moving bodies his third paper that year was received on june 30 and published september 26 it reconciles maxwells equations for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics by introducing major changes to mechanics close to the speed of light this later became known as einsteins special theory of relativity
the paper mentions the names of only five other scientists isaac newton james clerk maxwell heinrich hertz christian doppler and hendrik lorentz it does not have any references to any other publications many of the ideas had already been published by others as detailed in history of special relativity and relativity priority dispute however einsteins paper introduces a theory of time distance mass and energy that was consistent with electromagnetism but omitted the force of gravity
at the time it was known that maxwells equations when applied to moving bodies led to asymmetries moving magnet and conductor problem and that it had not been possible to discover any motion of the earth relative to the light medium ie aether einstein puts forward two postulates to explain these observations first he applies the principle of relativity which states that the laws of physics remain the same for any non-accelerating frame of reference called an inertial reference frame to the laws of electrodynamics and optics as well as mechanics in the second postulate einstein proposes that the speed of light has the same value in all inertial frames of reference independent of the state of motion of the emitting body
special relativity is thus consistent with the result of the michelson–morley experiment which had not detected a medium of conductance or aether for light waves unlike other known waves that require a medium such as water or air einstein may not have known about that experiment but states

examples of this sort together with the unsuccessful attempts to discover any motion of the earth relatively to the light medium suggest that the phenomena of electrodynamics as well as of mechanics possess no properties corresponding to the idea of absolute rest

the speed of light is fixed and thus not relative to the movement of the observer this was impossible under newtonian classical mechanics einstein argues

the same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the equations of mechanics hold good we will raise this conjecture the purport of which will hereafter be called the principle of relativity to the status of a postulate and also introduce another postulate which is only apparently irreconcilable with the former namely that light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body these two postulates suffice for the attainment of a simple and consistent theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies based on maxwells theory for stationary bodies the introduction of a luminiferous ether will prove to be superfluous in as much as the view here to be developed will not require an absolutely stationary space provided with special properties nor assign a velocity-vector to a point of the empty space in which electromagnetic processes take place
the theory … is based—like all electrodynamics—on the kinematics of the rigid body since the assertions of any such theory have to do with the relationships between rigid bodies systems of co-ordinates clocks and electromagnetic processes insufficient consideration of this circumstance lies at the root of the difficulties which the electrodynamics of moving bodies at present encounters

it had previously been proposed by george fitzgerald in 1889 and by lorentz in 1892 independently of each other that the michelson-morley result could be accounted for if moving bodies were contracted in the direction of their motion some of the papers core equations the lorentz transforms had been published by joseph larmor 1897 1900 hendrik lorentz 1895 1899 1904 and henri poincaré 1905 in a development of lorentzs 1904 paper einsteins presentation differed from the explanations given by fitzgerald larmor and lorentz but was similar in many respects to the formulation by poincaré 1905
his explanation arises from two axioms first galileos idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other einstein writes

the laws by which the states of physical systems undergo change are not affected whether these changes of state be referred to the one or the other of two systems of co-ordinates in uniform translatory motion

the second is the rule that the speed of light is the same for every observer

any ray of light moves in the stationary system of co-ordinates with the determined velocity c whether the ray be emitted by a stationary or by a moving body

the theory now called the special theory of relativity distinguishes it from his later general theory of relativity which considers all observers to be equivalent special relativity gained widespread acceptance remarkably quickly confirming einsteins comment that it had been ripe for discovery in 1905 acknowledging the role of max planck in the early dissemination of his ideas einstein wrote in 1913 the attention that this theory so quickly received from colleagues is surely to be ascribed in large part to the resoluteness and warmth with which he planck intervened for this theory in addition the improved mathematical formulation of the theory by hermann minkowski in 1907 was influential in gaining acceptance for the theory also and most importantly the theory was supported by an ever-increasing body of confirmatory experimental evidence


 mass–energy equivalence 

on november 21 annalen der physik published a fourth paper received september 27 ist die trägheit eines körpers von seinem energieinhalt abhängig does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy content in which einstein deduced what is arguably the most famous of all equations e  mc2
einstein considered the equivalency equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that a massive particle possesses an energy the rest energy distinct from its classical kinetic and potential energies the paper is based on james clerk maxwells and heinrich rudolf hertzs investigations and in addition the axioms of relativity as einstein states

the results of the previous investigation lead to a very interesting conclusion which is here to be deduced
the previous investigation was based on the maxwell–hertz equations for empty space together with the maxwellian expression for the electromagnetic energy of space 
the laws by which the states of physical systems alter are independent of the alternative to which of two systems of coordinates in uniform motion of parallel translation relatively to each other these alterations of state are referred principle of relativity

the equation sets forth that energy of a body at rest e equals its mass m times the speed of light c squared or e  mc2

if a body gives off the energy l in the form of radiation its mass diminishes by lc2 the fact that the energy withdrawn from the body becomes energy of radiation evidently makes no difference so that we are led to the more general conclusion that
the mass of a body is a measure of its energy-content if the energy changes by l the mass changes in the same sense by l9 × 1020 the energy being measured in ergs and the mass in grammes

if the theory corresponds to the facts radiation conveys inertia between the emitting and absorbing bodies

the mass-energy relation can be used to predict how much energy will be released or consumed by nuclear reactions one simply measures the mass of all constituents and the mass of all the products and multiplies the difference between the two by c2 the result shows how much energy will be released or consumed usually in the form of light or heat when applied to certain nuclear reactions the equation shows that an extraordinarily large amount of energy will be released much larger than in the combustion of chemical explosives where the mass difference is hardly measurable at all this explains why nuclear weapons produce such phenomenal amounts of energy as they release binding energy during nuclear fission and nuclear fusion and also convert a much larger portion of subatomic mass to energy


 commemoration 
the international union of pure and applied physics iupap resolved to commemorate the 100th year of the publication of einsteins extensive work in 1905 as the world year of physics 2005 this was subsequently endorsed by the united nations
