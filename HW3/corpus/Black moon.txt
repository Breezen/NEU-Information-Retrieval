 paganism 
in some aspects of paganism particularly amongst wiccans the black moon is considered to be a special time when any rituals spells or other workings are considered to be more powerful and effective others do not believe any rituals or workings should be conducted at these times


 criticism of terminology 
the term black moon is not formally established in astronomy and is used at best in the popularization of astronomy
there is no single definition of the term black moon
the new moon itself cannot be observed
the lack of a new or full moon in february can only be assigned to the month not to any particular date as such this is also not observable
the event of a black moon is an artefact of how the gregorian calendar or the seasons map onto lunations there is no physical or geometric difference between a black moon and other instances of a new moon
