black-body radiation is the thermal electromagnetic radiation within or surrounding a body in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment or emitted by a black body an opaque and non-reflective body it has a specific spectrum and intensity that depends only on the bodys temperature which is assumed for the sake of calculations and theory to be uniform and constant
the thermal radiation spontaneously emitted by many ordinary objects can be approximated as black-body radiation a perfectly insulated enclosure that is in thermal equilibrium internally contains black-body radiation and will emit it through a hole made in its wall provided the hole is small enough to have negligible effect upon the equilibrium
a black-body at room temperature appears black as most of the energy it radiates is infra-red and cannot be perceived by the human eye because the human eye cannot perceive colour at very low light intensities a black body viewed in the dark at the lowest just faintly visible temperature subjectively appears grey but only because the human eye is sensitive only to black and white at very low intensities – in reality the frequency of the light in the visible range would still be red although the intensity would be too low to discern as red even though its objective physical spectrum peaks in the infrared range when it becomes a little hotter it appears dull red as its temperature increases further it eventually becomes blue-white
although planets and stars are neither in thermal equilibrium with their surroundings nor perfect black bodies black-body radiation is used as a first approximation for the energy they emit black holes are near-perfect black bodies in the sense that they absorb all the radiation that falls on them it has been proposed that they emit black-body radiation called hawking radiation with a temperature that depends on the mass of the black hole
the term black body was introduced by gustav kirchhoff in 1860 black-body radiation is also called thermal radiation cavity radiation complete radiation or temperature radiation


 spectrum 
black-body radiation has a characteristic continuous frequency spectrum that depends only on the bodys temperature called the planck spectrum or plancks law the spectrum is peaked at a characteristic frequency that shifts to higher frequencies with increasing temperature and at room temperature most of the emission is in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum as the temperature increases past about 500 degrees celsius black bodies start to emit significant amounts of visible light viewed in the dark by the human eye the first faint glow appears as a ghostly grey the visible light is actually red but low intensity light activates only the eyes grey-level sensors with rising temperature the glow becomes visible even when there is some background surrounding light first as a dull red then yellow and eventually a dazzling bluish-white as the temperature rises when the body appears white it is emitting a substantial fraction of its energy as ultraviolet radiation the sun with an effective temperature of approximately 5800 k is an approximate black body with an emission spectrum peaked in the central yellow-green part of the visible spectrum but with significant power in the ultraviolet as well
black-body radiation provides insight into the thermodynamic equilibrium state of cavity radiation if each fourier mode of the equilibrium radiation in an otherwise empty cavity with perfectly reflective walls is considered as a degree of freedom capable of exchanging energy then according to the equipartition theorem of classical physics there would be an equal amount of energy in each mode since there are an infinite number of modes this implies infinite heat capacity infinite energy at any non-zero temperature as well as an unphysical spectrum of emitted radiation that grows without bound with increasing frequency a problem known as the ultraviolet catastrophe instead in quantum theory the occupation numbers of the modes are quantized cutting off the spectrum at high frequency in agreement with experimental observation and resolving the catastrophe the study of the laws of black bodies and the failure of classical physics to describe them helped establish the foundations of quantum mechanics


 explanation 

all normal baryonic matter emits electromagnetic radiation when it has a temperature above absolute zero the radiation represents a conversion of a bodys thermal energy into electromagnetic energy and is therefore called thermal radiation it is a spontaneous process of radiative distribution of entropy
conversely all normal matter absorbs electromagnetic radiation to some degree an object that absorbs all radiation falling on it at all wavelengths is called a black body when a black body is at a uniform temperature its emission has a characteristic frequency distribution that depends on the temperature its emission is called black-body radiation
the concept of the black body is an idealization as perfect black bodies do not exist in nature graphite and lamp black with emissivities greater than 0.95 however are good approximations to a black material experimentally black-body radiation may be established best as the ultimately stable steady state equilibrium radiation in a cavity in a rigid body at a uniform temperature that is entirely opaque and is only partly reflective a closed box of graphite walls at a constant temperature with a small hole on one side produces a good approximation to ideal black-body radiation emanating from the opening
black-body radiation has the unique absolutely stable distribution of radiative intensity that can persist in thermodynamic equilibrium in a cavity in equilibrium for each frequency the total intensity of radiation that is emitted and reflected from a body that is the net amount of radiation leaving its surface called the spectral radiance is determined solely by the equilibrium temperature and does not depend upon the shape material or structure of the body for a black body a perfect absorber there is no reflected radiation and so the spectral radiance is due entirely to emission in addition a black body is a diffuse emitter its emission is independent of direction consequently black-body radiation may be viewed as the radiation from a black body at thermal equilibrium
black-body radiation becomes a visible glow of light if the temperature of the object is high enough the draper point is the temperature at which all solids glow a dim red about 798 k at 1000 k a small opening in the wall of a large uniformly heated opaque-walled cavity let us call it an oven viewed from outside looks red at 6000 k it looks white no matter how the oven is constructed or of what material as long as it is built so that almost all light entering is absorbed by its walls it will contain a good approximation to black-body radiation the spectrum and therefore color of the light that comes out will be a function of the cavity temperature alone a graph of the amount of energy inside the oven per unit volume and per unit frequency interval plotted versus frequency is called the black-body curve different curves are obtained by varying the temperature

two bodies that are at the same temperature stay in mutual thermal equilibrium so a body at temperature t surrounded by a cloud of light at temperature t on average will emit as much light into the cloud as it absorbs following prevosts exchange principle which refers to radiative equilibrium the principle of detailed balance says that in thermodynamic equilibrium every elementary process works equally in its forward and backward sense prevost also showed that the emission from a body is logically determined solely by its own internal state the causal effect of thermodynamic absorption on thermodynamic spontaneous emission is not direct but is only indirect as it affects the internal state of the body this means that at thermodynamic equilibrium the amount of every wavelength in every direction of thermal radiation emitted by a body at temperature t black or not is equal to the corresponding amount that the body absorbs because it is surrounded by light at temperature t
when the body is black the absorption is obvious the amount of light absorbed is all the light that hits the surface for a black body much bigger than the wavelength the light energy absorbed at any wavelength λ per unit time is strictly proportional to the black-body curve this means that the black-body curve is the amount of light energy emitted by a black body which justifies the name this is the condition for the applicability of kirchhoffs law of thermal radiation the black-body curve is characteristic of thermal light which depends only on the temperature of the walls of the cavity provided that the walls of the cavity are completely opaque and are not very reflective and that the cavity is in thermodynamic equilibrium when the black body is small so that its size is comparable to the wavelength of light the absorption is modified because a small object is not an efficient absorber of light of long wavelength but the principle of strict equality of emission and absorption is always upheld in a condition of thermodynamic equilibrium
in the laboratory black-body radiation is approximated by the radiation from a small hole in a large cavity a hohlraum in an entirely opaque body that is only partly reflective that is maintained at a constant temperature this technique leads to the alternative term cavity radiation any light entering the hole would have to reflect off the walls of the cavity multiple times before it escaped in which process it is nearly certain to be absorbed absorption occurs regardless of the wavelength of the radiation entering as long as it is small compared to the hole the hole then is a close approximation of a theoretical black body and if the cavity is heated the spectrum of the holes radiation ie the amount of light emitted from the hole at each wavelength will be continuous and will depend only on the temperature and the fact that the walls are opaque and at least partly absorptive but not on the particular material of which they are built nor on the material in the cavity compare with emission spectrum
calculating the black-body curve was a major challenge in theoretical physics during the late nineteenth century the problem was solved in 1901 by max planck in the formalism now known as plancks law of black-body radiation by making changes to wiens radiation law not to be confused with wiens displacement law consistent with thermodynamics and electromagnetism he found a mathematical expression fitting the experimental data satisfactorily planck had to assume that the energy of the oscillators in the cavity was quantized ie it existed in integer multiples of some quantity einstein built on this idea and proposed the quantization of electromagnetic radiation itself in 1905 to explain the photoelectric effect these theoretical advances eventually resulted in the superseding of classical electromagnetism by quantum electrodynamics these quanta were called photons and the black-body cavity was thought of as containing a gas of photons in addition it led to the development of quantum probability distributions called fermi–dirac statistics and bose–einstein statistics each applicable to a different class of particles fermions and bosons
the wavelength at which the radiation is strongest is given by wiens displacement law and the overall power emitted per unit area is given by the stefan–boltzmann law so as temperature increases the glow color changes from red to yellow to white to blue even as the peak wavelength moves into the ultra-violet enough radiation continues to be emitted in the blue wavelengths that the body will continue to appear blue it will never become invisible—indeed the radiation of visible light increases monotonically with temperature the stefan–boltzmann law also says that the total radiant heat energy emitted from a surface is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature the law was formulated by josef stefan in 1879 and later derived by ludwig boltzmann the formula e  σt4 is given where e is the radiant heat emitted from a unit of area per unit time t is the absolute temperature and σ  5.670367×10−8 w·m−2⋅k−4 is the stefan–boltzmann constant 
the radiance or observed intensity is not a function of direction therefore a black body is a perfect lambertian radiator
real objects never behave as full-ideal black bodies and instead the emitted radiation at a given frequency is a fraction of what the ideal emission would be the emissivity of a material specifies how well a real body radiates energy as compared with a black body this emissivity depends on factors such as temperature emission angle and wavelength however it is typical in engineering to assume that a surfaces spectral emissivity and absorptivity do not depend on wavelength so that the emissivity is a constant this is known as the gray body assumption

with non-black surfaces the deviations from ideal black-body behavior are determined by both the surface structure such as roughness or granularity and the chemical composition on a per wavelength basis real objects in states of local thermodynamic equilibrium still follow kirchhoffs law emissivity equals absorptivity so that an object that does not absorb all incident light will also emit less radiation than an ideal black body the incomplete absorption can be due to some of the incident light being transmitted through the body or to some of it being reflected at the surface of the body
in astronomy objects such as stars are frequently regarded as black bodies though this is often a poor approximation an almost perfect black-body spectrum is exhibited by the cosmic microwave background radiation hawking radiation is the hypothetical black-body radiation emitted by black holes at a temperature that depends on the mass charge and spin of the hole if this prediction is correct black holes will very gradually shrink and evaporate over time as they lose mass by the emission of photons and other particles
a black body radiates energy at all frequencies but its intensity rapidly tends to zero at high frequencies short wavelengths for example a black body at room temperature 300 k with one square meter of surface area will emit a photon in the visible range 390–750 nm at an average rate of one photon every 41 seconds meaning that for most practical purposes such a black body does not emit in the visible range

 wiens displacement law

the total energy radiated in one day is about 8 mj or 2000 kcal food calories basal metabolic rate for a 40-year-old male is about 35 kcalm2·h which is equivalent to 1700 kcal per day assuming the same 2 m2 area however the mean metabolic rate of sedentary adults is about 50% to 70% greater than their basal rate
there are other important thermal loss mechanisms including convection and evaporation conduction is negligible – the nusselt number is much greater than unity evaporation by perspiration is only required if radiation and convection are insufficient to maintain a steady-state temperature but evaporation from the lungs occurs regardless free-convection rates are comparable albeit somewhat lower than radiative rates thus radiation accounts for about two-thirds of thermal energy loss in cool still air given the approximate nature of many of the assumptions this can only be taken as a crude estimate ambient air motion causing forced convection or evaporation reduces the relative importance of radiation as a thermal-loss mechanism

 temperature relation between a planet and its star 

the black-body law may be used to estimate the temperature of a planet orbiting the sun

the temperature of a planet depends on several factors
incident radiation from its star
emitted radiation of the planet eg earths infrared glow
the albedo effect causing a fraction of light to be reflected by the planet
the greenhouse effect for planets with an atmosphere
energy generated internally by a planet itself due to radioactive decay tidal heating and adiabatic contraction due by cooling
the analysis only considers the suns heat for a planet in a solar system
the stefan–boltzmann law gives the total power energysecond the sun is emitting

this is the temperature of the earth if it radiated as a perfect black body in the infrared assuming an unchanging albedo and ignoring greenhouse effects which can raise the surface temperature of a body above what it would be if it were a perfect black body in all spectrums the earth in fact radiates not quite as a perfect black body in the infrared which will raise the estimated temperature a few degrees above the effective temperature if we wish to estimate what the temperature of the earth would be if it had no atmosphere then we could take the albedo and emissivity of the moon as a good estimate the albedo and emissivity of the moon are about 0.1054 and 0.95 respectively yielding an estimated temperature of about 1.36 °c
estimates of the earths average albedo vary in the range 0.3–0.4 resulting in different estimated effective temperatures estimates are often based on the solar constant total insolation power density rather than the temperature size and distance of the sun for example using 0.4 for albedo and an insolation of 1400 w m−2 one obtains an effective temperature of about 245 k similarly using albedo 0.3 and solar constant of 1372 w m−2 one obtains an effective temperature of 255 k


 cosmology 
the cosmic microwave background radiation observed today is the most perfect black-body radiation ever observed in nature with a temperature of about 2.7 k it is a snapshot of the radiation at the time of decoupling between matter and radiation in the early universe prior to this time most matter in the universe was in the form of an ionized plasma in thermal though not full thermodynamic equilibrium with radiation
according to kondepudi and prigogine at very high temperatures above 1010 k such temperatures existed in the very early universe where the thermal motion separates protons and neutrons in spite of the strong nuclear forces electron-positron pairs appear and disappear spontaneously and are in thermal equilibrium with electromagnetic radiation these particles form a part of the black body spectrum in addition to the electromagnetic radiation

where v is the velocity of the source in the observers rest frame θ is the angle between the velocity vector and the observer-source direction measured in the reference frame of the source and c is the speed of light this can be simplified for the special cases of objects moving directly towards θ  π or away θ  0 from the observer and for speeds much less than c
through plancks law the temperature spectrum of a black body is proportionally related to the frequency of light and one may substitute the temperature t for the frequency in this equation

 history 


 balfour stewart 
in 1858 balfour stewart described his experiments on the thermal radiative emissive and absorptive powers of polished plates of various substances compared with the powers of lamp-black surfaces at the same temperature stewart chose lamp-black surfaces as his reference because of various previous experimental findings especially those of pierre prevost and of john leslie he wrote lamp-black which absorbs all the rays that fall upon it and therefore possesses the greatest possible absorbing power will possess also the greatest possible radiating power more an experimenter than a logician stewart failed to point out that his statement presupposed an abstract general principle that there exist either ideally in theory or really in nature bodies or surfaces that respectively have one and the same unique universal greatest possible absorbing power likewise for radiating power for every wavelength and equilibrium temperature
stewart measured radiated power with a thermo-pile and sensitive galvanometer read with a microscope he was concerned with selective thermal radiation which he investigated with plates of substances that radiated and absorbed selectively for different qualities of radiation rather than maximally for all qualities of radiation he discussed the experiments in terms of rays which could be reflected and refracted and which obeyed the stokes-helmholtz reciprocity principle though he did not use an eponym for it he did not in this paper mention that the qualities of the rays might be described by their wavelengths nor did he use spectrally resolving apparatus such as prisms or diffraction gratings his work was quantitative within these constraints he made his measurements in a room temperature environment and quickly so as to catch his bodies in a condition near the thermal equilibrium in which they had been prepared by heating to equilibrium with boiling water his measurements confirmed that substances that emit and absorb selectively respect the principle of selective equality of emission and absorption at thermal equilibrium
stewart offered a theoretical proof that this should be the case separately for every selected quality of thermal radiation but his mathematics was not rigorously valid he made no mention of thermodynamics in this paper though he did refer to conservation of vis viva he proposed that his measurements implied that radiation was both absorbed and emitted by particles of matter throughout depths of the media in which it propagated he applied the helmholtz reciprocity principle to account for the material interface processes as distinct from the processes in the interior material he did not postulate unrealizable perfectly black surfaces he concluded that his experiments showed that in a cavity in thermal equilibrium the heat radiated from any part of the interior bounding surface no matter of what material it might be composed was the same as would have been emitted from a surface of the same shape and position that would have been composed of lamp-black he did not state explicitly that the lamp-black-coated bodies that he used as reference must have had a unique common spectral emittance function that depended on temperature in a unique way


 gustav kirchhoff 
in 1859 not knowing of stewarts work gustav robert kirchhoff reported the coincidence of the wavelengths of spectrally resolved lines of absorption and of emission of visible light importantly for thermal physics he also observed that bright lines or dark lines were apparent depending on the temperature difference between emitter and absorber
kirchhoff then went on to consider bodies that emit and absorb heat radiation in an opaque enclosure or cavity in equilibrium at temperature t
here is used a notation different from kirchhoffs here the emitting power et i denotes a dimensioned quantity the total radiation emitted by a body labeled by index i at temperature t the total absorption ratio at i of that body is dimensionless the ratio of absorbed to incident radiation in the cavity at temperature t  in contrast with balfour stewarts kirchhoffs definition of his absorption ratio did not refer in particular to a lamp-black surface as the source of the incident radiation thus the ratio et i  at i of emitting power to absorption ratio is a dimensioned quantity with the dimensions of emitting power because at i is dimensionless also here the wavelength-specific emitting power of the body at temperature t is denoted by eλ t i and the wavelength-specific absorption ratio by aλ t i  again the ratio eλ t i  aλ t i of emitting power to absorption ratio is a dimensioned quantity with the dimensions of emitting power
in a second report made in 1859 kirchhoff announced a new general principle or law for which he offered a theoretical and mathematical proof though he did not offer quantitative measurements of radiation powers his theoretical proof was and still is considered by some writers to be invalid his principle however has endured it was that for heat rays of the same wavelength in equilibrium at a given temperature the wavelength-specific ratio of emitting power to absorption ratio has one and the same common value for all bodies that emit and absorb at that wavelength in symbols the law stated that the wavelength-specific ratio eλ t i  aλ t i has one and the same value for all bodies that is for all values of index i  in this report there was no mention of black bodies
in 1860 still not knowing of stewarts measurements for selected qualities of radiation kirchhoff pointed out that it was long established experimentally that for total heat radiation of unselected quality emitted and absorbed by a body in equilibrium the dimensioned total radiation ratio et i  at i has one and the same value common to all bodies that is for every value of the material index i again without measurements of radiative powers or other new experimental data kirchhoff then offered a fresh theoretical proof of his new principle of the universality of the value of the wavelength-specific ratio eλ t i  aλ t i at thermal equilibrium his fresh theoretical proof was and still is considered by some writers to be invalid
but more importantly it relied on a new theoretical postulate of perfectly black bodies which is the reason why one speaks of kirchhoffs law such black bodies showed complete absorption in their infinitely thin most superficial surface they correspond to balfour stewarts reference bodies with internal radiation coated with lamp-black they were not the more realistic perfectly black bodies later considered by planck plancks black bodies radiated and absorbed only by the material in their interiors their interfaces with contiguous media were only mathematical surfaces capable neither of absorption nor emission but only of reflecting and transmitting with refraction
kirchhoffs proof considered an arbitrary non-ideal body labeled i as well as various perfect black bodies labeled bb  it required that the bodies be kept in a cavity in thermal equilibrium at temperature t  his proof intended to show that the ratio eλ t i  aλ t i was independent of the nature i of the non-ideal body however partly transparent or partly reflective it was
his proof first argued that for wavelength λ and at temperature t at thermal equilibrium all perfectly black bodies of the same size and shape have the one and the same common value of emissive power eλ t bb with the dimensions of power his proof noted that the dimensionless wavelength-specific absorption ratio aλ t bb of a perfectly black body is by definition exactly 1 then for a perfectly black body the wavelength-specific ratio of emissive power to absorption ratio eλ t bb  aλ t bb is again just eλ t bb with the dimensions of power kirchhoff considered successively thermal equilibrium with the arbitrary non-ideal body and with a perfectly black body of the same size and shape in place in his cavity in equilibrium at temperature t  he argued that the flows of heat radiation must be the same in each case thus he argued that at thermal equilibrium the ratio eλ t i  aλ t i was equal to eλ t bb which may now be denoted bλ λ t a continuous function dependent only on λ at fixed temperature t and an increasing function of t at fixed wavelength λ at low temperatures vanishing for visible but not for longer wavelengths with positive values for visible wavelengths at higher temperatures which does not depend on the nature i of the arbitrary non-ideal body geometrical factors taken into detailed account by kirchhoff have been ignored in the foregoing
thus kirchhoffs law of thermal radiation can be stated for any material at all radiating and absorbing in thermodynamic equilibrium at any given temperature t for every wavelength λ the ratio of emissive power to absorptive ratio has one universal value which is characteristic of a perfect black body and is an emissive power which we here represent by bλ λ t  for our notation bλ λ t kirchhoffs original notation was simply e
kirchhoff announced that the determination of the function bλ λ t was a problem of the highest importance though he recognized that there would be experimental difficulties to be overcome he supposed that like other functions that do not depend on the properties of individual bodies it would be a simple function occasionally by historians that function bλ λ t has been called kirchhoffs emission universal function though its precise mathematical form would not be known for another forty years till it was discovered by planck in 1900 the theoretical proof for kirchhoffs universality principle was worked on and debated by various physicists over the same time and later kirchhoff stated later in 1860 that his theoretical proof was better than balfour stewarts and in some respects it was so kirchhoffs 1860 paper did not mention the second law of thermodynamics and of course did not mention the concept of entropy which had not at that time been established in a more considered account in a book in 1862 kirchhoff mentioned the connection of his law with carnots principle which is a form of the second law
according to helge kragh quantum theory owes its origin to the study of thermal radiation in particular to the black-body radiation that robert kirchhoff had first defined in 1859–1860
