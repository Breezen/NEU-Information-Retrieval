the brain of physicist albert einstein has been a subject of much research and speculation einsteins brain was removed within seven and a half hours of his death the brain has attracted attention because of einsteins reputation as one of the foremost geniuses of the 20th century and apparent regularities or irregularities in the brain have been used to support various ideas about correlations in neuroanatomy with general or mathematical intelligence scientific studies have suggested that regions involved in speech and language are smaller while regions involved with numerical and spatial processing are larger other studies have suggested an increased number of glial cells in einsteins brain


 fate of the brain 
einsteins autopsy was conducted in a lab at princeton hospital by pathologist thomas stoltz harvey shortly after einsteins death in 1955 harvey removed and weighed the brain at 1230g harvey then took the brain to a lab at the university of pennsylvania where he dissected it into several pieces some of the pieces he kept to himself while others were given to leading pathologists he claimed he hoped that cytoarchitectonics would reveal useful information harvey injected 50% formalin through the internal carotid arteries and afterward suspended the intact brain in 10% formalin harvey photographed the brain from many angles he then dissected it into about 240 blocks each about 1 cm3 and encased the segments in a plastic-like material called collodion harvey also removed einsteins eyes and gave them to henry abrams einsteins ophthalmologist whether or not einsteins brain was preserved with his prior consent is a matter of dispute ronald clarks 1979 biography of einstein states he had insisted that his brain should be used for research and that he be cremated but more recent research has suggested that this may not be true and that the brain was removed and preserved without the permission of either einstein or his close relatives hans albert einstein the physicists elder son endorsed the removal after the event but insisted that his fathers brain should be used only for research to be published in scientific journals of high standing
in 1978 einsteins brain was rediscovered in harveys possession by journalist steven levy its sections had been preserved in alcohol in two large mason jars within a cider box for over 20 years in 2010 harveys heirs transferred all of his holdings constituting the remains of einsteins brain to the national museum of health and medicine including 14 photographs of the whole brain which was now in fragments never before revealed to the public
more recently 46 small portions of einsteins brain were acquired by the mütter museum in philadelphia in 2013 these thin slices mounted on microscope slides went on exhibit in the museums permanent galleries


 scientific studies 


 autopsy 
harvey had reported that einstein had no parietal operculum in either hemisphere but this finding has been disputed photographs of the brain show an enlarged sylvian fissure in 1999 further analysis by a team at mcmaster university in hamilton ontario revealed that his parietal operculum region in the inferior frontal gyrus in the frontal lobe of the brain was vacant also absent was part of a bordering region called the lateral sulcus sylvian fissure researchers at mcmaster university speculated that the vacancy may have enabled neurons in this part of his brain to communicate better this unusual brain anatomymissing part of the sylvian fissure may explain why einstein thought the way he did said professor sandra witelson who led the research published in the lancet this study was based on photographs of the whole brain made at autopsy in 1955 by harvey and not a direct examination of the brain einstein himself claimed that he thought visually rather than verbally professor laurie hall of cambridge university commenting on the study said to say there is a definite link is one bridge too far at the moment so far the case isnt proven but magnetic resonance and other new technologies are allowing us to start to probe those very questions


 glial cells 
in the 1980s university of california berkeley professor marian diamond received four sections of the cortical association regions of the superior prefrontal and inferior parietal lobes in the right and left hemispheres of albert einsteins brain from thomas harvey in 1984 marian diamond and her associates were the first ever to publish research on the brain of albert einstein she compared the ratio of glial cells in einsteins brain with that of the preserved brains of 11 other males glial cells provide support and nutrition in the brain form myelin and participate in signal transmission and are the other integral component of the brain besides the neurons dr diamonds laboratory made thin sections of einsteins brain each 6 micrometers thick they then used a microscope to count the cells einsteins brain had more glial cells relative to neurons in all areas studied but only in the left inferior parietal area was the difference statistically significant this area is part of the association cortex regions of the brain responsible for incorporating and synthesizing information from multiple other brain regions a stimulating environment can increase the proportion of glial cells and the high ratio could possibly result from einsteins life studying stimulating scientific problems  the limitation that diamond admits in her study is that she had only one einstein to compare with 11 brains of normal intelligence individuals s s kantha of the osaka bioscience institute criticized diamonds study as did terence hines of pace university other issues related to diamonds study point out glial cells continue dividing as a person ages and although einsteins brain was 76 it was compared to brains that averaged 64 in age eleven male brains 47–80 years of age diamond in her landmark study on the brain of a scientist albert einstein noted that the 11 male individuals whose brains were used in her control base had died from nonneurologically related diseases she also noted that chronological age is not necessarily a useful indicator in measuring biological systems environmental factors also play a strong role in modifying the conditions of the organism one major problem in dealing with human specimens is that they do not come from controlled environments additionally there is little information regarding the samples of brains that einsteins brain was compared against such as iq score or other relevant factors diamond also admitted that research disproving the study was omitted his brain is now at the mütter museum in philadelphia and two of the 140 sections are on loan at the british museum
scientists are currently interested in the possibility that physical differences in brain structure could determine different abilities one part of the operculum called brocas area plays an important role in speech production to compensate the inferior parietal lobe was 15 percent wider than normal the inferior parietal region is responsible for mathematical thought visuospatial cognition and imagery of movement


 hippocampus 
dr dahlia zaidel of the university of california los angeles examined two slices of albert einsteins brain containing the hippocampus in 2001 the hippocampus is a subcortical brain structure that plays an important role in learning and memory the neurons on the left side of the hippocampus were found to be significantly larger than those on the right and when compared with normal brain slices of the same area in ordinary people there was only minimal inconsistent asymmetry in this area the larger neurons in the left hippocampus zaidel noted imply that einsteins left brain may have had stronger nerve cell connections between the hippocampus and another part of the brain called the neocortex than his right the neocortex is where detailed logical analytical and innovative thinking takes place zaidel noted in a prepared statement 


 stronger connection between brain hemispheres 
a study published in the journal brain in september 2013 analyzed einsteins corpus callosum - a large bundle of fibers that connects the two cerebral hemispheres and facilitates interhemispheric communication in the brain - using a novel technique that allowed for a higher resolution measurement of the fiber thickness einsteins corpus callosum was compared to two sample groups 15 brains of elderly people and 52 brains from people aged 26 einstein was 26 in 1905 his annus mirabilis miracle year the findings show that einstein had more extensive connections between certain parts of his cerebral hemispheres compared to both younger and older control group brains


 newly recovered photographs 
a study the cerebral cortex of albert einstein a description and preliminary analysis of unpublished photographs was published on november 16 2012 in the journal brain dean falk an evolutionary anthropologist at florida state university led the study - which analyzed 14 recently discovered photographs - and described the brain although the overall size and asymmetrical shape of einsteins brain were normal the prefrontal somatosensory primary motor parietal temporal and occipital cortices were extraordinary there was a fourth ridge apart from the three normal people have in einsteins mid-frontal lobe involved in making plans and working memory the parietal lobes were markedly asymmetrical and a feature in einsteins primary motor cortex may have been associated with his musical ability
another study led by shanghai-based east china normal universitys department of physics the corpus callosum of albert einsteins brain another clue to his high intelligence published in the journal brain on september 24 2013 showed a new technique to conduct the study which is the first to detail einsteins corpus callosum the brains largest bundle of fibers that connects the two cerebral hemispheres and facilitates interhemispheric communication einsteins corpus callosum was thicker than those in control groups possibly indicating better cooperation between the hemispheres scientists currently cannot tell how far the unusual features above were innate or how far they were due to einstein devoting his life to higher thought


 criticism 
selection bias may have influenced published results which means that results showing differences between einsteins brain and other brains tend to get published while results showing that in many respects einsteins brain was like other brains tend to be neglected researchers knew which brain was einsteins and which were controls allowing possible conscious or unconscious bias and preventing impartial research
by contrast neurologist terence hines of pace university is strongly critical of the studies and has stated that they are flawed hines maintains that all human brains are unique and different from others in some ways therefore assuming unique features in einsteins brain were connected with his genius in hines opinion goes beyond the evidence he argues further that correlating unusual brain features with any characteristic requires studying many brains with those features and says that scanning the brains of many very capable scientists would be better research than investigating the brains of just one or two geniuses


 brains of other geniuses 
preserving the brains of geniuses was not a new phenomenon—another brain to be preserved and discussed in a similar manner was that of the german mathematician carl friedrich gauss almost a hundred years earlier his brain was studied by rudolf wagner who found its weight to be 1,492 grams and the cerebral area equal to 219,588 square millimeters also found were highly developed convolutions which was suggested as the explanation of his genius other brains that were removed and studied include those of vladimir lenin the mathematician sofia kovalevskaya and the native american ishi the brain of edward h rulloff a noted philologist and criminal was removed after his death in 1871 in 1972 it was still the second largest brain on record
