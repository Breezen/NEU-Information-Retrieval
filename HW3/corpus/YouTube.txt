karim said the inspiration for youtube first came from janet jacksons role in the 2004 super bowl incident when her breast was exposed during her performance and later from the 2004 indian ocean tsunami karim could not easily find video clips of either event online which led to the idea of a video sharing site hurley and chen said that the original idea for youtube was a video version of an online dating service and had been influenced by the website hot or not

 social impact 

both private individuals and large production companies have used youtube to grow audiences independent content creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic concurrently old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a youtube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television while youtubes revenue-sharing partner program made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer—its top five hundred partners each earning more than 100,000 annually and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from 2.5 million to 12 million—in 2012 cmu business editor characterized youtube as a free-to-use promotional platform for the music labels in 2013 forbes katheryn thayer asserted that digital-era artists work must not only be of high quality but must elicit reactions on the youtube platform and social media videos of the 2.5% of artists categorized as mega mainstream and mid-sized received 90.3% of the relevant views on youtube and vevo in that year by early 2013 billboard had announced that it was factoring youtube streaming data into calculation of the billboard hot 100 and related genre charts

during the same court battle viacom won a court ruling requiring youtube to hand over 12 terabytes of data detailing the viewing habits of every user who has watched videos on the site the decision was criticized by the electronic frontier foundation which called the court ruling a setback to privacy rights in june 2010 viacoms lawsuit against google was rejected in a summary judgment with us federal judge louis l stanton stating that google was protected by provisions of the digital millennium copyright act viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling on april 5 2012 the united states court of appeals for the second circuit reinstated the case allowing viacoms lawsuit against google to be heard in court again on march 18 2014 the lawsuit was settled after seven years with an undisclosed agreement
in august 2008 a us court ruled in lenz v universal music corp that copyright holders cannot order the removal of an online file without first determining whether the posting reflected fair use of the material the case involved stephanie lenz from gallitzin pennsylvania who had made a home video of her 13-month-old son dancing to princes song lets go crazy and posted the 29-second video on youtube in the case of smith v summit entertainment llc professional singer matt smith sued summit entertainment for the wrongful use of copyright takedown notices on youtube he asserted seven causes of action and four were ruled in smiths favor
in april 2012 a court in hamburg ruled that youtube could be held responsible for copyrighted material posted by its users the performance rights organization gema argued that youtube had not done enough to prevent the uploading of german copyrighted music youtube responded by stating
on november 1 2016 the dispute with gema was resolved with google content id being used to allow advertisements to be added to videos with content protected by gema
in april 2013 it was reported that universal music group and youtube have a contractual agreement that prevents content blocked on youtube by a request from umg from being restored even if the uploader of the video files a dmca counter-notice when a dispute occurs the uploader of the video has to contact umg youtubes owner google announced in november 2015 that they would help cover the legal cost in select cases where they believe fair use laws apply


 content id 

in june 2007 youtube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright google ceo eric schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from viacom which alleged that youtube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute the system which became known as content id creates an id file for copyrighted audio and video material and stores it in a database when a video is uploaded it is checked against the database and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found when this occurs the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable tracking the viewing statistics of the video or adding advertisements to the video youtube describes content id as very accurate in finding uploads that look similar to reference files that are of sufficient length and quality to generate an effective id file content id accounts for over a third of the monetized views on youtube
an independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to youtube and concluded that while the system was surprisingly resilient in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos it was not infallible the use of content id to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use if a youtube user disagrees with a decision by content id it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision prior to 2016 videos werent monetized until the dispute was resolved since april 2016 videos continue to be monetized while the dispute is in progress and the money goes to whoever won the dispute should the uploader want to monetize the video again they may remove the disputed audio in the video manager youtube has cited the effectiveness of content id as one of the reasons why the sites rules were modified in december 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length


 controversial content 

youtube has also faced criticism over the handling of offensive content in some of its videos the uploading of videos containing defamation pornography and material encouraging criminal conduct is forbidden by youtubes community guidelines youtube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate and a youtube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the sites guidelines
controversial content has included material relating to holocaust denial and the hillsborough disaster in which 96 football fans from liverpool were crushed to death in 1989 in july 2008 the culture and media committee of the house of commons of the united kingdom stated that it was unimpressed with youtubes system for policing its videos and argued that proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated content youtube responded by stating

we have strict rules on whats allowed and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our 24/7 review team and have it dealt with promptly we educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every youtube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users given the volume of content uploaded on our site we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly july 2008

in october 2010 us congressman anthony weiner urged youtube to remove from its website videos of imam anwar al-awlaki youtube pulled some of the videos in november 2010 stating they violated the sites guidelines in december 2010 youtube added the ability to flag videos for containing terrorism content
following media reports about prism nsas massive electronic surveillance program in june 2013 several technology companies were identified as participants including youtube according to leaks of said program youtube joined the prism program in 2010
youtubes policies on advertiser-friendly content restrict what may be incorporated into videos being monetized this includes strong violence language sexual content and controversial or sensitive subjects and events including subjects related to war political conflicts natural disasters and tragedies even if graphic imagery is not shown unless the content is usually newsworthy or comedic and the creators intent is to inform or entertain in september 2016 after introducing an enhanced notification system to inform users of these violations youtubes policies were criticized by prominent users including phillip defranco and vlogbrothers defranco argued that not being able to earn advertising revenue on such videos was censorship by a different name a youtube spokesperson stated that while the policy itself was not new the service had improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators
 in march 2017 the government of the united kingdom pulled its advertising campaigns from youtube after reports that its ads had appeared on videos containing extremism content the government demanded assurances that its advertising would be delivered in a safe and appropriate way the guardian newspaper as well as other major british and us brands similarly suspended their advertising on youtube in response to their advertising appearing near offensive content google stated that it had begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear in early-april 2017 the youtube channel h3h3productions presented evidence claiming that a wall street journal article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing johnny rebel music overlaid on a chief keef music video citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader the video was retracted after it was found that the ads had actually been triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video
on april 6 2017 youtube announced that in order to ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules it would change its practices to require that a channel undergo a policy compliance review and have at least 10,000 lifetime views before they may join the partner program


 child protection 

in 2017 youtube was associated with several controversies related to child safety during q2 the owners of popular channel daddyofive which featured themselves playing pranks on their children were accused of child abuse their videos were eventually deleted and two of their children were removed from their custody
later that year youtube came under criticism for showing inappropriate videos targeted at children and often featuring popular characters in violent sexual or otherwise disturbing situations many of which appeared on youtube kids and attracted millions of views the term elsagate was coined on the internet and then used by various news outlets to refer to this controversy on november 11 2017 youtube announced it was strengthening site security to protect children from unsuitable content later that month the company started to mass delete videos and channels that made improper use of family friendly characters as part as a broader concern regarding child safety on youtube the wave of deletions also targeted channels which showed children taking part in inappropriate or dangerous activities under the guidance of adults most notably the company removed toy freaks a channel with over 8.5 million subscribers that featured a father and his two daughters in odd and upsetting situations according to analytics specialist socialblade it earned up to £8.7 million annually prior to its deletion
also in november 2017 it was revealed in the media that many videos featuring children – often uploaded by the minors themselves and showing innocent content – were attracting comments from pedophiles and circulating on the dark web with predators finding the videos by typing in certain keywords in russian as a result of the controversy which added to the concern about elsagate several major advertisers whose ads had been running against such videos froze spending on youtube


 user comments 

most videos enable users to leave comments and these have attracted attention for the negative aspects of both their form and content in 2006 time praised web 2.0 for enabling community and collaboration on a scale never seen before and added that youtube harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom some of the comments on youtube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred the guardian in 2009 described users comments on youtube as

juvenile aggressive misspelled sexist homophobic swinging from raging at the contents of a video to providing a pointlessly detailed description followed by a lol youtube comments are a hotbed of infantile debate and unashamed ignorance – with the occasional burst of wit shining through

in september 2008 the daily telegraph commented that youtube was notorious for some of the most confrontational and ill-formed comment exchanges on the internet and reported on youtube comment snob a new piece of software that blocks rude and illiterate posts the huffington post noted in april 2012 that finding comments on youtube that appear offensive stupid and crass to the vast majority of the people is hardly difficult
on november 6 2013 google implemented a comment system oriented on google that required all youtube users to use a google account in order to comment on videos the stated motivation for the change was giving creators more power to moderate and block comments thereby addressing frequent criticisms of their quality and tone the new system restored the ability to include urls in comments which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse in response youtube co-founder jawed karim posted the question why the fuck do i need a google account to comment on a video on his youtube channel to express his negative opinion of the change the official youtube announcement received 20,097 thumbs down votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days writing in the newsday blog silicon island chase melvin noted that google is nowhere near as popular a social media network as facebook but its essentially being forced upon millions of youtube users who dont want to lose their ability to comment on videos and discussion forums across the internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system in the same article melvin goes on to say

perhaps user complaints are justified but the idea of revamping the old system isnt so bad
think of the crude misogynistic and racially-charged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on youtube without any discernible moderation isnt any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot the system is far from perfect but google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate youtubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity

on july 27 2015 google announced in a blog post that it would be removing the requirement to sign up to a google account to post comments to youtube
on november 3 2016 youtube announced a trial scheme which allows the creators of videos to decide whether to approve hide or report the comments posted on videos based on an algorithm that detects potentially offensive comments creators may also choose to keep or delete comments with links or hashtags in order to combat spam they can also allow other users to moderate their comments


 view counts 
in december 2012 two billion views were removed from the view counts of universal and sony music videos on youtube prompting a claim by the daily dot that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the sites terms of service which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts this was disputed by billboard which said that the two billion views had been moved to vevo since the videos were no longer active on youtube on august 5 2015 youtube removed the feature which caused a videos view count to freeze at 301 later 301 until the actual count was verified to prevent view count fraud youtube view counts once again updated in real time


 censorship and filtering 

as of 2017 countries with standing national bans on youtube are china and north korea while iran blocks youtube on only one internet service provider
youtube may be blocked for a variety of reasons including
limiting public exposure to content that may ignite social or political unrest
preventing criticism of a ruler eg in north korea government eg in china or its actions eg in morocco government officials eg in turkey and libya or religion eg in pakistan
violations of national laws including
copyright and intellectual property protection laws for example in germany
violations of hate speech ethics or morality-based laws eg in iran and

preventing access to videos judged to be inappropriate for youth which is also done by youtube with the youtube kids app and with restricted mode
reducing distractions at work or school eg in australia and
reducing the amount of network bandwidth used
in some countries youtube is completely blocked either through a long term standing ban or for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest the run-up to an election or in response to upcoming political anniversaries in other countries access to the website as a whole remains open but access to specific videos is blocked in cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video youtube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service businesses schools government agencies and other private institutions often block social media sites including youtube due to bandwidth limitations and the sites potential for distraction
several countries have previously blocked access to youtube
iran temporarily blocked access on december 3 2006 to youtube and several other sites after declaring them as violating social and moral codes of conduct the youtube block came after a video was posted online that appeared to show an iranian soap opera star having sex the block was later lifted and then reinstated after irans 2009 presidential election in 2012 iran reblocked access along with access to google after the controversial film innocence of muslims trailer was released on youtube
thailand blocked access between 2006 and 2007 due to offensive videos relating to king bhumibol adulyadej
some australian state education departments block youtube citing an inability to determine what sort of video material might be accessed and theres no educational value to it and the content of the material on the site
china blocked access from october 15 2007 to march 22 2008 and again starting on march 24 2009 access remains blocked
morocco blocked access in may 2007 possibly as a result of videos critical of moroccos actions in western sahara youtube became accessible again on may 30 2007 after maroc telecom unofficially announced that the denied access to the website was a mere technical glitch
turkey blocked access between 2008 and 2010 after controversy over videos deemed insulting to mustafa kemal atatürk in november 2010 a video of the turkish politician deniz baykal caused the site to be blocked again briefly and the site was threatened with a new shutdown if it did not remove the video during the two and a half-year block of youtube the video-sharing website remained the eighth-most-accessed site in turkey in 2014 turkey blocked the access for the second time after a high-level intelligence leak
pakistan blocked access on february 23 2008 because of offensive material towards the islamic faith including display of the danish cartoons of muhammad this led to a near global blackout of the youtube site for around two hours as the pakistani block was inadvertently transferred to other countries on february 26 2008 the ban was lifted after the website had removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government many pakistanis circumvented the three-day block by using virtual private network software in may 2010 following the everybody draw mohammed day pakistan again blocked access to youtube citing growing sacrilegious content the ban was lifted on may 27 2010 after the website removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government however individual videos deemed offensive to muslims posted on youtube will continue to be blocked pakistan again placed a ban on youtube in september 2012 after the site refused to remove the film innocence of muslims with the ban still in operation as of september 2013 the ban was lifted in january 2016 after youtube launched a pakistan-specific version
turkmenistan blocked access on december 25 2009 for unknown reasons other websites such as livejournal were also blocked
libya blocked access on january 24 2010 because of videos that featured demonstrations in the city of benghazi by families of detainees who were killed in abu salim prison in 1996 and videos of family members of libyan leader muammar gaddafi at parties the blocking was criticized by human rights watch in november 2011 after the libyan civil war youtube was once again allowed in libya
afghanistan bangladesh russia and sudan blocked access in september 2012 following controversy over a 14-minute trailer for the film innocence of muslims which had been posted on the site
in libya and egypt the innocence of muslims trailer was blamed for violent protests in september 2012 youtube stated that this video—which is widely available on the web—is clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on youtube however given the very difficult situation in libya and egypt we have temporarily restricted access in both countries
