a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes directly behind earth and into its shadow this can occur only when the sun earth and the moon are aligned in syzygy exactly or very closely so with the planet in between hence a lunar eclipse can occur only on the night of a full moon the type and length of an eclipse depend on the moons proximity to either node of its orbit
during a total lunar eclipse earth completely blocks direct sunlight from reaching the moon the only light reflected from the lunar surface has been refracted by earths atmosphere this light appears reddish for the same reason that a sunset or sunrise does the rayleigh scattering of bluer light due to this reddish color a totally eclipsed moon is sometimes called a blood moon
unlike a solar eclipse which can be viewed only from a certain relatively small area of the world a lunar eclipse may be viewed from anywhere on the night side of earth a total lunar eclipse lasts a few hours whereas a total solar eclipse lasts only a few minutes as viewed from any given place due to the smaller size of the moons shadow also unlike solar eclipses lunar eclipses are safe to view without any eye protection or special precautions as they are dimmer than the full moon
for the date of the next eclipse see the section recent and forthcoming lunar eclipses


 types of lunar eclipse 

earths shadow can be divided into two distinctive parts the umbra and penumbra earth totally occludes direct solar radiation within the umbra the central region of the shadow however since the suns diameter appears about one-quarter of earths in the lunar sky the planet only partially blocks direct sunlight within the penumbra the outer portion of the shadow
a penumbral lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through earths penumbra the penumbra causes a subtle dimming of the lunar surface a special type of penumbral eclipse is a total penumbral lunar eclipse during which the moon lies exclusively within earths penumbra total penumbral eclipses are rare and when these occur the portion of the moon closest to the umbra may appear slightly darker than the rest of the lunar disk
a partial lunar eclipse occurs when only a portion of the moon enters earths umbra while a total lunar eclipse occurs when the entire moon enters the planets umbra the moons average orbital speed is about 2,300 mph 1.03 kms or a little more than its diameter per hour so totality may last up to nearly 107 minutes nevertheless the total time between the first and the last contacts of the moons limb with earths shadow is much longer and could last up to four hours
the relative distance of the moon from earth at the time of an eclipse can affect the eclipses duration in particular when the moon is near apogeethe farthest point from earth in its orbit its orbital speed is the slowest the diameter of earths umbra does not decrease appreciably within the changes in the moons orbital distance thus the concurrence of a totally eclipsed moon near apogee will lengthen the duration of totality
a central lunar eclipse is a total lunar eclipse during which the moon passes through the centre of earths shadow contacting the antisolar point this type of lunar eclipse is relatively rare


 selenelion 

a selenelion or selenehelion occurs when both the sun and an eclipsed moon can be observed at the same time this can occur only just before sunset or just after sunrise when both bodies will appear just above the horizon at nearly opposite points in the sky this arrangement has led to the phenomenon being also called a horizontal eclipse
typically a number of high ridges undergoing sunrise or sunset can view it although the moon is in earths umbra both the sun and an eclipsed moon can be simultaneously seen because atmospheric refraction causes each body to appear higher in the sky than their true geometric positions


 timing 

the timing of total lunar eclipses are determined by its contacts
p1 first contact beginning of the penumbral eclipse earths penumbra touches the moons outer limb
u1 second contact beginning of the partial eclipse earths umbra touches the moons outer limb
u2 third contact beginning of the total eclipse the moons surface is entirely within earths umbra
greatest eclipse the peak stage of the total eclipse the moon is at its closest to the center of earths umbra
u3 fourth contact end of the total eclipse the moons outer limb exits earths umbra
u4 fifth contact end of the partial eclipse earths umbra leaves the moons surface
p4 sixth contact end of the penumbral eclipse earths penumbra no longer makes contact with the moon


 danjon scale 
the following scale the danjon scale was devised by andré danjon for rating the overall darkness of lunar eclipses
l0 very dark eclipse moon almost invisible especially at mid-totality
l1 dark eclipse gray or brownish in coloration details distinguishable only with difficulty
l2 deep red or rust-colored eclipse very dark central shadow while outer edge of umbra is relatively bright
l3 brick-red eclipse umbral shadow usually has a bright or yellow rim
l4 very bright copper-red or orange eclipse umbral shadow is bluish and has a very bright rim


 lunar versus solar eclipse 

there is often confusion between a solar and lunar eclipse while both involve interactions between the sun earth and moon they are very different in their interactions


 lunar eclipse appearance 

the moon does not completely disappear as it passes through the umbra because of the refraction of sunlight by the earths atmosphere into the shadow cone if the earth had no atmosphere the moon would be completely dark during an eclipse the reddish coloration arises because sunlight reaching the moon must pass through a long and dense layer of the earths atmosphere where it is scattered shorter wavelengths are more likely to be scattered by the air molecules and the small particles and so by the time the light has passed through the atmosphere the longer wavelengths dominate this resulting light we perceive as red this is the same effect that causes sunsets and sunrises to turn the sky a reddish color an alternative way of considering the problem is to realize that as viewed from the moon the sun would appear to be setting or rising behind the earth

the amount of refracted light depends on the amount of dust or clouds in the atmosphere this also controls how much light is scattered in general the dustier the atmosphere the more that other wavelengths of light will be removed compared to red light leaving the resulting light a deeper red color this causes the resulting coppery-red hue of the moon to vary from one eclipse to the next volcanoes are notable for expelling large quantities of dust into the atmosphere and a large eruption shortly before an eclipse can have a large effect on the resulting color


 lunar eclipse in culture 
several cultures have myths related to lunar eclipses or allude to the lunar eclipse as being a good or bad omen the egyptians saw the eclipse as a sow swallowing the moon for a short time other cultures view the eclipse as the moon being swallowed by other animals such as a jaguar in mayan tradition or a three legged toad in china some societies thought it was a demon swallowing the moon and that they could chase it away by throwing stones and curses at it the greeks were ahead of their time when they said the earth was round and used the shadow from the lunar eclipse as evidence some hindus believe in the importance of bathing in the ganges river following an eclipse because it will help to achieve salvation


 incans 
similarly to the mayans the incans believed that lunar eclipses occurred when a jaguar would eat the moon which is why a blood moon looks red the incans also believed that once the jaguar finished eating the moon it could come down and devour all the animals on earth so they would take spears and shout at the moon to keep it away


 mesopotamians 
the ancient mesopotamians believed that a lunar eclipse was when the moon was being attacked by seven demons this attack was more than just one on the moon however for the mesopotamians linked what happened in the sky with what happened on the land and because the king of mesopotamia represented the land the seven demons were thought to be also attacking the king in order to prevent this attack on the king the mesopotamians made someone pretend to be the king so they would be attacked instead of the true king after the lunar eclipse was over the substitute king was made to disappear possibly by poisoning


 chinese 
in some chinese cultures people would ring bells to prevent a dragon or other wild animals from biting the moon in the nineteenth century during a lunar eclipse the chinese navy fired its artillery because of this belief during the zhou dynasty in the book of songs the sight of a red moon engulfed in darkness was believed to foreshadow famine or disease


 blood moon 

certain lunar eclipses have been referred to as blood moons in popular articles but this is not a scientifically-recognized term this term has been given two separate but overlapping meanings
the first and simpler meaning relates to the reddish color a totally eclipsed moon takes on to observers on earth as sunlight penetrates the atmosphere of earth the gaseous layer filters and refracts the rays in such a way that the green to violet wavelengths on the visible spectrum scatter more strongly than the red thus giving the moon a reddish cast
the second meaning of blood moon has been derived from this apparent coloration by two fundamentalist christian pastors mark blitz and john hagee they claimed that the 2014–15 lunar tetrad of four lunar eclipses coinciding with the feasts of passover and tabernacles matched the moon turning to blood described in the book of joel of the hebrew bible this tetrad was claimed to herald the second coming of christ and the rapture as described in the book of revelations on the date of the first of the eclipses in this sequence on april 15 2014


 occurrence 

at least two lunar eclipses and as many as five occur every year although total lunar eclipses are significantly less common if the date and time of an eclipse is known the occurrences of upcoming eclipses are predictable using an eclipse cycle like the saros


 recent and forthcoming lunar eclipses 

eclipses occur only during an eclipse season when the sun appears to pass near either node of the moons orbit
