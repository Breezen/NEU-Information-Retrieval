causality also referred to as causation or cause and effect is the natural or worldly agency or efficacy that connects one process the cause with another process or state the effect where the first is partly responsible for the second and the second is partly dependent on the first in general a process has many causes which are said to be causal factors for it and all lie in its past an effect can in turn be a cause of or causal factor for many other effects which all lie in its future causality is metaphysically prior to notions of time and space
causality is an abstraction that indicates how the world progresses so basic a concept that it is more apt as an explanation of other concepts of progression than as something to be explained by others more basic the concept is like those of agency and efficacy for this reason a leap of intuition may be needed to grasp it accordingly causality is implicit in the logic and structure of ordinary language
aristotelian philosophy uses the word cause to mean explanation or answer to a why question including aristotles material formal efficient and final causes then the cause is the explanans for the explanandum in this case failure to recognize that different kinds of cause are being considered can lead to futile debate of aristotles four explanatory modes the one nearest to the concerns of the present article is the efficient one
the topic of causality remains a staple in contemporary philosophy


 concept 


 metaphysics 
the nature of cause and effect is a concern of the subject known as metaphysics


 ontology 
a general metaphysical question about cause and effect is what kind of entity can be a cause and what kind of entity can be an effect
one viewpoint on this question is that cause and effect are of one and the same kind of entity with causality an asymmetric relation between them that is to say it would make good sense grammatically to say either a is the cause and b the effect or b is the cause and a the effect though only one of those two can be actually true in this view one opinion proposed as a metaphysical principle in process philosophy is that every cause and every effect is respectively some process event becoming or happening an example is his tripping over the step was the cause and his breaking his ankle the effect another view is that causes and effects are states of affairs with the exact natures of those entities being less restrictively defined than in process philosophy
another viewpoint on the question is the more classical one that a cause and its effect can be of different kinds of entity for example in aristotles efficient causal explanation an action can be a cause while an enduring object is its effect for example the generative actions of his parents can be regarded as the efficient cause with socrates being the effect socrates being regarded as an enduring object in philosophical tradition called a substance as distinct from an action


 epistemology 
since causality is a subtle metaphysical notion considerable effort is needed to establish knowledge of it in particular empirical circumstances


 geometrical significance 
causality has the properties of antecedence and contiguity these are topological and are ingredients for space-time geometry as developed by alfred robb these properties allow the derivation of the notions of time and space max jammer writes the einstein postulate  opens the way to a straightforward construction of the causal topology  of minkowski space causal efficacy propagates no faster than light
thus the notion of causality is metaphysically prior to the notions of time and space in practical terms this is because use of the relation of causality is necessary for the interpretation of empirical experiments interpretation of experiments is needed to establish the physical and geometrical notions of time and space


 necessary and sufficient causes 

causes may sometimes be distinguished into two types necessary and sufficient a third type of causation which requires neither necessity nor sufficiency in and of itself but which contributes to the effect is called a contributory cause
necessary causes
if x is a necessary cause of y then the presence of y necessarily implies the prior occurrence of x the presence of x however does not imply that y will occur
sufficient causes
if x is a sufficient cause of y then the presence of x necessarily implies the subsequent occurrence of y however another cause z may alternatively cause y thus the presence of y does not imply the prior occurrence of x
contributory causes
for some specific effect in a singular case a factor that is a contributory cause is one amongst several co-occurrent causes it is implicit that all of them are contributory for the specific effect in general there is no implication that a contributory cause is necessary though it may be so in general a factor that is a contributory cause is not sufficient because it is by definition accompanied by other causes which would not count as causes if it were sufficient for the specific effect a factor that is on some occasions a contributory cause might on some other occasions be sufficient but on those other occasions it would not be merely contributory
j l mackie argues that usual talk of cause in fact refers to inus conditions insufficient but non-redundant parts of a condition which is itself unnecessary but sufficient for the occurrence of the effect an example is a short circuit as a cause for a house burning down consider the collection of events the short circuit the proximity of flammable material and the absence of firefighters together these are unnecessary but sufficient to the houses burning down since many other collections of events certainly could have led to the house burning down for example shooting the house with a flamethrower in the presence of oxygen and so forth within this collection the short circuit is an insufficient since the short circuit by itself would not have caused the fire but non-redundant because the fire would not have happened without it everything else being equal part of a condition which is itself unnecessary but sufficient for the occurrence of the effect so the short circuit is an inus condition for the occurrence of the house burning down


 contrasted with conditionals 
conditional statements are not statements of causality an important distinction is that statements of causality require the antecedent to precede or coincide with the consequent in time whereas conditional statements do not require this temporal order confusion commonly arises since many different statements in english may be presented using if  then  form and arguably because this form is far more commonly used to make a statement of causality the two types of statements are distinct however
for example all of the following statements are true when interpreting if  then  as the material conditional
if barack obama is president of the united states in 2011 then germany is in europe
if george washington is president of the united states in 2011 then arbitrary statement
the first is true since both the antecedent and the consequent are true the second is true in sentential logic and indeterminate in natural language regardless of the consequent statement that follows because the antecedent is false
the ordinary indicative conditional has somewhat more structure than the material conditional for instance although the first is the closest neither of the preceding two statements seems true as an ordinary indicative reading but the sentence
if shakespeare of stratford-on-avon did not write macbeth then someone else did
intuitively seems to be true even though there is no straightforward causal relation in this hypothetical situation between shakespeares not writing macbeth and someone elses actually writing it
another sort of conditional the counterfactual conditional has a stronger connection with causality yet even counterfactual statements are not all examples of causality consider the following two statements
if a were a triangle then a would have three sides
if switch s were thrown then bulb b would light
in the first case it would not be correct to say that as being a triangle caused it to have three sides since the relationship between triangularity and three-sidedness is that of definition the property of having three sides actually determines as state as a triangle nonetheless even when interpreted counterfactually the first statement is true an early version of aristotles four cause theory is described as recognizing essential cause in this version of the theory that the closed polygon has three sides is said to be the essential cause of its being a triangle this use of the word cause is of course now far obsolete nevertheless it is within the scope of ordinary language to say that it is essential to a triangle that it has three sides
a full grasp of the concept of conditionals is important to understanding the literature on causality in everyday language loose conditional statements are often enough made and need to be interpreted carefully


 questionable cause 

fallacies of questionable cause also known as causal fallacies non-causa pro causa latin for non-cause for cause or false cause are informal fallacies where a cause is incorrectly identified


 theories 


 counterfactual theories 

subjunctive conditionals are familiar from ordinary language they are of the form if a were the case then b would be the case or if a had been the case then b would have been the case counterfactual conditionals are specifically subjunctive conditionals whose antecedents are in fact false hence the name however the term used technically may apply to conditionals with true antecedents as well
psychological research shows that peoples thoughts about the causal relationships between events influences their judgments of the plausibility of counterfactual alternatives and conversely their counterfactual thinking about how a situation could have turned out differently changes their judgments of the causal role of events and agents nonetheless their identification of the cause of an event and their counterfactual thought about how the event could have turned out differently do not always coincide people distinguish between various sorts of causes eg strong and weak causes research in the psychology of reasoning shows that people make different sorts of inferences from different sorts of causes as found in the fields of cognitive linguistics and accident analysis for example
in the philosophical literature the suggestion that causation is to be defined in terms of a counterfactual relation is made by the 18th century scottish philosopher david hume hume remarks that we may define the relation of cause and effect such that where if the first object had not been the second never had existed
more full-fledged analysis of causation in terms of counterfactual conditionals only came in the 20th century after development of the possible world semantics for the evaluation of counterfactual conditionals in his 1973 paper causation david lewis proposed the following definition of the notion of causal dependence
an event e causally depends on c if and only if i if c had occurred then e would have occurred and ii if c had not occurred then e would not have occurred
causation is then defined as a chain of causal dependence that is c causes e if and only if there exists a sequence of events c d1 d2  dk e such that each event in the sequence depends on the previous
note that the analysis does not purport to explain how we make causal judgements or how we reason about causation but rather to give a metaphysical account of what it is for there to be a causal relation between some pair of events if correct the analysis has the power to explain certain features of causation knowing that causation is a matter of counterfactual dependence we may reflect on the nature of counterfactual dependence to account for the nature of causation for example in his paper counterfactual dependence and times arrow lewis sought to account for the time-directedness of counterfactual dependence in terms of the semantics of the counterfactual conditional if correct this theory can serve to explain a fundamental part of our experience which is that we can only causally affect the future but not the past


 probabilistic causation 

interpreting causation as a deterministic relation means that if a causes b then a must always be followed by b in this sense war does not cause deaths nor does smoking cause cancer or emphysema as a result many turn to a notion of probabilistic causation informally a the person is a smoker probabilistically causes b the person has now or will have cancer at some time in the future if the information that a occurred increases the likelihood of bs occurrence formally pba≥ pb where pba is the conditional probability that b will occur given the information that a occurred and pbis the probability that b will occur having no knowledge whether a did or did not occur this intuitive condition is not adequate as a definition for probabilistic causation because of its being too general and thus not meeting our intuitive notion of cause and effect for example if a denotes the event the person is a smoker b denotes the event the person now has or will have cancer at some time in the future and c denotes the event the person now has or will have emphysema some time in the future then the following three relationships hold pba ≥ pb pca ≥ pc and pbc ≥ pb the last relationship states that knowing that the person has emphysema increases the likelihood that he will have cancer the reason for this is that having the information that the person has emphysema increases the likelihood that the person is a smoker thus indirectly increasing the likelihood that the person will have cancer however we would not want to conclude that having emphysema causes cancer thus we need additional conditions such as temporal relationship of a to b and a rational explanation as to the mechanism of action it is hard to quantify this last requirement and thus different authors prefer somewhat different definitions


 causal calculus 
when experimental interventions are infeasible or illegal the derivation of cause effect relationship from observational studies must rest on some qualitative theoretical assumptions for example that symptoms do not cause diseases usually expressed in the form of missing arrows in causal graphs such as bayesian networks or path diagrams the theory underlying these derivations relies on the distinction between conditional probabilities as in 
  
    
      
        p
        
        c
        a
        n

        o
        k
        i
        n
        g
        
      
    
    displaystyle pcancersmoking
   and interventional probabilities as in 
  
    
      
        p
        
        c
        a
        n
        c

   the former reads the probability of finding cancer in a person known to smoke having started unforced by the experimenter to do so at an unspecified time in the past while the latter reads the probability of finding cancer in a person forced by the experimenter to smoke at a specified time in the past the former is a statistical notion that can be estimated by observation with negligible intervention by the experimenter while the latter is a causal notion which is estimated in an experiment with an important controlled randomized intervention it is specifically characteristic of quantal phenomena that observations defined by incompatible variables always involve important intervention by the experimenter as described quantitatively by the heisenberg uncertainty principle in classical thermodynamics processes are initiated by interventions called thermodynamic operations in other branches of science for example astronomy the experimenter can often observe with negligible intervention
the theory of causal calculus permits one to infer interventional probabilities from conditional probabilities in causal bayesian networks with unmeasured variables one very practical result of this theory is the characterization of confounding variables namely a sufficient set of variables that if adjusted for would yield the correct causal effect between variables of interest it can be shown that a sufficient set for estimating the causal effect of

   after removing all arrows emanating from

    displaystyle x
   this criterion called backdoor provides a mathematical definition of confounding and helps researchers identify accessible sets of variables worthy of measurement


 structure learning 
while derivations in causal calculus rely on the structure of the causal graph parts of the causal structure can under certain assumptions be learned from statistical data the basic idea goes back to sewall wrights 1921 work on path analysis a recovery algorithm was developed by rebane and pearl 1987 which rests on wrights distinction between the three possible types of causal substructures allowed in a directed acyclic graph dag

  
    
      
        x
        →
        y
        →
        z
      
    
    displaystyle xrightarrow yrightarrow z
  

  
    
      
        x
        ←
        y
        →
        z
      
    
    displaystyle xleftarrow yrightarrow z
  

  
    
      
        x
        →
        y
        ←
        z
      
    
    displaystyle xrightarrow yleftarrow z
  
type 1 and type 2 represent the same statistical dependencies ie 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    displaystyle x
   and 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    displaystyle z
   are independent given 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    displaystyle y
   and are therefore indistinguishable within purely cross-sectional data type 3 however can be uniquely identified since 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    displaystyle x
   and 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    displaystyle z
   are marginally independent and all other pairs are dependent thus while the skeletons the graphs stripped of arrows of these three triplets are identical the directionality of the arrows is partially identifiable the same distinction applies when 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    displaystyle x
   and 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    displaystyle z
   have common ancestors except that one must first condition on those ancestors algorithms have been developed to systematically determine the skeleton of the underlying graph and then orient all arrows whose directionality is dictated by the conditional independencies observed
alternative methods of structure learning search through the many possible causal structures among the variables and remove ones which are strongly incompatible with the observed correlations in general this leaves a set of possible causal relations which should then be tested by analyzing time series data or preferably designing appropriately controlled experiments in contrast with bayesian networks path analysis and its generalization structural equation modeling serve better to estimate a known causal effect or to test a causal model than to generate causal hypotheses
for nonexperimental data causal direction can often be inferred if information about time is available this is because according to many though not all theories causes must precede their effects temporally this can be determined by statistical time series models for instance or with a statistical test based on the idea of granger causality or by direct experimental manipulation the use of temporal data can permit statistical tests of a pre-existing theory of causal direction for instance our degree of confidence in the direction and nature of causality is much greater when supported by cross-correlations arima models or cross-spectral analysis using vector time series data than by cross-sectional data


 derivation theories 
nobel prize laureate herbert a simon and philosopher nicholas rescher claim that the asymmetry of the causal relation is unrelated to the asymmetry of any mode of implication that contraposes rather a causal relation is not a relation between values of variables but a function of one variable the cause on to another the effect so given a system of equations and a set of variables appearing in these equations we can introduce an asymmetric relation among individual equations and variables that corresponds perfectly to our commonsense notion of a causal ordering the system of equations must have certain properties most importantly if some values are chosen arbitrarily the remaining values will be determined uniquely through a path of serial discovery that is perfectly causal they postulate the inherent serialization of such a system of equations may correctly capture causation in all empirical fields including physics and economics


 manipulation theories 
some theorists have equated causality with manipulability under these theories x causes y only in the case that one can change x in order to change y this coincides with commonsense notions of causations since often we ask causal questions in order to change some feature of the world for instance we are interested in knowing the causes of crime so that we might find ways of reducing it
these theories have been criticized on two primary grounds first theorists complain that these accounts are circular attempting to reduce causal claims to manipulation requires that manipulation is more basic than causal interaction but describing manipulations in non-causal terms has provided a substantial difficulty
the second criticism centers around concerns of anthropocentrism it seems to many people that causality is some existing relationship in the world that we can harness for our desires if causality is identified with our manipulation then this intuition is lost in this sense it makes humans overly central to interactions in the world
some attempts to defend manipulability theories are recent accounts that dont claim to reduce causality to manipulation these accounts use manipulation as a sign or feature in causation without claiming that manipulation is more fundamental than causation


 process theories 
some theorists are interested in distinguishing between causal processes and non-causal processes russell 1948 salmon 1984 these theorists often want to distinguish between a process and a pseudo-process as an example a ball moving through the air a process is contrasted with the motion of a shadow a pseudo-process the former is causal in nature while the latter is not
salmon 1984 claims that causal processes can be identified by their ability to transmit an alteration over space and time an alteration of the ball a mark by a pen perhaps is carried with it as the ball goes through the air on the other hand an alteration of the shadow insofar as it is possible will not be transmitted by the shadow as it moves along
these theorists claim that the important concept for understanding causality is not causal relationships or causal interactions but rather identifying causal processes the former notions can then be defined in terms of causal processes


 fields 


 science 
for the scientific investigation of efficient causality the cause and effect are each best conceived of as temporally transient processes
within the conceptual frame of the scientific method an investigator sets up several distinct and contrasting temporally transient material processes that have the structure of experiments and records candidate material responses normally intending to determine causality in the physical world for instance one may want to know whether a high intake of carrots causes humans to develop the bubonic plague the quantity of carrot intake is a process that is varied from occasion to occasion the occurrence or non-occurrence of subsequent bubonic plague is recorded to establish causality the experiment must fulfill certain criteria only one example of which is mentioned here there are other criteria not mentioned here for example instances of the hypothesized cause must be set up to occur at a time when the hypothesized effect is relatively unlikely in the absence of the hypothesized cause such unlikelihood is to be established by empirical evidence a mere observation of a correlation is not nearly adequate to establish causality in nearly all cases establishment of causality relies on repetition of experiments and probabilistic reasoning hardly ever is causality established more firmly than as more or less probable it is often most convenient for establishment of causality if the contrasting material states of affairs are fully comparable and differ through only one variable factor perhaps measured by a real number otherwise experiments are usually difficult or impossible to interpret
in some sciences it is very difficult or nearly impossible to set up material states of affairs that closely test hypotheses of causality such sciences can in some sense be regarded as softer


 physics 

one has to be careful in the use of the word cause in physics properly speaking the hypothesized cause and the hypothesized effect are each temporally transient processes for example force is a useful concept for the explanation of acceleration but force is not by itself a cause more is needed for example a temporally transient process might be characterized by a definite change of force at a definite time such a process can be regarded as a cause causality is not inherently implied in equations of motion but postulated as an additional constraint that needs to be satisfied ie a cause always precedes its effect this constraint has mathematical implications such as the kramers-kronig relations
causality is one of the most fundamental and essential notions of physics causal efficacy cannot propagate faster than light otherwise reference coordinate systems could be constructed using the lorentz transform of special relativity in which an observer would see an effect precede its cause ie the postulate of causality would be violated
causal notions appear in the context of the flow of mass-energy for example it is commonplace to argue that causal efficacy can be propagated by waves such as electromagnetic waves only if they propagate no faster than light wave packets have group velocity and phase velocity for waves that propagate causal efficacy both of these must travel no faster than light thus light waves often propagate causal efficacy but de broglie waves often have phase velocity faster than light and consequently cannot be propagating causal efficacy
causal notions are important in general relativity to the extent that the existence of an arrow of time demands that the universes semi-riemannian manifold be orientable so that future and past are globally definable quantities


 engineering 
a causal system is a system with output and internal states that depends only on the current and previous input values a system that has some dependence on input values from the future in addition to possible past or current input values is termed an acausal system and a system that depends solely on future input values is an anticausal system acausal filters for example can only exist as postprocessing filters because these filters can extract future values from a memory buffer or a file


 biology medicine and epidemiology 
austin bradford hill built upon the work of hume and popper and suggested in his paper the environment and disease association or causation that aspects of an association such as strength consistency specificity and temporality be considered in attempting to distinguish causal from noncausal associations in the epidemiological situation see bradford-hill criteria he did not note however that temporality is the only necessary criterion among those aspects directed acyclic graphs dags are increasingly used in epidemiology to help enlighten causal thinking


 psychology 

psychologists take an empirical approach to causality investigating how people and non-human animals detect or infer causation from sensory information prior experience and innate knowledge
attribution
attribution theory is the theory concerning how people explain individual occurrences of causation attribution can be external assigning causality to an outside agent or force—claiming that some outside thing motivated the event or internal assigning causality to factors within the person—taking personal responsibility or accountability for ones actions and claiming that the person was directly responsible for the event taking causation one step further the type of attribution a person provides influences their future behavior
the intention behind the cause or the effect can be covered by the subject of action see also accident blame intent and responsibility
causal powers
whereas david hume argued that causes are inferred from non-causal observations immanuel kant claimed that people have innate assumptions about causes within psychology patricia cheng 1997 attempted to reconcile the humean and kantian views according to her power pc theory people filter observations of events through a basic belief that causes have the power to generate or prevent their effects thereby inferring specific cause-effect relations
causation and salience
our view of causation depends on what we consider to be the relevant events another way to view the statement lightning causes thunder is to see both lightning and thunder as two perceptions of the same event viz an electric discharge that we perceive first visually and then aurally
naming and causality
david sobel and alison gopnik from the psychology department of uc berkeley designed a device known as the blicket detector which would turn on when an object was placed on it their research suggests that even young children will easily and swiftly learn about a new causal power of an object and spontaneously use that information in classifying and naming the object
perception of launching events
some researchers such as anjan chatterjee at the university of pennsylvania and jonathan fugelsang at the university of waterloo are using neuroscience techniques to investigate the neural and psychological underpinnings of causal launching events in which one object causes another object to move both temporal and spatial factors can be manipulated
see causal reasoning psychology for more information


 statistics and economics 
statistics and economics usually employ pre-existing data or experimental data to infer causality by regression methods the body of statistical techniques involves substantial use of regression analysis typically a linear relationship such as

  
    
      
        
          y
          
            i

   and equivalently that 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            j

   causes y cannot be rejected on the other hand if the null hypothesis that

            j

   on y cannot be rejected here the notion of causality is one of contributory causality as discussed above if the true value

        ≠
        0
      
    
    displaystyle ajneq 0
   then a change in 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    displaystyle xj
   will result in a change in y unless some other causative variables either included in the regression or implicit in the error term change in such a way as to exactly offset its effect thus a change in 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    displaystyle xj
   is not sufficient to change y likewise a change in 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    displaystyle xj
   is not necessary to change y because a change in y could be caused by something implicit in the error term or by some other causative explanatory variable included in the model
the above way of testing for causality requires belief that there is no reverse causation in which y would cause 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    displaystyle xj
   this belief can be established in one of several ways first the variable 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    displaystyle xj
   may be a non-economic variable for example if rainfall amount 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    displaystyle xj
   is hypothesized to affect the futures price y of some agricultural commodity it is impossible that in fact the futures price affects rainfall amount provided that cloud seeding is never attempted second the instrumental variables technique may be employed to remove any reverse causation by introducing a role for other variables instruments that are known to be unaffected by the dependent variable third the principle that effects cannot precede causes can be invoked by including on the right side of the regression only variables that precede in time the dependent variable this principle is invoked for example in testing for granger causality and in its multivariate analog vector autoregression both of which control for lagged values of the dependent variable while testing for causal effects of lagged independent variables
regression analysis controls for other relevant variables by including them as regressors explanatory variables this helps to avoid false inferences of causality due to the presence of a third underlying variable that influences both the potentially causative variable and the potentially caused variable its effect on the potentially caused variable is captured by directly including it in the regression so that effect will not be picked up as an indirect effect through the potentially causative variable of interest


 metaphysics 
the deterministic world-view holds that the history of the universe can be exhaustively represented as a progression of events following one after as cause and effect the incompatibilist version of this holds that there is no such thing as free will compatibilism on the other hand holds that determinism is compatible with or even necessary for free will


 management 

for quality control in manufacturing in the 1960s kaoru ishikawa developed a cause and effect diagram known as an ishikawa diagram or fishbone diagram the diagram categorizes causes such as into the six main categories shown here these categories are then sub-divided ishikawas method identifies causes in brainstorming sessions conducted among various groups involved in the manufacturing process these groups can then be labeled as categories in the diagrams the use of these diagrams has now spread beyond quality control and they are used in other areas of management and in design and engineering ishikawa diagrams have been criticized for failing to make the distinction between necessary conditions and sufficient conditions it seems that ishikawa was not even aware of this distinction


 humanities 


 history 
in the discussion of history events are sometimes considered as if in some way being agents that can then bring about other historical events thus the combination of poor harvests the hardships of the peasants high taxes lack of representation of the people and kingly ineptitude are among the causes of the french revolution this is a somewhat platonic and hegelian view that reifies causes as ontological entities in aristotelian terminology this use approximates to the case of the efficient cause
some philosophers of history such as arthur danto have claimed that explanations in history and elsewhere describe not simply an event—something that happens—but a change like many practicing historians they treat causes as intersecting actions and sets of actions which bring about larger changes in danto’s words to decide what are the elements which persist through a change is rather simple when treating an individual’s shift in attitude but it is considerably more complex and metaphysically challenging when we are interested in such a change as say the break-up of feudalism or the emergence of nationalism
much of the historical debate about causes has focused on the relationship between communicative and other actions between singular and repeated ones and between actions structures of action or group and institutional contexts and wider sets of conditions john gaddis has distinguished between exceptional and general causes following marc bloch and between routine and distinctive links in causal relationships in accounting for what happened at hiroshima on august 6 1945 we attach greater importance to the fact that president truman ordered the dropping of an atomic bomb than to the decision of the army air force to carry out his orders he has also pointed to the difference between immediate intermediate and distant causes for his part christopher lloyd puts forward four general concepts of causation used in history the metaphysical idealist concept which asserts that the phenomena of the universe are products of or emanations from an omnipotent being or such final cause the empiricist or humean regularity concept which is based on the idea of causation being a matter of constant conjunctions of events the functionalteleologicalconsequential concept which is goal-directed so that goals are causes and the realist structurist and dispositional approach which sees relational structures and internal dispositions as the causes of phenomena


 law 

according to law and jurisprudence legal cause must be demonstrated to hold a defendant liable for a crime or a tort ie a civil wrong such as negligence or trespass it must be proven that causality or a sufficient causal link relates the defendants actions to the criminal event or damage in question causation is also an essential legal element that must be proven to qualify for remedy measures under international trade law


 theology 
note the concept of omnicausality in abrahamic theology which is the belief that god has set in motion all events at the dawn of time he is the determiner and the cause of all things it is therefore an attempt to rectify the apparent incompatibility between determinism and the existence of an omnipotent god

 hindu philosophy 

vedic period c 1750–500 bce literature has karmas eastern origins karma is the belief held by sanathana dharma and major religions that a persons actions cause certain effects in the current life andor in future life positively or negatively the various philosophical schools darsanas provide different accounts of the subject the doctrine of satkaryavada affirms that the effect inheres in the cause in some way the effect is thus either a real or apparent modification of the cause the doctrine of asatkaryavada affirms that the effect does not inhere in the cause but is a new arising see nyaya for some details of the theory of causation in the nyaya school in brahma samhita brahma describes krishna as the prime cause of all causes
bhagavad-gītā 18.14 identifies five causes for any action knowing which it can be perfected the body the individual soul the senses the efforts and the supersoul
according to monier-williams in the nyāya causation theory from sutra i.2i2 in the vaisheshika philosophy from causal non-existence is effectual non-existence but not effectual non-existence from causal non-existence a cause precedes an effect with a threads and cloth metaphors three causes are
co-inherence cause resulting from substantial contact substantial causes threads are substantial to cloth corresponding to aristotles material cause
non-substantial cause methods putting threads into cloth corresponding to aristotles formal cause
instrumental cause tools to make the cloth corresponding to aristotles efficient cause
monier-williams also proposed that aristotles and the nyayas causality are considered conditional aggregates necessary to mans productive work


 buddhist philosophy 

the general or universal definition of pratityasamutpada or dependent origination or dependent arising or interdependent co-arising is that everything arises in dependence upon multiple causes and conditions nothing exists as a singular independent entity a traditional example in buddhist texts is of three sticks standing upright and leaning against each other and supporting each other if one stick is taken away the other two will fall to the ground
causality in the chittamatrin buddhist school approach asangas c 400 ce mind-only buddhist school asserts that objects cause consciousness in the minds image because causes precede effects which must be different entities then subject and object are different for this school there are no objects which are entities external to a perceiving consciousness the chittamatrin and the yogachara svatantrika schools accept that there are no objects external to the observers causality this largely follows the nikayas approach
the abhidharmakośakārikā approach is vasubandhus abhidharma commentary text in the sarvāstivāda school c 500 ce it has four intricate causal conditioning constructions with the 1 root cause 2 immediate antecedent 3 object support and 4 predominance then the six causes are 1 instrumentality kāraṇahetu deemed the primary factor in result production 2 simultaneity or coexistence which connects phenomena that arise simultaneously 3 homogeneity explaining the homogenous flow that evokes phenomena continuity 4 association which operates only between mental factors and explains why consciousness appears as assemblages to mental factors 5 dominance which forms ones habitual cognitive and behaviorist dispositions and 6 fruition referring to whatever is the actively wholesome or unwholesome result the four conditions and six causes interact with each other in explaining phenomenal experience for instance each conscious moment acts both as the homogenous cause as well as the immediate antecedent consciousness condition rise and its concomitants in a subsequent moment
the vaibhashika c 500 ce is an early buddhist school which favors direct object contact and accepts simultaneous cause and effects this is based in the consciousness example which says intentions and feelings are mutually accompanying mental factors that support each other like poles in tripod in contrast simultaneous cause and effect rejectors say that if the effect already exists then it cannot effect the same way again how past present and future are accepted is a basis for various buddhist schools causality view points
all the classic buddhist schools teach karma the law of karma is a special instance of the law of cause and effect according to which all our actions of body speech and mind are causes and all our experiences are their effects
the bahai concept of causation has been a unifying force for this young religion the belief in a common biological and ideological ancestry has made it possible for bahais to recognize buddha moses jesus and muhammad unfortunately this has led to the systematic persecution of bahais by many caliphates


 western philosophy 


 aristotelian 

aristotle identified four kinds of answer or explanatory mode to various why questions he thought that for any given topic all four kinds of explanatory mode were important each in its own right as a result of traditional specialized philosophical peculiarities of language with translations between ancient greek latin and english the word cause is nowadays in specialized philosophical writings used to label aristotles four kinds in ordinary language there are various meanings of the word cause the commonest referring to efficient cause the topic of the present article
material cause the material whence a thing has come or that which persists while it changes as for example ones mother or the bronze of a statue see also substance theory
formal cause whereby a things dynamic form or static shape determines the things properties and function as a human differs from a statue of a human or as a statue differs from a lump of bronze
efficient cause which imparts the first relevant movement as a human lifts a rock or raises a statue this is the main topic of the present article
final cause the criterion of completion or the end it may refer to an action or to an inanimate process examples socrates takes a walk after dinner for the sake of his health earth falls to the lowest level because that is its nature
of aristotles four kinds or explanatory modes only one the efficient cause is a cause as defined in the leading paragraph of this present article the other three explanatory modes might be rendered material composition structure and dynamics and again criterion of completion the word that aristotle used was αἰτία for the present purpose that greek word would be better translated as explanation than as cause as those words are most often used in current english another translation of aristotle is that he meant the four becauses as four kinds of answer to why questions
aristotle assumed efficient causality as referring to a basic fact of experience not explicable by or reducible to anything more fundamental or basic
in some works of aristotle the four causes are listed as 1 the essential cause 2 the logical ground 3 the moving cause and 4 the final cause in this listing a statement of essential cause is a demonstration that an indicated object conforms to a definition of the word that refers to it a statement of logical ground is an argument as to why an object statement is true these are further examples of the idea that a cause in general in the context of aristotles usage is an explanation
the word efficient used here can also be translated from aristotle as moving or initiating
efficient causation was connected with aristotelian physics which recognized the four elements earth air fire water and added the fifth element aether water and earth by their intrinsic property gravitas or heaviness intrinsically fall toward whereas air and fire by their intrinsic property levitas or lightness intrinsically rise away from earths center—the motionless center of the universe—in a straight line while accelerating during the substances approach to its natural place
as air remained on earth however and did not escape earth while eventually achieving infinite speed—an absurdity—aristotle inferred that the universe is finite in size and contains an invisible substance that held planet earth and its atmosphere the sublunary sphere centered in the universe and since celestial bodies exhibit perpetual unaccelerated motion orbiting planet earth in unchanging relations aristotle inferred that the fifth element aither that fills space and composes celestial bodies intrinsically moves in perpetual circles the only constant motion between two points an object traveling a straight line from point a to b and back must stop at either point before returning to the other
left to itself a thing exhibits natural motion but can—according to aristotelian metaphysics—exhibit enforced motion imparted by an efficient cause the form of plants endows plants with the processes nutrition and reproduction the form of animals adds locomotion and the form of humankind adds reason atop these a rock normally exhibits natural motion—explained by the rocks material cause of being composed of the element earth—but a living thing can lift the rock an enforced motion diverting the rock from its natural place and natural motion as a further kind of explanation aristotle identified the final cause specifying a purpose or criterion of completion in light of which something should be understood
aristotle himself explained

cause means
a in one sense that as the result of whose presence something comes into being—eg the bronze of a statue and the silver of a cup and the classes which contain these ie the material cause
b in another sense the form or pattern that is the essential formula and the classes which contain it—eg the ratio 21 and number in general is the cause of the octave—and the parts of the formula ie the formal cause
c the source of the first beginning of change or rest eg the man who plans is a cause and the father is the cause of the child and in general that which produces is the cause of that which is produced and that which changes of that which is changed ie the efficient cause
d the same as end ie the final cause eg as the end of walking is health for why does a man walk to be healthy we say and by saying this we consider that we have supplied the cause the final cause
e all those means towards the end which arise at the instigation of something else as eg fat-reducing purging drugs and instruments are causes of health for they all have the end as their object although they differ from each other as being some instruments others actions ie necessary conditions

aristotle further discerned two modes of causation proper prior causation and accidental chance causation all causes proper and accidental can be spoken as potential or as actual particular or generic the same language refers to the effects of causes so that generic effects are assigned to generic causes particular effects to particular causes and actual effects to operating causes
averting infinite regress aristotle inferred the first mover—an unmoved mover the first movers motion too must have been caused but being an unmoved mover must have moved only toward a particular goal or desire


 middle ages 
in line with aristotelian cosmology thomas aquinas posed a hierarchy prioritizing aristotles four causes final  efficient  material  formal aquinas sought to identify the first efficient cause—now simply first cause—as everyone would agree said aquinas to call it god later in the middle ages many scholars conceded that the first cause was god but explained that many earthly events occur within gods design or plan and thereby scholars sought freedom to investigate the numerous secondary causes


 after the middle ages 
for aristotelian philosophy before aquinas the word cause had a broad meaning it meant answer to a why question or explanation and aristotelian scholars recognized four kinds of such answers with the end of the middle ages in many philosophical usages the meaning of the word cause narrowed it often lost that broad meaning and was restricted to just one of the four kinds for authors such as niccolò machiavelli in the field of political thinking and francis bacon concerning science more generally aristotles moving cause was the focus of their interest a widely used modern definition of causality in this newly narrowed sense was assumed by david hume he undertook an epistemological and metaphysical investigation of the notion of moving cause he denied that we can ever perceive cause and effect except by developing a habit or custom of mind where we come to associate two types of object or event always contiguous and occurring one after the other in part iii section xv of his book a treatise of human nature hume expanded this to a list of eight ways of judging whether two things might be cause and effect the first three
1 the cause and effect must be contiguous in space and time
2 the cause must be prior to the effect
3 there must be a constant union betwixt the cause and effect tis chiefly this quality that constitutes the relation
and then additionally there are three connected criteria which come from our experience and which are the source of most of our philosophical reasonings
4 the same cause always produces the same effect and the same effect never arises but from the same cause this principle we derive from experience and is the source of most of our philosophical reasonings
5 hanging upon the above hume says that where several different objects produce the same effect it must be by means of some quality which we discover to be common amongst them
6 and founded on the same reason the difference in the effects of two resembling objects must proceed from that particular in which they differ
and then two more
7 when any object increases or diminishes with the increase or diminution of its cause tis to be regarded as a compounded effect derivd from the union of the several different effects which arise from the several different parts of the cause
8 an object which exists for any time in its full perfection without any effect is not the sole cause of that effect but requires to be assisted by some other principle which may forward its influence and operation
in 1949 physicist max born distinguished determination from causality for him determination meant that actual events are so linked by laws of nature that certainly reliable predictions and retrodictions can be made from sufficient present data about them for him there are two kinds of causation which we may here call nomic or generic causation and singular causation nomic causality means that cause and effect are linked by more or less certain or probabilistic general laws covering many possible or potential instances we may recognize this as a probabilized version of criterion 3 of hume mentioned just above an occasion of singular causation is a particular occurrence of a definite complex of events that are physically linked by antecedence and contiguity which we may here recognize as criteria 1 and 2 of hume mentioned just above
