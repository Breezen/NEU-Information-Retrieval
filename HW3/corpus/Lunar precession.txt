precession is the change in orientation of an axis of rotation with respect to a reference plane the orbit of the moon undergoes two important types of precessional motion


 nodal precession 

the first type of lunar precession is that of the plane of the moons orbit the period of the lunar nodal precession is defined as the time it takes the ascending node to move through 360° relative to the vernal equinox it is about 18.6 years and the direction of motion is westward ie in the direction opposite to the earths orbit around the sun if seen from the celestial north this is the reason that a draconic month or nodal period the period the moon takes to return to the same node in its orbit is shorter than the sidereal month after one nodal precession period the number of draconic months exceeds the number of sidereal months by exactly one this period is about 6,793 days 18.60 years
as a result of this nodal precession the time for the sun to return to the same lunar node the eclipse year is about 18.6377 days shorter than a sidereal year the number of solar orbits years during one lunar nodal precession period equals the period of orbit one year divided by this difference minus one 365.2422∕18.6377 − 1


 apsidal precession 

the second kind of precession of the moons orbit is that of the major axis of the moons elliptic orbit the line of the apsides from perigee to apogee which precesses eastward by 360° in approximately 8.85 years this is the reason that an anomalistic month the period the moon moves from the perigee to the apogee and to the perigee again is longer than the sidereal month the period the moon takes to completes one orbit with respect to the fixed stars this apsidal precession completes one rotation in the same time as the number of sidereal months exceeds the number of anomalistic months by exactly one after about 3,233 days 8.85 years
