this article deals with predictive power in the context of the philosophy of science for a statistical measure of predictive power see mean squared prediction error

the concept of predictive power differs from explanatory and descriptive power where phenomena that are already known are retrospectively explained or described by a given theory in that it allows a prospective test of theoretical understanding


 examples 
a classic example of the predictive power of a theory is the discovery of neptune as a result of predictions made by mathematicians john couch adams and urbain le verrier based on newtons theory of gravity
other examples of predictive power of theories or models include dmitri mendeleevs use of his periodic table to predict previously undiscovered chemical elements and their properties though largely correct he misjudged the relative atomic masses of tellurium and iodine and charles darwins use of his knowledge of evolution by natural selection to predict that because there existed a plant angraecum with a long spur in its flowers a complementary animal with a 30 cm proboscis must also exist to feed on and pollinate it twenty years after his death xanthopan morganii a form of hawk moth was found which did just that
another example of predictive power is the prediction of einsteins general theory of relativity that the path of light would bend in the presence of a strong gravitational field this was experimentally verified by an expedition to sobral in brazil and the atlantic island of pr√≠ncipe to measure star positions during the solar eclipse of may 29 1919 when observations made by the astrophysicist arthur eddington seemed to confirm einsteins predictions although the measurements have been criticized by some as utilizing flawed methodology modern reanalysis of the data suggests that eddingtons analysis of the data was accurate later more precise measurements taken by radio interferometry confirmed the predictions to a high degree of accuracy


 applications 
the predictive power of a theory is closely related to applications 
general relativity not only predicts the bending of light but also predicts several other phenomena recently the calculation of proper time of satellites has been a successfully-measured prediction now incorporated into the method used to calculate positions via gps
if a theory has no predictive power it cannot be used for applications
