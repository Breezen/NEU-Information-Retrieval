the subsolar point on a planet is where its sun is perceived to be directly overhead in zenith that is where the suns rays are hitting the planet exactly perpendicular to its surface it can also mean the point closest to the sun on an object in space even though the sun might not be visible
for planets with an orientation and rotation similar to the earths the subsolar point will move westward circling the globe once a day approximately moving along a circle of latitude however it will also move north and south between the tropics over the course of a year so it is spiraling like a helix
the december solstice occurs when the subsolar point is on the tropic of capricorn and the june solstice is at the instant when the subsolar point is on the tropic of cancer the march and september equinoxes occur when the subsolar point crosses the equator
when the point passes through hawaii the only us state in which this happens it is known as lahaina noon
