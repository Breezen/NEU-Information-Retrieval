 high altitude astronomy 
the 1878 eclipse was a turning point in modern astronomy because it was the first time that many of the worlds leading astronomers had the opportunity to make their observations from the higher altitudes provided by the rocky mountains after the 1878 eclipse astronomers began to build observatories at locations well above sea level including on the sides and summits of mountains a scientific trend which extended throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first
