the total solar eclipse of july 11 2010 occurred over the southern pacific ocean a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between earth and the sun thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the sun for a viewer on earth a total solar eclipse occurs when the moons apparent diameter is larger than the suns blocking all direct sunlight turning day into darkness totality occurs in a narrow path across earths surface with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide


 visibility 

the eclipse on this day was one of the most remote in recorded history it was visible over much of the southern pacific ocean touching several atolls in french polynesia the cook islands easter island and argentinas patagonian plains
fred espenak a nasa astrophysicist said

one of the most unique things about this particular eclipse is that it crosses a unique and interesting archaeological site easter island on easter island there are these great statues theres a lot of mystery about these statues but in any case this is the first total eclipse to hit the island in about 1,400 years

in french polynesia the eclipse was seen with 98 percent totality during that time the diamond ring effect and the bailys beads occurred
it ended at sunset over the southern tips of argentina and chile in south america including the town of el calafate the suns altitude was only 1° during the 2 minute 47 second total phase but argentino lake offered an adequate line-of-sight to the eclipse hanging just above the rugged andes skyline
a 58% partiality occurred at sunset in santiago chile but it was not visible due to adverse weather conditions in other cities such as valparaíso and coquimbo clearer skies permitted the event to be witnessed in continental chile

this eclipse was the first one to happen over french polynesia in 350 years an estimated 5,000 tourists visited various islands in the archipelago to observe the event nearly 120,000 pairs of special glasses were distributed for observers eclipse chasers were also able to observe the eclipse at el calafate near the southern tip of argentina before the sun set just two minutes later
