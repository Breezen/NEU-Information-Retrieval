i have never encountered anyone who matched his command of the english language sentences poured forth in mellifluous constructions complicated enough to test the listener’s intelligence and simultaneously leave him transfixed by the speakers virtuosity

his grasp of history and fluency in ten languages enhanced his speech-making in the united nations even to skeptical or hostile audiences in 1952 eban was elected vice president of the un general assembly a collection of eban’s speeches before the united nations’ security council and general assembly both at universities and other venues between 1948 and 1968 was compiled in voice of israel recently reissued in ebook form by plunkett lake press
