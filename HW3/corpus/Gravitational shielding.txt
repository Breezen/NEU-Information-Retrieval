the term gravitational shielding refers to a hypothetical process of shielding an object from the influence of a gravitational field such processes if they existed would have the effect of reducing the weight of an object the shape of the shielded region would be similar to a shadow from the gravitational shield for example the shape of the shielded region above a disk would be conical the height of the cones apex above the disk would vary directly with the height of the shielding disk above the earth experimental evidence to date indicates that no such effect exists gravitational shielding is considered to be a violation of the equivalence principle and therefore inconsistent with both newtonian theory and general relativity
the concept of gravity shielding is a common concept in science fiction literature especially for space travel one of the first and best known examples is the fictional gravity shielding substance cavorite that appears in h g wells classic 1901 novel the first men in the moon wells was promptly criticized for using it by jules verne


 tests of the equivalence principle 
as of 2008 no experiment was successful in detecting positive shielding results to quantify the amount of shielding at the beginning of 20th century quirino majorana suggested an extinction coefficient h that modifies newton’s gravitational force law as follows

the best laboratory measurements have established an upper bound limit for shielding of 4.3×10−15 m²kg another recent analysis suggested a lower bound of 0.6×10−15 the best estimate based on the most accurate gravity anomaly data during the 1997 solar eclipse has provided a new constraint on the shielding parameter 6×10−19 m²kg however astronomical observations impose much more stringent limits based on lunar observations available in 1908 poincaré established that h can be no greater than 10−18 m²kg subsequently this bound has been greatly improved eckhardt showed that lunar ranging data implies an upper bound of 10−22 m²kg and williams et al have improved this to h  3 ± 5×10−22 m²kg note that the value is smaller than the uncertainty the consequence of the negative results of those experiments which are in good agreement with the predictions of general relativity is that every theory which contains shielding effects like le sages theory of gravitation must reduce those effects to an undetectable level for a review of the current experimental limits on possible gravitational shielding see the survey article by bertolami et al also for a discussion of recent observations during solar eclipses see the paper by unnikrishnan et al


 majoranas experiments and russells criticism 
some shielding experiments were conducted in the early 20th century by quirino majorana majorana claimed to have measured positive shielding effects henry norris russells analysis of the tidal forces showed that majoranas positive results had nothing to do with gravitational shielding to bring majoranas experiments in accordance with the equivalence principle of general relativity he proposed a model in which the mass of a body is diminished by the proximity of another body but he denied any connection between gravitational shielding and his proposal of mass variation for another explanation of majoranas experiments see coïsson et al but majoranas results couldnt be confirmed up to this day see the section above and russells mass variation theory although meant as a modification of general relativity is inconsistent with standard physics as well


 minority views 
the consensus view of the scientific community is that gravitational shielding does not exist but there have been occasional investigations into this topic such as the 1999 nasa-funded paper which reported negative results eugene podkletnov claimed in two papers one of which he later withdrew that objects held above a magnetically-levitated superconducting rotating disc underwent a reduction of between 0.5 and 2% in weight theoreticians have attempted to reconcile podkletnovs claims with quantum gravity theory however neither podkletnovs claims nor the similar claims of others of gravity reduction gravity shielding or the like have yet been successfully replicated verified by independent review or subjected to public demonstration
