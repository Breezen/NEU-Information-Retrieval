the earliest scientifically useful photograph of a total solar eclipse was made by julius berkowski at the royal observatory in königsberg prussia on july 28 1851 it was the first correctly exposed photographic image taken during totality thereby including the suns corona


 background 
a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the earth and the sun casting a shadow on earth that temporarily obscures part or all of the suns disc eclipses can occur only when all three bodies are properly aligned partial eclipses in which only a portion of the suns surface is obscured are relatively common due to the width of the moons outer shadow or penumbra which may be several hundred miles wide total eclipses occur when the moons inner shadow or umbra reaches the surface of the earth completely obscuring the sun over a much narrower portion of the ground if the moon is too far away at the time of an eclipse its umbra may not reach the earths surface and only a partial eclipse will be visible
before the advent of modern science solar eclipses were often viewed with superstitious dread however eclipses are also of interest to science due to the various phenomena that can be observed when they occur the corona is normally invisible due to the brightness of the solar disc but becomes visible from earth during a total eclipse until the twentieth century solar eclipses provided the only opportunity for scientists to observe and study the suns corona with the development of photography during the first half of the nineteenth century it became theoretically possible to record a still image of the sun during a total eclipse a variety of processes were used for early photographs of which the most successful was the daguerreotype


 july 28 1851 
photographing a rare event such as a total eclipse posed unique challenges for early photography including the extreme contrast between the corona and the dark shadow of the moon as well as the unusual angle to which photographic equipment had to be oriented prior to the eclipse of july 28 1851 no properly exposed photograph of the solar corona had yet been produced for this occasion the royal prussian observatory at königsberg now kaliningrad russia commissioned one of the citys most skilled daguerreotypists johann julius friedrich berkowski to record a still image of the event the observers attached a small six-centimeter refracting telescope to a 15.8 centimeter fraunhofer heliometer and berkowski made an eighty-four second exposure shortly after the beginning of totality
among the other observers were british astronomers robert grant and william swan and austrian astronomer karl ludwig von littrow they deduced that prominences were part of the sun because the moon was seen to cover and uncover them as it moved in front of the sun


 related eclipses 
the eclipse of july 28 1851 was part of saros series 143 a sequence of seventy-two partial and total solar eclipses occurring between 1617 and 2897 the only total eclipses in this cycle occurred between 1797 and 1995
