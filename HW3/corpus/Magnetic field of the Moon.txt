the magnetic field of the moon is very weak in comparison to that of the earth other major differences are that the moon does not currently have a dipolar magnetic field as would be generated by a geodynamo in its core and the varying magnetization that is present is almost entirely crustal in origin one hypothesis holds that the crustal magnetizations were acquired early in lunar history when a geodynamo was still operating an analysis of magnetized moon rocks brought to earth by apollo astronauts showed that the moon must have had a strong magnetic field at least 4.25 billion years ago which then slowly diminished up until 3.1 billion years ago the small size of the lunar core however is a potential obstacle to promoting that hypothesis to the status of theory alternatively it is possible that on an airless body such as the moon transient magnetic fields could be generated during large impact events in support of this it has been noted that the largest crustal magnetizations appear to be located near the antipodes of the giant impact basins it has been proposed that such a phenomenon could result from the free expansion of an impact-generated plasma cloud around the moon in the presence of an ambient magnetic field for example the chandrayaan-1 spacecraft mapped a mini-magnetosphere at the crisium antipode on the moons far side using its sub-kev atom reflecting analyzer sara instrument the mini-magnetosphere is 360 km across at the surface and is surrounded by a 300-km-thick region of enhanced plasma flux that results from the solar wind flowing around the mini-magnetosphere
theres growing evidence that fine particles of moondust might actually float ejected from the lunar surface by electrostatic repulsion this could create a temporary nighttime atmosphere of dust the moondust atmosphere might also gather itself into a sort of diaphanous wind drawn by differences in global charge accumulation floating dust would naturally fly from the strongly negative nightside to the weakly negative dayside this dust storm effect would be strongest at the moons terminator much of these details are still speculative but the lunar prospector spacecraft detected changes in the lunar nightside voltage during magnetotail crossings jumping from -200 v to -1000 v further characterization was done by the lunar atmosphere and dust environment explorer orbiter in late 2013
the plasma sheet is a very dynamic structure in a constant state of motion so as the moon orbits through the magnetotail the plasma sheet can sweep across it many times with encounters lasting anywhere from minutes to hours or even days
