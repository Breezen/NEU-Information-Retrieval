 fate 

once the goodwill display with the moon material was presented nasa offered no counseling or recommendations on how the caretaker or curator was to handle the moon rocks their fate was in the hands of the recipient which in many cases was not well managed nasa did not give away any moon rock displays other than what was given of the apollo 11 and apollo 17 moon rock displays
certain samples of moon rock and lunar dust soil from the apollo 11 and apollo 17 missions mounted on the wooden plaque displays especially for brazil canada cyprus honduras ireland malta netherlands nicaragua norway romania spain sweden alaska arkansas california colorado delaware hawaii illinois missouri nebraska new jersey new mexico new york north carolina oregon west virginia were later reported missing by many of the recipients since 2005 certain entities and key people have made concerted efforts to find the current locations of all the apollo lunar sample displays with the goodwill moon rocks one such person is joseph gutheinz former nasa office of inspector general special agent for 10 years who was a professor at the university of phoenix in arizona usa gutheinz even went to the extreme of having his hundreds of students try to locate all these displays another space history expert tracking the goodwill lunar displays is robert pearlman founder and editor of collectspace a website devoted to space-related artifacts and memorabilia
