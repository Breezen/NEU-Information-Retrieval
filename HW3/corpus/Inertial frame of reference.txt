an inertial frame of reference in classical physics is a frame of reference in which bodies whose net force acting upon them is zero are not accelerated that is they are at rest or they move at a constant velocity in a straight line in analytical terms it is a frame of reference that describes time and space homogeneously isotropically and in a time-independent manner conceptually in classical physics and special relativity the physics of a system in an inertial frame have no causes external to the system an inertial frame of reference may also be called an inertial reference frame inertial frame galilean reference frame or inertial space
all inertial frames are in a state of constant rectilinear motion with respect to one another an accelerometer moving with any of them would detect zero acceleration measurements in one inertial frame can be converted to measurements in another by a simple transformation the galilean transformation in newtonian physics and the lorentz transformation in special relativity in general relativity in any region small enough for the curvature of spacetime and tidal forces to be negligible one can find a set of inertial frames that approximately describe that region
in a non-inertial reference frame in classical physics and special relativity the physics of a system vary depending on the acceleration of that frame with respect to an inertial frame and the usual physical forces must be supplemented by fictitious forces in contrast systems in non-inertial frames in general relativity dont have external causes because of the principle of geodesic motion in classical physics for example a ball dropped towards the ground does not go exactly straight down because the earth is rotating which means the frame of reference of an observer on earth is not inertial the physics must account for the coriolis effect—in this case thought of as a force—to predict the horizontal motion another example of such a fictitious force associated with rotating reference frames is the centrifugal effect or centrifugal force


 introduction 
the motion of a body can only be described relative to something else—other bodies observers or a set of space-time coordinates these are called frames of reference if the coordinates are chosen badly the laws of motion may be more complex than necessary for example suppose a free body that has no external forces acting on it is at rest at some instant in many coordinate systems it would begin to move at the next instant even though there are no forces on it however a frame of reference can always be chosen in which it remains stationary similarly if space is not described uniformly or time independently a coordinate system could describe the simple flight of a free body in space as a complicated zig-zag in its coordinate system indeed an intuitive summary of inertial frames can be given in an inertial reference frame the laws of mechanics take their simplest form
in an inertial frame newtons first law the law of inertia is satisfied any free motion has a constant magnitude and direction newtons second law for a particle takes the form

with f the net force a vector m the mass of a particle and a the acceleration of the particle also a vector which would be measured by an observer at rest in the frame the force f is the vector sum of all real forces on the particle such as electromagnetic gravitational nuclear and so forth in contrast newtons second law in a rotating frame of reference rotating at angular rate ω about an axis takes the form

where the angular rotation of the frame is expressed by the vector ω pointing in the direction of the axis of rotation and with magnitude equal to the angular rate of rotation ω symbol × denotes the vector cross product vector xb locates the body and vector vb is the velocity of the body according to a rotating observer different from the velocity seen by the inertial observer
the extra terms in the force f′ are the fictitious forces for this frame whose causes are external to the system in the frame the first extra term is the coriolis force the second the centrifugal force and the third the euler force these terms all have these properties they vanish when ω  0 that is they are zero for an inertial frame which of course does not rotate they take on a different magnitude and direction in every rotating frame depending upon its particular value of ω they are ubiquitous in the rotating frame affect every particle regardless of circumstance and they have no apparent source in identifiable physical sources in particular matter also fictitious forces do not drop off with distance unlike for example nuclear forces or electrical forces for example the centrifugal force that appears to emanate from the axis of rotation in a rotating frame increases with distance from the axis
all observers agree on the real forces f only non-inertial observers need fictitious forces the laws of physics in the inertial frame are simpler because unnecessary forces are not present
in newtons time the fixed stars were invoked as a reference frame supposedly at rest relative to absolute space in reference frames that were either at rest with respect to the fixed stars or in uniform translation relative to these stars newtons laws of motion were supposed to hold in contrast in frames accelerating with respect to the fixed stars an important case being frames rotating relative to the fixed stars the laws of motion did not hold in their simplest form but had to be supplemented by the addition of fictitious forces for example the coriolis force and the centrifugal force two interesting experiments were devised by newton to demonstrate how these forces could be discovered thereby revealing to an observer that they were not in an inertial frame the example of the tension in the cord linking two spheres rotating about their center of gravity and the example of the curvature of the surface of water in a rotating bucket in both cases application of newtons second law would not work for the rotating observer without invoking centrifugal and coriolis forces to account for their observations tension in the case of the spheres parabolic water surface in the case of the rotating bucket
as we now know the fixed stars are not fixed those that reside in the milky way turn with the galaxy exhibiting proper motions those that are outside our galaxy such as nebulae once mistaken to be stars participate in their own motion as well partly due to expansion of the universe and partly due to peculiar velocities the andromeda galaxy is on collision course with the milky way at a speed of 117 kms the concept of inertial frames of reference is no longer tied to either the fixed stars or to absolute space rather the identification of an inertial frame is based upon the simplicity of the laws of physics in the frame in particular the absence of fictitious forces is their identifying property
in practice although not a requirement using a frame of reference based upon the fixed stars as though it were an inertial frame of reference introduces very little discrepancy for example the centrifugal acceleration of the earth because of its rotation about the sun is about thirty million times greater than that of the sun about the galactic center
to illustrate further consider the question does our universe rotate to answer we might attempt to explain the shape of the milky way galaxy using the laws of physics although other observations might be more definitive that is provide larger discrepancies or less measurement uncertainty like the anisotropy of the microwave background radiation or big bang nucleosynthesis the flatness of the milky way depends on its rate of rotation in an inertial frame of reference if we attribute its apparent rate of rotation entirely to rotation in an inertial frame a different flatness is predicted than if we suppose part of this rotation actually is due to rotation of the universe and should not be included in the rotation of the galaxy itself based upon the laws of physics a model is set up in which one parameter is the rate of rotation of the universe if the laws of physics agree more accurately with observations in a model with rotation than without it we are inclined to select the best-fit value for rotation subject to all other pertinent experimental observations if no value of the rotation parameter is successful and theory is not within observational error a modification of physical law is considered for example dark matter is invoked to explain the galactic rotation curve so far observations show any rotation of the universe is very slow no faster than once every 60·1012 years 10−13 radyr and debate persists over whether there is any rotation however if rotation were found interpretation of observations in a frame tied to the universe would have to be corrected for the fictitious forces inherent in such rotation in classical physics and special relativity or interpreted as the curvature of spacetime and the motion of matter along the geodesics in general relativity
when quantum effects are important there are additional conceptual complications that arise in quantum reference frames


 background 
a brief comparison of inertial frames in special relativity and in newtonian mechanics and the role of absolute space is next


 a set of frames where the laws of physics are simple 
according to the first postulate of special relativity all physical laws take their simplest form in an inertial frame and there exist multiple inertial frames interrelated by uniform translation 

special principle of relativity if a system of coordinates k is chosen so that in relation to it physical laws hold good in their simplest form the same laws hold good in relation to any other system of coordinates k moving in uniform translation relatively to k

this simplicity manifests in that inertial frames have self-contained physics without the need for external causes while physics in non-inertial frames have external causes the principle of simplicity can be used within newtonian physics as well as in special relativity see nagel and also blagojević

the laws of newtonian mechanics do not always hold in their simplest formif for instance an observer is placed on a disc rotating relative to the earth heshe will sense a force pushing himher toward the periphery of the disc which is not caused by any interaction with other bodies here the acceleration is not the consequence of the usual force but of the so-called inertial force newtons laws hold in their simplest form only in a family of reference frames called inertial frames this fact represents the essence of the galilean principle of relativity
   the laws of mechanics have the same form in all inertial frames

in practical terms the equivalence of inertial reference frames means that scientists within a box moving uniformly cannot determine their absolute velocity by any experiment otherwise the differences would set up an absolute standard reference frame according to this definition supplemented with the constancy of the speed of light inertial frames of reference transform among themselves according to the poincaré group of symmetry transformations of which the lorentz transformations are a subgroup in newtonian mechanics which can be viewed as a limiting case of special relativity in which the speed of light is infinite inertial frames of reference are related by the galilean group of symmetries


 absolute space 

newton posited an absolute space considered well approximated by a frame of reference stationary relative to the fixed stars an inertial frame was then one in uniform translation relative to absolute space however some scientists called relativists by mach even at the time of newton felt that absolute space was a defect of the formulation and should be replaced
indeed the expression inertial frame of reference german inertialsystem was coined by ludwig lange in 1885 to replace newtons definitions of absolute space and time by a more operational definition as translated by iro lange proposed the following definition

a reference frame in which a mass point thrown from the same point in three different non co-planar directions follows rectilinear paths each time it is thrown is called an inertial frame

a discussion of langes proposal can be found in mach
the inadequacy of the notion of absolute space in newtonian mechanics is spelled out by blagojević

the existence of absolute space contradicts the internal logic of classical mechanics since according to galilean principle of relativity none of the inertial frames can be singled out
absolute space does not explain inertial forces since they are related to acceleration with respect to any one of the inertial frames
absolute space acts on physical objects by inducing their resistance to acceleration but it cannot be acted upon

the utility of operational definitions was carried much further in the special theory of relativity some historical background including langes definition is provided by disalle who says in summary

the original question relative to what frame of reference do the laws of motion hold is revealed to be wrongly posed for the laws of motion essentially determine a class of reference frames and in principle a procedure for constructing them


 newtons inertial frame of reference 

within the realm of newtonian mechanics an inertial frame of reference or inertial reference frame is one in which newtons first law of motion is valid however the principle of special relativity generalizes the notion of inertial frame to include all physical laws not simply newtons first law
newton viewed the first law as valid in any reference frame that is in uniform motion relative to the fixed stars that is neither rotating nor accelerating relative to the stars today the notion of absolute space is abandoned and an inertial frame in the field of classical mechanics is defined as

an inertial frame of reference is one in which the motion of a particle not subject to forces is in a straight line at constant speed

hence with respect to an inertial frame an object or body accelerates only when a physical force is applied and following newtons first law of motion in the absence of a net force a body at rest will remain at rest and a body in motion will continue to move uniformly—that is in a straight line and at constant speed newtonian inertial frames transform among each other according to the galilean group of symmetries
if this rule is interpreted as saying that straight-line motion is an indication of zero net force the rule does not identify inertial reference frames because straight-line motion can be observed in a variety of frames if the rule is interpreted as defining an inertial frame then we have to be able to determine when zero net force is applied the problem was summarized by einstein

the weakness of the principle of inertia lies in this that it involves an argument in a circle a mass moves without acceleration if it is sufficiently far from other bodies we know that it is sufficiently far from other bodies only by the fact that it moves without acceleration

there are several approaches to this issue one approach is to argue that all real forces drop off with distance from their sources in a known manner so we have only to be sure that a body is far enough away from all sources to ensure that no force is present a possible issue with this approach is the historically long-lived view that the distant universe might affect matters machs principle another approach is to identify all real sources for real forces and account for them a possible issue with this approach is that we might miss something or account inappropriately for their influence perhaps again due to machs principle and an incomplete understanding of the universe a third approach is to look at the way the forces transform when we shift reference frames fictitious forces those that arise due to the acceleration of a frame disappear in inertial frames and have complicated rules of transformation in general cases on the basis of universality of physical law and the request for frames where the laws are most simply expressed inertial frames are distinguished by the absence of such fictitious forces
newton enunciated a principle of relativity himself in one of his corollaries to the laws of motion

the motions of bodies included in a given space are the same among themselves whether that space is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a straight line

this principle differs from the special principle in two ways first it is restricted to mechanics and second it makes no mention of simplicity it shares with the special principle the invariance of the form of the description among mutually translating reference frames the role of fictitious forces in classifying reference frames is pursued further below


 separating non-inertial from inertial reference frames 


 theory 

inertial and non-inertial reference frames can be distinguished by the absence or presence of fictitious forces as explained shortly

the effect of this being in the noninertial frame is to require the observer to introduce a fictitious force into his calculations…

the presence of fictitious forces indicates the physical laws are not the simplest laws available so in terms of the special principle of relativity a frame where fictitious forces are present is not an inertial frame

the equations of motion in a non-inertial system differ from the equations in an inertial system by additional terms called inertial forces this allows us to detect experimentally the non-inertial nature of a system

bodies in non-inertial reference frames are subject to so-called fictitious forces pseudo-forces that is forces that result from the acceleration of the reference frame itself and not from any physical force acting on the body examples of fictitious forces are the centrifugal force and the coriolis force in rotating reference frames
how then are fictitious forces to be separated from real forces it is hard to apply the newtonian definition of an inertial frame without this separation for example consider a stationary object in an inertial frame being at rest no net force is applied but in a frame rotating about a fixed axis the object appears to move in a circle and is subject to centripetal force which is made up of the coriolis force and the centrifugal force how can we decide that the rotating frame is a non-inertial frame there are two approaches to this resolution one approach is to look for the origin of the fictitious forces the coriolis force and the centrifugal force we will find there are no sources for these forces no associated force carriers no originating bodies a second approach is to look at a variety of frames of reference for any inertial frame the coriolis force and the centrifugal force disappear so application of the principle of special relativity would identify these frames where the forces disappear as sharing the same and the simplest physical laws and hence rule that the rotating frame is not an inertial frame
newton examined this problem himself using rotating spheres as shown in figure 2 and figure 3 he pointed out that if the spheres are not rotating the tension in the tying string is measured as zero in every frame of reference if the spheres only appear to rotate that is we are watching stationary spheres from a rotating frame the zero tension in the string is accounted for by observing that the centripetal force is supplied by the centrifugal and coriolis forces in combination so no tension is needed if the spheres really are rotating the tension observed is exactly the centripetal force required by the circular motion thus measurement of the tension in the string identifies the inertial frame it is the one where the tension in the string provides exactly the centripetal force demanded by the motion as it is observed in that frame and not a different value that is the inertial frame is the one where the fictitious forces vanish
so much for fictitious forces due to rotation however for linear acceleration newton expressed the idea of undetectability of straight-line accelerations held in common

if bodies any how moved among themselves are urged in the direction of parallel lines by equal accelerative forces they will continue to move among themselves after the same manner as if they had been urged by no such forces

this principle generalizes the notion of an inertial frame for example an observer confined in a free-falling lift will assert that he himself is a valid inertial frame even if he is accelerating under gravity so long as he has no knowledge about anything outside the lift so strictly speaking inertial frame is a relative concept with this in mind we can define inertial frames collectively as a set of frames which are stationary or moving at constant velocity with respect to each other so that a single inertial frame is defined as an element of this set
for these ideas to apply everything observed in the frame has to be subject to a base-line common acceleration shared by the frame itself that situation would apply for example to the elevator example where all objects are subject to the same gravitational acceleration and the elevator itself accelerates at the same rate


 applications 
inertial navigation systems used a cluster of gyroscopes and accelerometers to determine accelerations relative to inertial space after a gyroscope is spun up in a particular orientation in inertial space the law of conservation of angular momentum requires that it retain that orientation as long as no external forces are applied to it three orthogonal gyroscopes establish an inertial reference frame and the accelerators measure acceleration relative to that frame the accelerations along with a clock can then be used to calculate the change in position thus inertial navigation is a form of dead reckoning that requires no external input and therefore cannot be jammed by any external or internal signal source
a gyrocompass employed for navigation of seagoing vessels finds the geometric north it does so not by sensing the earths magnetic field but by using inertial space as its reference the outer casing of the gyrocompass device is held in such a way that it remains aligned with the local plumb line when the gyroscope wheel inside the gyrocompass device is spun up the way the gyroscope wheel is suspended causes the gyroscope wheel to gradually align its spinning axis with the earths axis alignment with the earths axis is the only direction for which the gyroscopes spinning axis can be stationary with respect to the earth and not be required to change direction with respect to inertial space after being spun up a gyrocompass can reach the direction of alignment with the earths axis in as little as a quarter of an hour


 newtonian mechanics 

classical mechanics which includes relativity assumes the equivalence of all inertial reference frames newtonian mechanics makes the additional assumptions of absolute space and absolute time given these two assumptions the coordinates of the same event a point in space and time described in two inertial reference frames are related by a galilean transformation

where r0 and t0 represent shifts in the origin of space and time and v is the relative velocity of the two inertial reference frames under galilean transformations the time t2 − t1 between two events is the same for all inertial reference frames and the distance between two simultaneous events or equivalently the length of any object r2 − r1 is also the same


 special relativity 

einsteins theory of special relativity like newtonian mechanics assumes the equivalence of all inertial reference frames but makes an additional assumption foreign to newtonian mechanics namely that in free space light always is propagated with the speed of light c0 a defined value independent of its direction of propagation and its frequency and also independent of the state of motion of the emitting body this second assumption has been verified experimentally and leads to counter-intuitive deductions including
time dilation moving clocks tick more slowly
length contraction moving objects are shortened in the direction of motion
relativity of simultaneity simultaneous events in one reference frame are not simultaneous in almost all frames moving relative to the first
these deductions are logical consequences of the stated assumptions and are general properties of space-time typically without regard to a consideration of properties pertaining to the structure of individual objects like atoms or stars nor to the mechanisms of clocks
these effects are expressed mathematically by the lorentz transformation

the lorentz transformation is equivalent to the galilean transformation in the limit c0 → ∞ a hypothetical case or v → 0 low speeds
under lorentz transformations the time and distance between events may differ among inertial reference frames however the lorentz scalar distance s between two events is the same in all inertial reference frames

from this perspective the speed of light is only accidentally a property of light and is rather a property of spacetime a conversion factor between conventional time units such as seconds and length units such as meters
incidentally because of the limitations on speeds faster than the speed of light notice that in a rotating frame of reference which is a non-inertial frame of course stationarity is not possible at arbitrary distances because at large radius the object would move faster than the speed of light


 general relativity 

general relativity is based upon the principle of equivalence

there is no experiment observers can perform to distinguish whether an acceleration arises because of a gravitational force or because their reference frame is accelerating

this idea was introduced in einsteins 1907 article principle of relativity and gravitation and later developed in 1911 support for this principle is found in the eötvös experiment which determines whether the ratio of inertial to gravitational mass is the same for all bodies regardless of size or composition to date no difference has been found to a few parts in 1011 for some discussion of the subtleties of the eötvös experiment such as the local mass distribution around the experimental site including a quip about the mass of eötvös himself see franklin
einstein’s general theory modifies the distinction between nominally inertial and noninertial effects by replacing special relativitys flat minkowski space with a metric that produces non-zero curvature in general relativity the principle of inertia is replaced with the principle of geodesic motion whereby objects move in a way dictated by the curvature of spacetime as a consequence of this curvature it is not a given in general relativity that inertial objects moving at a particular rate with respect to each other will continue to do so this phenomenon of geodesic deviation means that inertial frames of reference do not exist globally as they do in newtonian mechanics and special relativity
however the general theory reduces to the special theory over sufficiently small regions of spacetime where curvature effects become less important and the earlier inertial frame arguments can come back into play consequently modern special relativity is now sometimes described as only a local theory local can encompass for example the entire milky way galaxy the astronomer karl schwarzschild observed the motion of pairs of stars orbiting each other he found that the two orbits of the stars of such a system lie in a plane and the perihelion of the orbits of the two stars remains pointing in the same direction with respect to the solar system schwarzschild pointed out that that was invariably seen the direction of the angular momentum of all observed double star systems remains fixed with respect to the direction of the angular momentum of the solar system these observations allowed him to conclude that inertial frames inside the galaxy do not rotate with respect to one another and that the space of the milky way is approximately galilean or minkowskian
