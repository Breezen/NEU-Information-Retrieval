the latin phrases a priori lit from the earlier and a posteriori lit from the latter are philosophical terms of art popularized by immanuel kants critique of pure reason first published in 1781 second edition in 1787 one of the most influential works in the history of philosophy however in their latin forms they appear in latin translations of euclids elements of about 300 bce a work widely considered during the early european modern period as the model for precise thinking
these terms are used with respect to reasoning epistemology to distinguish necessary conclusions from first premises ie what must come before sense observation from conclusions based on sense observation which must follow it thus the two kinds of knowledge justification or argument may be glossed
a priori knowledge or justification is independent of experience as with mathematics 3  2  5 tautologies all bachelors are unmarried and deduction from pure reason eg ontological proofs
a posteriori knowledge or justification depends on experience or empirical evidence as with most aspects of science and personal knowledge
there are many points of view on these two types of knowledge and their relationship gives rise to one of the oldest problems in modern philosophy
the terms a priori and a posteriori are primarily used as adjectives to modify the noun knowledge for example a priori knowledge however a priori is sometimes used to modify other nouns such as truth philosophers also may use apriority and aprioricity as nouns to refer approximately to the quality of being a priori
although definitions and use of the terms have varied in the history of philosophy they have consistently labeled two separate epistemological notions see also the related distinctions deductiveinductive analyticsynthetic necessarycontingent


 examples 
the intuitive distinction between a priori and a posteriori knowledge or justification is best seen via examples as below
a priori
consider the proposition if george v reigned at least four days then he reigned more than three days this is something that one knows a priori because it expresses a statement that one can derive by reason alone
a posteriori
compare this with the proposition expressed by the sentence george v reigned from 1910 to 1936 this is something that if true one must come to know a posteriori because it expresses an empirical fact unknowable by reason alone


 analyticity and necessity 


 relation to the analytic-synthetic 

several philosophers reacting to kant sought to explain a priori knowledge without appealing to as paul boghossian md explains a special faculty  that has never been described in satisfactory terms one theory popular among the logical positivists of the early 20th century is what boghossian calls the analytic explanation of the a priori the distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions was first introduced by kant while kants original distinction was primarily drawn in terms of conceptual containment the contemporary version of the distinction primarily involves as the american philosopher w v o quine put it the notions of true by virtue of meanings and independently of fact analytic propositions are thought to be true in virtue of their meaning alone while a posteriori analytic propositions are thought to be true in virtue of their meaning and certain facts about the world according to the analytic explanation of the a priori all a priori knowledge is analytic so a priori knowledge need not require a special faculty of pure intuition since it can be accounted for simply by ones ability to understand the meaning of the proposition in question in short proponents of this explanation claimed to have reduced a dubious metaphysical faculty of pure reason to a legitimate linguistic notion of analyticity
however the analytic explanation of a priori knowledge has undergone several criticisms most notably quine argued that the analytic–synthetic distinction is illegitimate quine states but for all its a priori reasonableness a boundary between analytic and synthetic statements simply has not been drawn that there is such a distinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of empiricists a metaphysical article of faith while the soundness of quines critique is highly disputed it had a powerful effect on the project of explaining the a priori in terms of the analytic


 relation to the necessarycontingent 
the metaphysical distinction between necessary and contingent truths has also been related to a priori and a posteriori knowledge a proposition that is necessarily true is one whose negation is self-contradictory thus it is said to be true in every possible world consider the proposition that all bachelors are unmarried its negation the proposition that some bachelors are married is incoherent because the concept of being unmarried or the meaning of the word unmarried is part of the concept of being a bachelor or part of the definition of the word bachelor to the extent that contradictions are impossible self-contradictory propositions are necessarily false because it is impossible for them to be true thus the negation of a self-contradictory proposition is supposed to be necessarily true by contrast a proposition that is contingently true is one whose negation is not self-contradictory thus it is said that it is not true in every possible world as jason baehr states it seems plausible that all necessary propositions are known a priori because sense experience can tell us only about the actual world and hence about what is the case it can say nothing about what must or must not be the case
following kant some philosophers have considered the relationship between aprioricity analyticity and necessity to be extremely close according to jerry fodor positivism in particular took it for granted that a priori truths must be necessary however since kant the distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions had slightly changed analytic propositions were largely taken to be true by virtue of meanings and independently of fact while synthetic propositions were not—one must conduct some sort of empirical investigation looking to the world to determine the truth-value of synthetic propositions
aprioricity analyticity and necessity have since been more clearly separated from each other the american philosopher saul kripke 1972 for example provided strong arguments against this position kripke argued that there are necessary a posteriori truths such as the proposition that water is h2o if it is true according to kripke this statement is necessarily true since water and h2o are the same thing they are identical in every possible world and truths of identity are logically necessary and a posteriori since it is known only through empirical investigation following such considerations of kripke and others such as hilary putnam philosophers tend to distinguish more clearly the notion of aprioricity from that of necessity and analyticity
kripkes definitions of these terms however diverge in subtle ways from those of kant taking these differences into account kripkes controversial analysis of naming as contingent and a priori would best fit into kants epistemological framework by calling it analytic a posteriori
thus the relationship between aprioricity necessity and analyticity is not easy to discern however most philosophers at least seem to agree that while the various distinctions may overlap the notions are clearly not identical the a prioria posteriori distinction is epistemological the analyticsynthetic distinction is linguistic and the necessarycontingent distinction is metaphysical


 history 


 early uses 
the phrases a priori and a posteriori are latin for from what comes before and from what comes later or less literally from first principles before experience and after experience they appear in latin translations of euclids elements of about 300 bc a work widely considered during the early european modern period as the model for precise thinking
an early philosophical use of what might be considered a notion of a priori knowledge though not called by that name is platos theory of recollection related in the dialogue meno 380 bc according to which something like a priori knowledge is knowledge inherent intrinsic in the human mind
albert of saxony a 14th-century logician wrote on both a priori and a posteriori george berkeley the irish divine and philosopher outlined the distinction in a treatise concerning the principles of human knowledge of 1710 though the terms were already well known by that time


 immanuel kant 
the 18th-century german philosopher immanuel kant 1781 advocated a blend of rationalist and empiricist theories kant says although all our cognition begins with experience it does not follow that it arises is caused by from experience according to kant a priori cognition is transcendental or based on the form of all possible experience while a posteriori cognition is empirical based on the content of experience kant states … it is quite possible that our empirical knowledge is a compound of that which we receive through impressions and that which the faculty of cognition supplies from itself sensuous impressions sense data giving merely the occasion opportunity for a cause to produce its effect contrary to contemporary usages of the term kant thinks that a priori knowledge is not entirely independent of the content of experience and unlike the rationalists kant thinks that a priori cognition in its pure form that is without the admixture of any empirical content is limited to the deduction of the conditions of possible experience these a priori or transcendental conditions are seated in ones cognitive faculties and are not provided by experience in general or any experience in particular although an argument exists that a priori intuitions can be triggered by experience
kant nominated and explored the possibility of a transcendental logic with which to consider the deduction of the a priori in its pure form space time and causality are considered pure a priori intuitions kant reasoned that the pure a priori intuitions are established via his transcendental aesthetic and transcendental logic he claimed that the human subject would not have the kind of experience that it has were these a priori forms not in some way constitutive of him as a human subject for instance a person would not experience the world as an orderly rule-governed place unless time space and causality were determinant functions in the form of perceptual faculties i e there can be no experience in general without space time or causality as particular determinants thereon the claim is more formally known as kants transcendental deduction and it is the central argument of his major work the critique of pure reason the transcendental deduction argues that time space and causality are ideal as much as real in consideration of a possible logic of the a priori this most famous of kants deductions has made the successful attempt in the case for the fact of subjectivity what constitutes subjectivity and what relation it holds with objectivity and the empirical


 johann fichte 
after kants death a number of philosophers saw themselves as correcting and expanding his philosophy leading to the various forms of german idealism one of these philosophers was johann fichte his student and critic arthur schopenhauer accused him of rejecting the distinction between a priori and a posteriori knowledge

 fichte who because the thing-in-itself had just been discredited at once prepared a system without any thing-in-itself consequently he rejected the assumption of anything that was not through and through merely our representation and therefore let the knowing subject be all in all or at any rate produce everything from its own resources for this purpose he at once did away with the essential and most meritorious part of the kantian doctrine the distinction between a priori and a posteriori and thus that between the phenomenon and the thing-in-itself for he declared everything to be a priori naturally without any evidence for such a monstrous assertion instead of these he gave sophisms and even crazy sham demonstrations whose absurdity was concealed under the mask of profundity and of the incomprehensibility ostensibly arising therefrom moreover he appealed boldly and openly to intellectual intuition that is really to inspiration
