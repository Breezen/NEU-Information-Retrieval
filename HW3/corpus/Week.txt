a week is a time unit equal to seven days it is the standard time period used for cycles of rest days in most parts of the world mostly alongside—although not strictly part of—the gregorian calendar
the days of the week were named after the classical planets derived from the astrological system of planetary hours in the roman era in english the names are monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday and sunday
iso 8601 includes the iso week date system a numbering system for weeks within a given year – each week begins on a monday and is associated with the year that contains that weeks thursday so that if a year starts in a long weekend friday–sunday week number one of the year will start after that iso 8601 assigns numbers to the days of the week running from 1 to 7 for monday through to sunday
the term week is sometimes expanded to refer to other time units comprising a few days such as the nundinal cycle of the ancient roman calendar or the work week or school week referring only to the days spent on those activities


 name 
the english word week comes from the old english wice ultimately from a common germanic wikōn- from a root wik- turn move change the germanic word probably had a wider meaning prior to the adoption of the roman calendar perhaps succession series as suggested by gothic wikō translating taxis order in luke 18
the seven-day week is named in many languages by a word derived from seven the archaism sennight seven-night preserves the old germanic practice of reckoning time by nights as in the more common fortnight fourteen-night hebdomad and hebdomadal week both derive from the greek hebdomás ἑβδομάσ a seven the obsolete septimane is cognate with the romance terms derived from latin septimana a seven
slavic has a formation tъžьdьnь serbo-croatian тједан ukrainian тиждень czech týden polish tydzień from tъ this  dьnь day in some cases alongside nedělja ocs нєдѣлꙗ a loan-translation of latin feria and sedmitsa седмица as ἑβδομάσ derived from seven chinese has 星期 as it were planetary time unit


 definition and duration 
a week is defined as an interval of exactly seven days so that technically except at daylight saving time transitions or leap seconds
1 week  7 days  168 hours  10,080 minutes  604,800 seconds
with respect to the gregorian calendar
1 gregorian calendar year  52 weeks  1 day 2 days in a leap year
1 week  ​1600⁄6957 ≈ 22.9984% of an average gregorian month
in a gregorian mean year there are 365.2425 days and thus exactly ​52 71⁄400 or 52.1775 weeks unlike the julian year of 365.25 days or ​52 5⁄28 ≈ 52.1786 weeks which cannot be represented by a finite decimal expansion there are exactly 20,871 weeks in 400 gregorian years so 17 march 1618 was a saturday just like 17 march 2018
relative to the path of the moon a week is 23.659% of an average lunation or 94.637% of an average quarter lunation
historically the system of dominical letters letters a to g identifying the weekday of the first day of a given year has been used to facilitate calculation of the day of week the day of the week can be easily calculated given a dates julian day number jd ie the integer value at noon ut adding one to the remainder after dividing the julian day number by seven jd modulo 7  1 yields that dates iso 8601 day of the week for example the julian day number of 17 march 2018 is 2458195 calculating 2458195 mod 7  1 yields 6 corresponding to saturday


 days of the week 

the days of the week were originally named for the classical planets this naming system persisted alongside an ecclesiastical tradition of numbering the days in ecclesiastical latin beginning with dominica the day of the lord as the first day the greco-roman gods associated with the classical planets were rendered in their interpretatio germanica at some point during the late roman empire yielding the germanic tradition of names based on indigenous deities
the ordering of the weekday names is not the classical order of the planets by distance in the planetary spheres model or equivalently by their apparent speed of movement in the night sky instead the planetary hours systems resulted in succeeding days being named for planets that are three places apart in their traditional listing this characteristic was apparently discussed in plutarch in a treatise written in c ad 100 which is reported to have addressed the question of why are the days named after the planets reckoned in a different order from the actual order the text of plutarchs treatise has been lost
an ecclesiastical non-astrological system of numbering the days of the week was adopted in late antiquity this model also seems to have influenced presumably via gothic the designation of wednesday as mid-week in old high german mittawehha and old church slavonic срѣда old church slavonic may have also modeled the name of monday понєдѣльникъ after the latin feria secunda the ecclesiastical system became prevalent in eastern christianity but in the latin west it remains extant only in modern icelandic galician and portuguese


 history 
a continuous seven-day cycle that runs throughout history paying no attention whatsoever to the phases of the moon was probably first practiced in judaism dated to the 6th century bc at the latest
there are several hypotheses concerning the origin of the biblical seven-day cycle
friedrich delitzsch and others suggested that the seven-day week being approximately a quarter of a lunation is the implicit astronomical origin of the seven-day week  and indeed the babylonian calendar used intercalary days to synchronize the last week of a month with the new moon according to this theory the jewish week was adopted from the babylonians while removing the moon-dependency
however niels-erik andreasen jeffrey h tigay and others claimed that the sabbath is mentioned as a day of rest in some of the earliest layers of the pentateuch dated to the 9th century bc at the latest centuries before judeas babylonian exile they also find the resemblance between the biblical sabbath and the babylonian system weak therefore they suggested that the seven-day week may reflect an independent israelite tradition tigay writes

it is clear that among neighboring nations that were in position to have an influence over israel - and in fact which did influence it in various matters - there is no precise parallel to the israelite sabbatical week this leads to the conclusion that the sabbatical week which is as unique to israel as the sabbath from which it flows is an independent israelite creation

the seven-day week seems to have been adopted at different stages by the persian empire in hellenistic astrology and via greek transmission in gupta india and tang china
the babylonian system was received by the greeks in the 4th century bc notably via eudoxus of cnidus however the designation of the seven days of the week to the seven planets is an innovation introduced in the time of augustus the astrological concept of planetary hours is rather an original innovation of hellenistic astrology probably first conceived in the 2nd century bc
the seven day week was widely known throughout the roman empire by the 1st century ad along with references to the jewish sabbath by roman scholars such as seneca and ovid the seven day cycle ultimately replaced the older roman system of the nundinal cycle probably during the 4th century


 ancient near east 
the earliest evidence of an astrological significance of a seven-day period is connected to gudea priest-king of lagash in sumer during the gutian dynasty who built a seven-room temple which he dedicated with a seven-day festival in the flood story of the assyro-babylonian epic of gilgamesh the storm lasts for seven days the dove is sent out after seven days and the noah-like character of utnapishtim leaves the ark seven days after it reaches firm ground
it seems likely that the hebrew seven-day week is based on the babylonian tradition although going through certain adaptations george aaron barton speculated that the seven-day creation account of genesis is connected to the babylonian creation epic enûma eliš which is recorded on seven tablets 
counting from the new moon the babylonians celebrated the 7th 14th 21st and 28th as holy-days also called evil days meaning unsuitable for prohibited activities on these days officials were prohibited from various activities and common men were forbidden to make a wish and at least the 28th was known as a rest-day on each of them offerings were made to a different god and goddess
in a frequently-quoted suggestion going back to the early 20th century the hebrew sabbath is compared to the sumerian sa-bat mid-rest a term for the full moon the sumerian term has been reconstructed as rendered sapattum or sabattum in babylonian possibly present in the lost fifth tablet of the enûma eliš tentatively reconstructed  sabbath shalt thou then encounter midmonthly


 achaemenid period 
the zoroastrian calendar follows the babylonian in relating the seventh and other days of the month to ahura mazda the forerunner of all modern zoroastrian calendars is the system used to reckon dates in the persian empire adopted from the babylonian calendar by the 4th century bc
frank c senn in his book christian liturgy catholic and evangelical points to data suggesting evidence of an early continuous use of a seven-day week referring to the jews during the babylonian captivity in the 6th century bc after the destruction of the temple of solomon while the seven-day week in judaism is tied to creation account in the book of genesis in the hebrew bible where god creates the heavens and the earth in six days and rests on the seventh genesis 11–23 in the book of exodus the fourth of the ten commandments is to rest on the seventh day shabbat which can be seen as implying a socially instituted seven-day week it is not clear whether the genesis narrative predates the babylonian captivity of the jews in the 6th century bc at least since the second temple period under persian rule judaism relied on the seven-day cycle of recurring sabbaths
tablets from the achaemenid period indicate that the lunation of 29 or 30 days basically contained three seven-day weeks and a final week of eight or nine days inclusive breaking the continuous seven-day cycle the babylonians additionally celebrated the 19th as a special evil day the day of anger because it was roughly the 49th day of the preceding month completing a week of weeks also with sacrifices and prohibitions
difficulties with friedrich delitzschs origin theory connecting hebrew shabbat with the babylonian lunar cycle include reconciling the differences between an unbroken week and a lunar week and explaining the absence of texts naming the lunar week as shabbat in any language


 hellenistic and roman era 

in jewish sources by the time of the septuagint the term sabbath greek sabbaton by synecdoche also came to refer to an entire seven-day week the interval between two weekly sabbaths jesuss parable of the pharisee and the publican luke 1812 describes the pharisee as fasting twice in the week greek δὶσ τοῦ σαββάτου dis tou sabbatou
the ancient romans traditionally used the eight-day nundinum but after the julian calendar had come into effect in 45 bc the seven-day week came into increasing use for a while the week and the nundinal cycle coexisted but by the time the week was officially adopted by constantine in ad 321 the nundinal cycle had fallen out of use the association of the days of the week with the sun the moon and the five planets visible to the naked eye dates to the roman era 2nd century 
the continuous seven-day cycle of the days of the week can be traced back to the reign of augustus the first identifiable date cited complete with day of the week is 6 february ad 60 identified as a sunday as viii idus februarius dies solis eighth day before the ides of february day of the sun in a pompeiian graffito according to the currently-used julian calendar 6 february 60 was however a wednesday this is explained by the existence of two conventions of naming days of the weeks based on the planetary hours system 6 february was a sunday based on the sunset naming convention and a wednesday based on the sunrise naming convention


 adoption in asia 


 china 
the earliest known reference in chinese writings to a seven-day week is attributed to fan ning who lived in the late 4th century in the jin dynasty while diffusions from the manichaeans are documented with the writings of the chinese buddhist monk yi jing and the ceylonese or central asian buddhist monk bu kong of the 7th century tang dynasty
the chinese variant of the planetary system was brought to japan by the japanese monk kobo daishi 9th century surviving diaries of the japanese statesman fujiwara michinaga show the seven-day system in use in heian japan as early as 1007 in japan the seven-day system was kept in use for astrological purposes until its promotion to a full-fledged western-style calendrical basis during the meiji era


 india 
the seven-day week was known in india by the 6th century referenced in the pañcasiddhāntikā shashi 2000 mentions the garga samhita which he places in the 1st century bc or ad as a possible earlier reference to a seven-day week in india he concludes the above references furnish a terminus ad quem viz 1st century the terminus a quo cannot be stated with certainty


 christian europe 

the seven-day weekly cycle has remained unbroken in christendom and hence in western history for almost two millennia despite changes to the coptic julian and gregorian calendars demonstrated by the date of easter sunday having been traced back through numerous computistic tables to an ethiopic copy of an early alexandrian table beginning with the easter of ad 311
a tradition of divinations arranged for the days of the week on which certain feast days occur develops in the early medieval period there are many later variants of this including the german bauern-praktik and the versions of erra pater published in 16th to 17th century england mocked in samuel butlers hudibras south and east slavic versions are known as koliadniki from koliada a loan of latin calendae with bulgarian copies dating from the 13th century and serbian versions from the 14th century medieval christian traditions associated with the lucky or unlucky nature of certain days of the week survived into the modern period this concerns primarily friday associated with the crucifixion of jesus sunday sometimes personified as saint anastasia was itself an object of worship in russia a practice denounced in a sermon extant in copies going back to the 14th century
sunday in the ecclesiastical numbering system also counted as the feria prima or the first day of the week yet at the same time figures as the eighth day and has occasionally been so called in christian liturgy 
justin martyr wrote the first day after the sabbath remaining the first of all the days is called however the eighth according to the number of all the days of the cycle and yet remains the first
a period of eight days starting and ending on a sunday is called an octave particularly in roman catholic liturgy in german the phrase in acht tagen literally in eight days means one week from today


 week numbering 

weeks in a gregorian calendar year can be numbered for each year this style of numbering is commonly used for example by schools and businesses in some european and asian countries but rare elsewhere
iso 8601 includes the iso week date system a numbering system for weeks – each week begins on a monday and is associated with the year that contains that weeks thursday so that if a year starts in a long weekend friday–sunday week number one of the year will start after that for example week 1 of 2004 2004w01 ran from monday 29 december 2003 to sunday 4 january 2004 because its thursday was 1 january 2004 whereas week 1 of 2005 2005w01 ran from monday 3 january 2005 to sunday 9 january 2005 because its thursday was 6 january 2005 and so the first thursday of 2005 the highest week number in a year is either 52 or 53 it was 53 in the year 2004 schematically this iso convention translates as follows
in some countries though the numbering system is different from the iso standard at least six numberings are in use
the semiconductor package date code is often a 4 digit date code yyww where the first two digits yy are the last 2 digits of the calendar year and the last two digits ww are the two-digit week number
the tire date code mandated by the us dot is a 4 digit date code wwyy with two digits of the week number ww followed by the last two digits of the calendar year yy


 weeks in other calendars 
the term week is sometimes expanded to refer to other time units comprising a few days such weeks of between four and ten days have been used historically in various places intervals longer than 10 days are not usually termed weeks as they are closer in length to the fortnight or the month than to the seven-day week


 pre-modern calendars 
calendars unrelated to the chaldean hellenistic christian or jewish traditions often have time cycles between the day and the month of varying lengths sometimes also called weeks
an eight-day week was used in ancient rome and possibly in the pre-christian celtic calendar traces of a nine-day week are found in baltic languages and in welsh the ancient chinese calendar had a ten-day week as did the ancient egyptian calendar and incidentally the french republican calendar dividing its 30-day months into thirds
a six-day week is found in the akan calendar several cultures used a five-day week including the 10th century icelandic calendar the javanese calendar and the traditional cycle of market days in korea the igbo have a market week of four days evidence of a three-day week has been derived from the names of the days of the week in guipuscoan basque
the aztecs and mayas used the mesoamerican calendars the most important of these calendars divided a ritual cycle of 260 days known as tonalpohualli in nahuatl and tzolkin in yucatec maya into 20 weeks of 13 days known in spanish as trecenas they also divided the solar year into 18 periods of 20 days and five nameless days creating a 20-day month divided into four five-day weeks the end of each five-day week was a market day
the balinese pawukon is a 210-day calendar consisting of 10 different simultaneously running weeks of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 days of which the weeks of 4 8 and 9 days are interrupted to fit into the 210-day cycle


 modern calendar reforms 

a 10-day week called décade was used in france for nine and a half years from october 1793 to april 1802 furthermore the paris commune adopted the revolutionary calendar for 18 days in 1871
the baháí calendar features a 19-day period which some classify as a month and others classify as a week
the international fixed calendar also known as the eastman plan fixed every date always on the same weekday this plan kept a 7-day week while defining a year of 13 months with 28 days each it was the official calendar of the eastman kodak company for decades

between 1929 and 1931 the ussr changed from the seven-day week to a five-day week there were 72 weeks and an additional five national holidays inserted within three of them totaling a year of 365 days in 1931 after its brief experiment with a five-day week the soviet union changed to a six-day week every sixth day 6th 12th 18th 24th and 30th of the gregorian calendar was a state rest day the five additional national holidays in the earlier five-day week remained and did not fall on the state rest day but as january march may july august october and december have 31 days the week after the state rest day of the 30th was seven days long 31st–7th this extra day was a working day for most or an extra holiday for others also as february is only 28 or 29 days depending on whether it is a leap year or not the first of march was also made a state rest day although not every enterprise conformed to this to clarify the week after the state rest day 24/25 february to 1 march was only five or six days long depending on whether it was a leap year or not the week after that 2 to 6 march was only five days long the calendar was abandoned 26 june 1940 and the seven-day week reintroduced the next day
