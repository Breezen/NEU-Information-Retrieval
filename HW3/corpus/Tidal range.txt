the tidal range is the vertical difference between the high tide and the succeeding low tide
tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted by the moon and the sun and the rotation of the earth the tidal range is not constant but changes depending on the locations of the sun and the moon
the most extreme tidal range occurs during spring tides when the gravitational forces of both the sun and moon are aligned syzygy reinforcing each other in the same direction new moon or in opposite directions full moon during neap tides when the moon and suns gravitational force vectors act in quadrature making a right angle to the earths orbit the difference between high and low tides is smaller neap tides occur during the first and last quarters of the moons phases the largest annual tidal range can be expected around the time of the equinox if coincidental with a spring tide
tidal data for coastal areas is published by the national hydrographic service of the country concerned tidal data is based on astronomical phenomena and is predictable storm force winds blowing from a steady direction for a prolonged time interval combined with low barometric pressure can increase the tidal range particularly in narrow bays such weather-related effects on the tide which can cause ranges in excess of predicted values and can cause localized flooding are not calculable in advance


 geography 
the typical tidal range in the open ocean is about 0.6 metres 2 feet closer to the coast this range is much greater coastal tidal ranges vary globally and can differ anywhere from near zero to over 11 metres 38 feet the exact range depends on the volume of water adjacent to the coast and the geography of the basin the water sits in larger bodies of water have higher ranges and the geography can act as a funnel amplifying or dispersing the tide the worlds largest tidal range of 16.3 metres 53.5 feet occurs in bay of fundy canada and the united kingdom regularly experiences tidal ranges up to 15 metres between england and wales in the severn estuary the top 50 locations with the largest tidal ranges worldwide are listed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration of the united states
some of the smallest tidal ranges occur in the mediterranean baltic and caribbean seas a point within a tidal system where the tidal range is almost zero is called an amphidromic point


 classification 
the tidal range has been classified as
micromareal when the tidal range is lower than 2 metres
mesomareal when the tidal range is between 2 metres and 4 metres
macromareal when the tidal range is higher than 4 metres
