the analytic–synthetic distinction also called the analytic–synthetic dichotomy is a semantic distinction used primarily in philosophy to distinguish propositions in particular statements that are affirmative subject–predicate judgments into two types analytic propositions and synthetic propositions analytic propositions are true by virtue of their meaning while synthetic propositions are true by how their meaning relates to the world however philosophers have used the terms in very different ways furthermore philosophers have debated whether there is a legitimate distinction


 kant 


 conceptual containment 
the philosopher immanuel kant uses the terms analytic and synthetic to divide propositions into two types kant introduces the analytic–synthetic distinction in the introduction to his critique of pure reason 1781/1998 a6–7b10–11 there he restricts his attention to statements that are affirmative subject-predicate judgments and defines analytic proposition and synthetic proposition as follows
analytic proposition a proposition whose predicate concept is contained in its subject concept
synthetic proposition a proposition whose predicate concept is not contained in its subject concept but related
examples of analytic propositions on kants definition include
all bachelors are unmarried
all triangles have three sides
kants own example is
all bodies are extended that is occupy space a7b11
each of these statements is an affirmative subject-predicate judgment and in each the predicate concept is contained within the subject concept the concept bachelor contains the concept unmarried the concept unmarried is part of the definition of the concept bachelor likewise for triangle and has three sides and so on
examples of synthetic propositions on kants definition include
all bachelors are alone
all creatures with hearts have kidneys
kants own example is
all bodies are heavy that is have mass a7b11
as with the previous examples classified as analytic propositions each of these new statements is an affirmative subject–predicate judgment however in none of these cases does the subject concept contain the predicate concept the concept bachelor does not contain the concept alone alone is not a part of the definition of bachelor the same is true for creatures with hearts and have kidneys even if every creature with a heart also has kidneys the concept creature with a heart does not contain the concept has kidneys


 kants version and the a priori  a posteriori distinction 

in the introduction to the critique of pure reason kant contrasts his distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions with another distinction the distinction between a priori and a posteriori propositions he defines these terms as follows
a priori proposition a proposition whose justification does not rely upon experience moreover the proposition can be validated by experience but is not grounded in experience therefore it is logically necessary
a posteriori proposition a proposition whose justification does rely upon experience the proposition is validated by and grounded in experience therefore it is logically contingent
examples of a priori propositions include
all bachelors are unmarried
7  5  12
the justification of these propositions does not depend upon experience one need not consult experience to determine whether all bachelors are unmarried nor whether 7  5  12 of course as kant would grant experience is required to understand the concepts bachelor unmarried 7  and so forth however the a priori  a posteriori distinction as employed here by kant refers not to the origins of the concepts but to the justification of the propositions once we have the concepts experience is no longer necessary
examples of a posteriori propositions include
all bachelors are unhappy
tables exist
both of these propositions are a posteriori any justification of them would require ones experience
the analyticsynthetic distinction and the a priori  a posteriori distinction together yield four types of propositions
analytic a priori
synthetic a priori
analytic a posteriori
synthetic a posteriori
kant posits the third type as obviously self-contradictory ruling it out he discusses only the remaining three types as components of his epistemological framework—each for brevitys sake becoming respectively analytic synthetic a priori and empirical or a posteriori propositions this triad will account for all propositions possible


 the ease of knowing analytic propositions 
part of kants argument in the introduction to the critique of pure reason involves arguing that there is no problem figuring out how knowledge of analytic propositions is possible to know an analytic proposition kant argued one need not consult experience instead one needs merely to take the subject and extract from it in accordance with the principle of contradiction the required predicate a7b12 in analytic propositions the predicate concept is contained in the subject concept thus to know an analytic proposition is true one need merely examine the concept of the subject if one finds the predicate contained in the subject the judgment is true
thus for example one need not consult experience to determine whether all bachelors are unmarried is true one need merely examine the subject concept bachelors and see if the predicate concept unmarried is contained in it and in fact it is unmarried is part of the definition of bachelor and so is contained within it thus the proposition all bachelors are unmarried can be known to be true without consulting experience
it follows from this kant argued first all analytic propositions are a priori there are no a posteriori analytic propositions it follows second there is no problem understanding how we can know analytic propositions we can know them because we only need to consult our concepts in order to determine that they are true


 the possibility of metaphysics 
after ruling out the possibility of analytic a posteriori propositions and explaining how we can obtain knowledge of analytic a priori propositions kant also explains how we can obtain knowledge of synthetic a posteriori propositions that leaves only the question of how knowledge of synthetic a priori propositions is possible this question is exceedingly important kant maintains because all important metaphysical knowledge is of synthetic a priori propositions if it is impossible to determine which synthetic a priori propositions are true he argues then metaphysics as a discipline is impossible the remainder of the critique of pure reason is devoted to examining whether and how knowledge of synthetic a priori propositions is possible


 logical positivists 


 frege and carnap revise the kantian definition 
over a hundred years later a group of philosophers took interest in kant and his distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions the logical positivists
part of kants examination of the possibility of synthetic a priori knowledge involved the examination of mathematical propositions such as
7  5  12 b15–16
the shortest distance between two points is a straight line b16–17
kant maintained that mathematical propositions such as these are synthetic a priori propositions and that we know them that they are synthetic he thought is obvious the concept equal to 12 is not contained within the concept 7  5 and the concept straight line is not contained within the concept the shortest distance between two points from this kant concluded that we have knowledge of synthetic a priori propositions
gottlob freges notion of analyticity included a number of logical properties and relations beyond containment symmetry transitivity antonymy or negation and so on he had a strong emphasis on formality in particular formal definition and also emphasized the idea of substitution of synonymous terms all bachelors are unmarried can be expanded out with the formal definition of bachelor as unmarried man to form all unmarried men are unmarried which is recognizable as tautologous and therefore analytic from its logical form any statement of the form all x that are f and g are f using this particular expanded idea of analyticity frege concluded that kants examples of arithmetical truths are analytical a priori truths and not synthetic a priori truths

thanks to freges logical semantics particularly his concept of analyticity arithmetic truths like 7512 are no longer synthetic a priori but analytical a priori truths in carnaps extended sense of analytic
hence logical empiricists are not subject to kants criticism of hume for throwing out mathematics along with metaphysics

here logical empiricist is a synonym for logical positivist


 the origin of the logical positivists distinction 
the logical positivists agreed with kant that we have knowledge of mathematical truths and further that mathematical propositions are a priori however they did not believe that any complex metaphysics such as the type kant supplied are necessary to explain our knowledge of mathematical truths instead the logical positivists maintained that our knowledge of judgments like all bachelors are unmarried and our knowledge of mathematics and logic are in the basic sense the same all proceeded from our knowledge of the meanings of terms or the conventions of language

since empiricism had always asserted that all knowledge is based on experience this assertion had to include knowledge in mathematics on the other hand we believed that with respect to this problem the rationalists had been right in rejecting the old empiricist view that the truth of 224 is contingent on the observation of facts a view that would lead to the unacceptable consequence that an arithmetical statement might possibly be refuted tomorrow by new experiences our solution based upon wittgensteins conception consisted in asserting the thesis of empiricism only for factual truth by contrast the truths of logic and mathematics are not in need of confirmation by observations because they do not state anything about the world of facts they hold for any possible combination of facts


 logical positivist definitions 
thus the logical positivists drew a new distinction and inheriting the terms from kant named it the analyticsynthetic distinction they provided many different definitions such as the following
analytic proposition a proposition whose truth depends solely on the meaning of its terms
analytic proposition a proposition that is true or false by definition
analytic proposition a proposition that is made true or false solely by the conventions of language
while the logical positivists believed that the only necessarily true propositions were analytic they did not define analytic proposition as necessarily true proposition or proposition that is true in all possible worlds
synthetic propositions were then defined as
synthetic proposition a proposition that is not analytic
these definitions applied to all propositions regardless of whether they were of subject–predicate form thus under these definitions the proposition it is raining or it is not raining was classified as analytic while for kant it was analytic by virtue of its logical form and the proposition 7  5  12 was classified as analytic while under kants definitions it was synthetic


 two-dimensionalism 
two-dimensionalism is an approach to semantics in analytic philosophy it is a theory of how to determine the sense and reference of a word and the truth-value of a sentence it is intended to resolve a puzzle that has plagued philosophy for some time namely how is it possible to discover empirically that a necessary truth is true two-dimensionalism provides an analysis of the semantics of words and sentences that makes sense of this possibility the theory was first developed by robert stalnaker but it has been advocated by numerous philosophers since including david chalmers and berit brogaard
any given sentence for example the words
water is h2o
is taken to express two distinct propositions often referred to as a primary intension and a secondary intension which together compose its meaning
the primary intension of a word or sentence is its sense ie is the idea or method by which we find its referent the primary intension of water might be a description such as watery stuff the thing picked out by the primary intension of water could have been otherwise for example on some other world where the inhabitants take water to mean watery stuff but where the chemical make-up of watery stuff is not h2o it is not the case that water is h2o for that world
the secondary intension of water is whatever thing water happens to pick out in this world whatever that world happens to be so if we assign water the primary intension watery stuff then the secondary intension of water is h2o since h2o is watery stuff in this world the secondary intension of water in our world is h2o which is h2o in every world because unlike watery stuff it is impossible for h2o to be other than h2o when considered according to its secondary intension water is h2o is true in every world
if two-dimensionalism is workable it solves some very important problems in the philosophy of language saul kripke has argued that water is h2o is an example of the necessary a posteriori since we had to discover that water was h2o but given that it is true it cannot be false it would be absurd to claim that something that is water is not h2o for these are known to be identical


 quines criticisms 

rudolf carnap was a strong proponent of the distinction between what he called internal questions questions entertained within a framework like a mathematical theory and external questions questions posed outside any framework – posed before the adoption of any framework the internal questions could be of two types logical or analytic or logically true and factual empirical that is matters of observation interpreted using terms from a framework the external questions were also of two types those that were confused pseudo-questions one disguised in the form of a theoretical question and those that could be re-interpreted as practical pragmatic questions about whether a framework under consideration was more or less expedient fruitful conducive to the aim for which the language is intended the adjective synthetic was not used by carnap in his 1950 work empiricism semantics and ontology carnap did define a synthetic truth in his work meaning and necessity a sentence that is true but not simply because the semantical rules of the system suffice for establishing its truth
the notion of a synthetic truth is of something that is true both because of what it means and because of the way the world is whereas analytic truths are true in virtue of meaning alone thus what carnap calls internal factual statements as opposed to internal logical statements could be taken as being also synthetic truths because they require observations but some external statements also could be synthetic statements and carnap would be doubtful about their status the analytic–synthetic argument therefore is not identical with the internal–external distinction
in 1951 willard van orman quine published the essay two dogmas of empiricism in which he argued that the analytic–synthetic distinction is untenable the argument at bottom is that there are no analytic truths but all truths involve an empirical aspect in the first paragraph quine takes the distinction to be the following
analytic propositions – propositions grounded in meanings independent of matters of fact
synthetic propositions – propositions grounded in fact
quines position denying the analytic-synthetic distinction is summarized as follows

it is obvious that truth in general depends on both language and extralinguistic fact  thus one is tempted to suppose in general that the truth of a statement is somehow analyzable into a linguistic component and a factual component given this supposition it next seems reasonable that in some statements the factual component should be null and these are the analytic statements but for all its a priori reasonableness a boundary between analytic and synthetic statements simply has not been drawn that there is such a distinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of empiricists a metaphysical article of faith

to summarize quines argument the notion of an analytic proposition requires a notion of synonymy but establishing synonymy inevitably leads to matters of fact – synthetic propositions thus there is no non-circular and so no tenable way to ground the notion of analytic propositions
while quines rejection of the analytic–synthetic distinction is widely known the precise argument for the rejection and its status is highly debated in contemporary philosophy however some for example boghossian argue that quines rejection of the distinction is still widely accepted among philosophers even if for poor reasons


 responses 
paul grice and p f strawson criticized two dogmas in their 1956 article in defense of a dogma among other things they argue that quines skepticism about synonyms leads to a skepticism about meaning if statements can have meanings then it would make sense to ask what does it mean if it makes sense to ask what does it mean then synonymy can be defined as follows two sentences are synonymous if and only if the true answer of the question what does it mean asked of one of them is the true answer to the same question asked of the other they also draw the conclusion that discussion about correct or incorrect translations would be impossible given quines argument four years after grice and strawson published their paper quines book word and object was released in the book quine presented his theory of indeterminacy of translation
in speech acts john searle argues that from the difficulties encountered in trying to explicate analyticity by appeal to specific criteria it does not follow that the notion itself is void considering the way which we would test any proposed list of criteria which is by comparing their extension to the set of analytic statements it would follow that any explication of what analyticity means presupposes that we already have at our disposal a working notion of analyticity
in two dogmas revisited hilary putnam argues that quine is attacking two different notions

it seems to me there is as gross a distinction between all bachelors are unmarried and there is a book on this table as between any two things in this world or at any rate between any two linguistic expressions in the world

analytic truth defined as a true statement derivable from a tautology by putting synonyms for synonyms is near kants account of analytic truth as a truth whose negation is a contradiction analytic truth defined as a truth confirmed no matter what however is closer to one of the traditional accounts of a priori while the first four sections of quines paper concern analyticity the last two concern a priority putnam considers the argument in the two last sections as independent of the first four and at the same time as putnam criticizes quine he also emphasizes his historical importance as the first top rank philosopher to both reject the notion of a priority and sketch a methodology without it
jerrold katz a one-time associate of noam chomsky countered the arguments of two dogmas directly by trying to define analyticity non-circularly on the syntactical features of sentences
in philosophical analysis in the twentieth century volume 1  the dawn of analysis scott soames has pointed out that quines circularity argument needs two of the logical positivists central theses to be effective
all necessary and all a priori truths are analytic
analyticity is needed to explain and legitimate necessity
it is only when these two theses are accepted that quines argument holds it is not a problem that the notion of necessity is presupposed by the notion of analyticity if necessity can be explained without analyticity according to soames both theses were accepted by most philosophers when quine published two dogmas today however soames holds both statements to be antiquated he says very few philosophers today would accept either of these assertions both of which now seem decidedly antique


 peikoffs criticisms 
philosopher leonard peikoff in his essay the analytic-synthetic dichotomy expands upon ayn rands analysis he posits that

the theory of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy presents men with the following choice if your statement is proved it says nothing about that which exists if it is about existents it cannot be proved if it is demonstrated by logical argument it represents a subjective convention if it asserts a fact logic cannot establish it if you validate it by an appeal to the meanings of your concepts then it is cut off from reality if you validate it by an appeal to your percepts then you cannot be certain of it

to peikoff the critical question is what is included in the meaning of a concept he rejects the idea that some of the characteristics of a concepts referents are excluded from the concept applying rands theory that a concept is a mental integration of similar existents treated as units he argues that concepts stand for and mean the actual existents including all their characteristics not just those used to pick out the referents or define the concept he states

since a concept is an integration of units it has no content or meaning apart from its units the meaning of a concept consists of the units — the existents — which it integrates including all the characteristics of these units the fact that certain characteristics are at a given time unknown to man does not indicate that these characteristics are excluded from the entity — or from the concept

furthermore he argues that there is no valid distinction between necessary and contingent facts and that all truths are learned and validated by the same process the application of logic to perceptual data associated with the analytic-synthetic dichotomy are a cluster of other divisions that objectivism also regards as false and artificial such as logical truth vs factual truth logically possible vs empirically possible and a priori vs the a posteriori
