barry clark barish born january 27 1936 is an american experimental physicist and nobel laureate he is a linde professor of physics emeritus at california institute of technology he is a leading expert on gravitational waves
in 2017 barish was awarded the nobel prize in physics along with rainer weiss and kip thorne for decisive contributions to the ligo detector and the observation of gravitational waves


 birth and education 
barish was born in omaha nebraska the son of lee and harold barish his parents families were jewish immigrants from a part of poland that is now in belarus just after world war ii the family moved to los feliz in los angeles he attended john marshall high school and other schools
he earned a ba degree in physics 1957 and a phd degree in experimental high energy physics 1962 at the university of california berkeley he joined caltech in 1963 as part of a new experimental effort in particle physics using frontier particle accelerators at the national laboratories in 1963–1966 he was a research fellow in 1966–1991 an assistant professor associate professor and professor of physics in 1991–2005 he became linde professor of physics and after that linde professor of physics emeritus in 1984–1996 he was the principal investigator of caltech high energy physics group


 research 
first barishs experiments were performed at fermilab using high-energy neutrino collisions to reveal the quark substructure of the nucleon these experiments were among the first to observe the weak neutral current a linchpin of the electroweak unification theories of glashow salam and weinberg
in the 1980s he directed macro an experiment in a cave in gran sasso italy that searched for exotic particles called magnetic monopoles and also studied penetrating cosmic rays including neutrino measurements that provided important confirmatory evidence that neutrinos have mass and oscillate
in 1991 barish was named the maxine and ronald linde professor of physics at caltech
in the early 1990s he spearheaded gem gammas electrons muons an experiment that would have run at the superconducting super collider which was approved after the former project l lead by samuel ting and barish as chairman of collaboration board was rejected by ssc director roy schwitters barish was gem spokesperson
barish became the principal investigator of the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory ligo in 1994 and director in 1997 he led the effort through the approval of funding by the nsf national science board in 1994 the construction and commissioning of the ligo interferometers in livingston la and hanford wa in 1997 he created the ligo scientific collaboration which now numbers more than 1000 collaborators worldwide to carry out the science
the initial ligo detectors reached design sensitivity and set many limits on astrophysical sources the advanced ligo proposal was developed while barish was director and he has continued to play a leading role in ligo and advanced ligo the first detection of the merger of two 30 solar mass black holes was made on september 14 2015 this represented the first direct detection of gravitational waves since they were predicted by einstein in 1916 and the first ever observation of the merger of a pair of black holes barish delivered the first presentation on this discovery to a scientific audience at cern on feb 11 2016 simultaneously with the public announcement
from 2001 to 2002 barish served as co-chair of the high energy physics advisory panel subpanel that developed a long-range plan for us high energy physics he has chaired the commission of particles and fields and the us liaison committee to the international union of pure and applied physics iupap in 2002 he chaired the nrc board of physics and astronomy neutrino facilities assessment committee report neutrinos and beyond
in 2005-2013 barry barish was director of the global design effort for the international linear collider ilc the ilc is the highest priority future project for particle physics worldwide as it promises to complement the large hadron collider at cern in exploring the tev energy scale this ambitious effort is being uniquely coordinated worldwide representing a major step in international collaborations going from conception to design to implementation for large scale projects in physics


 honors and awards 
in 2002 he received the klopsteg memorial award of the american association of physics teachers barish was honored by the university of bologna 2006 and university of florida  2007 where he received honorary doctorates in 2007 delivered the van vleck lectures at the university of minnesota the university of glasgow honored barish with an honorary degree of science in 2013
barish was honored as a titan of physics in the on the shoulders of giants series at the 2016 world science festival
in 2016 barish received the enrico fermi prize for his fundamental contributions to the formation of the ligo and ligo-virgo scientific collaborations and for his role in addressing challenging technological and scientific aspects whose solution led to the first detection of gravitational waves
barish was a recipient of the 2016 smithsonian magazines american ingenuity award in the physical science category
barish was awarded the 2017 henry draper medal from the national academy of sciences for his visionary and pivotal leadership role scientific guidance and novel instrument design during the development of ligo that were crucial for ligos discovery of gravitational waves from colliding black holes thus directly validating einsteins 100-year-old prediction of gravitational waves and ushering a new field of gravitational wave astronomy
barish was a recipient of the 2017 giuseppe and vanna cocconi prize of the european physical society for his pioneering and leading role in the ligo observatory that led to the direct detection of gravitational waves opening a new window to the universe
barish was a recipient of the 2017 princess of asturias award for his work on gravitational waves jointly with kip thorne and rainer weiss
barish was a recipient of the 2017 fudan-zhongzhi science award for his leadership in the construction and initial operations of ligo the creation of the international ligo scientific collaboration and for the successful conversion of ligo from small science executed by a few research groups into big science that involved large collaborations and major infrastructures which eventually enabled gravitational-wave detection jointly with kip thorne and rainer weiss
in 2017 he won the nobel prize in physics jointly with rainer weiss and kip thorne for decisive contributions to the ligo detector and the observation of gravitational waves
barish has been elected to and held fellowship at the following organizations
the american academy of arts and sciences aaas
the national academy of sciences nas
the national science board nsb
fellow of american physical society aps president 2011
fellow of american association for the advancement of science aaas


 family 
barry barish is married to samoan barish they have two children stephanie barish and kenneth barish professor and chair of physics  astronomy at university of california riverside and three grandchildren milo barish-chamberlin thea chamberlin and ariel barish
