 biography 


 early life and background 

bertrand russell was born on 18 may 1872 at ravenscroft trellech monmouthshire into an influential and liberal family of the british aristocracy his parents viscount and viscountess amberley were radical for their times lord amberley consented to his wifes affair with their childrens tutor the biologist douglas spalding both were early advocates of birth control at a time when this was considered scandalous lord amberley was an atheist and his atheism was evident when he asked the philosopher john stuart mill to act as russells secular godfather mill died the year after russells birth but his writings had a great effect on russells life
his paternal grandfather the earl russell had been asked twice by queen victoria to form a government serving her as prime minister in the 1840s and 1860s the russells had been prominent in england for several centuries before this coming to power and the peerage with the rise of the tudor dynasty see duke of bedford they established themselves as one of the leading british whig families and participated in every great political event from the dissolution of the monasteries in 1536–40 to the glorious revolution in 1688–89 and the great reform act in 1832
lady amberley was the daughter of lord and lady stanley of alderley russell often feared the ridicule of his maternal grandmother one of the campaigners for education of women


 childhood and adolescence 
russell had two siblings brother frank nearly seven years older than bertrand and sister rachel four years older in june 1874 russells mother died of diphtheria followed shortly by rachels death in january 1876 his father died of bronchitis following a long period of depression frank and bertrand were placed in the care of their staunchly victorian paternal grandparents who lived at pembroke lodge in richmond park his grandfather former prime minister earl russell died in 1878 and was remembered by russell as a kindly old man in a wheelchair his grandmother the countess russell née lady frances elliot was the dominant family figure for the rest of russells childhood and youth
the countess was from a scottish presbyterian family and successfully petitioned the court of chancery to set aside a provision in amberleys will requiring the children to be raised as agnostics despite her religious conservatism she held progressive views in other areas accepting darwinism and supporting irish home rule and her influence on bertrand russells outlook on social justice and standing up for principle remained with him throughout his life one could challenge the view that bertrand stood up for his principles based on his own well-known quotation i would never die for my beliefs because i might be wrong her favourite bible verse thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil exodus 232 became his motto the atmosphere at pembroke lodge was one of frequent prayer emotional repression and formality frank reacted to this with open rebellion but the young bertrand learned to hide his feelings
russells adolescence was very lonely and he often contemplated suicide he remarked in his autobiography that his keenest interests were in religion and mathematics and that only his wish to know more mathematics kept him from suicide he was educated at home by a series of tutors when russell was eleven years old his brother frank introduced him to the work of euclid which transformed his life
during these formative years he also discovered the works of percy bysshe shelley in his autobiography he writes i spent all my spare time reading him and learning him by heart knowing no one to whom i could speak of what i thought or felt i used to reflect how wonderful it would have been to know shelley and to wonder whether i should meet any live human being with whom i should feel so much sympathy russell claimed that beginning at age 15 he spent considerable time thinking about the validity of christian religious dogma which he found very unconvincing at this age he came to the conclusion that there is no free will and two years later that there is no life after death finally at the age of 18 after reading mills autobiography he abandoned the first cause argument and became an atheist


 university and first marriage 
russell won a scholarship to read for the mathematical tripos at trinity college cambridge and commenced his studies there in 1890 taking as coach robert rumsey webb he became acquainted with the younger george edward moore and came under the influence of alfred north whitehead who recommended him to the cambridge apostles he quickly distinguished himself in mathematics and philosophy graduating as seventh wrangler in the former in 1893 and becoming a fellow in the latter in 1895
russell first met the american quaker alys pearsall smith when he was 17 years old he became a friend of the pearsall smith family – they knew him primarily as lord john’s grandson and enjoyed showing him off he traveled with them to the continent it was in their company that russell visited the paris exhibition of 1889 and was able to climb the eiffel tower soon after it was completed
he soon fell in love with the puritanical high-minded alys who was a graduate of bryn mawr college near philadelphia and contrary to his grandmothers wishes married her on 13 december 1894 their marriage began to fall apart in 1901 when it occurred to russell while he was cycling that he no longer loved her she asked him if he loved her and he replied that he did not russell also disliked alyss mother finding her controlling and cruel it was to be a hollow shell of a marriage and they finally divorced in 1921 after a lengthy period of separation during this period russell had passionate and often simultaneous affairs with a number of women including lady ottoline morrell and the actress lady constance malleson some have suggested that at this point he had an affair with vivienne haigh-wood the english governess and writer and first wife of t s eliot


 early career 

russell began his published work in 1896 with german social democracy a study in politics that was an early indication of a lifelong interest in political and social theory in 1896 he taught german social democracy at the london school of economics he was a member of the coefficients dining club of social reformers set up in 1902 by the fabian campaigners sidney and beatrice webb
he now started an intensive study of the foundations of mathematics at trinity in 1898 he wrote an essay on the foundations of geometry which discussed the cayley–klein metrics used for non-euclidean geometry he attended the international congress of philosophy in paris in 1900 where he met giuseppe peano and alessandro padoa the italians had responded to georg cantor making a science of set theory they gave russell their literature including the formulario mathematico russell was impressed by the precision of peanos arguments at the congress read the literature upon returning to england and came upon russells paradox in 1903 he published the principles of mathematics a work on foundations of mathematics it advanced a thesis of logicism that mathematics and logic are one and the same
at the age of 29 in february 1901 russell underwent what he called a sort of mystic illumination after witnessing whiteheads wifes acute suffering in an angina attack i found myself filled with semi-mystical feelings about beauty  and with a desire almost as profound as that of the buddha to find some philosophy which should make human life endurable russell would later recall at the end of those five minutes i had become a completely different person
in 1905 he wrote the essay on denoting which was published in the philosophical journal mind russell was elected a fellow of the royal society frs in 1908 the three-volume principia mathematica written with whitehead was published between 1910 and 1913 this along with the earlier the principles of mathematics soon made russell world-famous in his field
in 1910 he became a university of cambridge lecturer at trinity college where he studied he was considered for a fellowship which would give him a vote in the college government and protect him from being fired for his opinions but was passed over because he was anti-clerical essentially because he was agnostic he was approached by the austrian engineering student ludwig wittgenstein who became his phd student russell viewed wittgenstein as a genius and a successor who would continue his work on logic he spent hours dealing with wittgensteins various phobias and his frequent bouts of despair this was often a drain on russells energy but russell continued to be fascinated by him and encouraged his academic development including the publication of wittgensteins tractatus logico-philosophicus in 1922 russell delivered his lectures on logical atomism his version of these ideas in 1918 before the end of world war i wittgenstein was at that time serving in the austrian army and subsequently spent nine months in an italian prisoner of war camp at the end of the conflict


 first world war 
during world war i russell was one of the few people to engage in active pacifist activities and in 1916 because of his lack of a fellowship he was dismissed from trinity college following his conviction under the defence of the realm act 1914 he later described this as an illegitimate means the state used to violate freedom of expression in free thought and official propaganda russell played a significant part in the leeds convention in june 1917 a historic event which saw well over a thousand anti-war socialists gather many being delegates from the independent labour party and the socialist party united in their pacifist beliefs and advocating a peace settlement the international press reported that russell appeared with a number of labour mps including ramsay macdonald and philip snowden as well as former liberal mp and anti-conscription campaigner professor arnold lupton after the event russell told lady ottoline morrell that to my surprise when i got up to speak i was given the greatest ovation that was possible to give anybody
the trinity incident resulted in russell being fined £100 which he refused to pay in hope that he would be sent to prison but his books were sold at auction to raise the money the books were bought by friends he later treasured his copy of the king james bible that was stamped confiscated by cambridge police
a later conviction for publicly lecturing against inviting the us to enter the war on the united kingdoms side resulted in six months imprisonment in brixton prison see bertrand russells views on society in 1918 he later said of his imprisonment

i found prison in many ways quite agreeable i had no engagements no difficult decisions to make no fear of callers no interruptions to my work i read enormously i wrote a book introduction to mathematical philosophy and began the work for analysis of mind

russell was reinstated to trinity in 1919 resigned in 1920 was tarner lecturer 1926 and became a fellow again in 1944 until 1949
in 1924 bertrand again gained press attention when attending a banquet in the house of commons with well-known campaigners including arnold lupton who had been a member of parliament and had also endured imprisonment for passive resistance to military or naval service


 g h hardy on the trinity controversy and russells personal life 
in 1941 g h hardy wrote a 61-page pamphlet titled bertrand russell and trinity – published later as a book by cambridge university press with a foreword by c d broad – in which he gave an authoritative account about russells 1916 dismissal from trinity college explaining that a reconciliation between the college and russell had later taken place and gave details about russells personal life hardy writes that russells dismissal had created a scandal since the vast majority of the fellows of the college opposed the decision the ensuing pressure from the fellows induced the council to reinstate russell in january 1920 it was announced that russell had accepted the reinstatement offer from trinity and would begin lecturing from october in july 1920 russell applied for a one year leave of absence this was approved he spent the year giving lectures in china and japan in january 1921 it was announced by trinity that russell had resigned and his resignation had been accepted this resignation hardy explains was completely voluntary and was not the result of another altercation
the reason for the resignation according to hardy was that russell was going through a tumultuous time in his personal life with a divorce and subsequent remarriage russell contemplated asking trinity for another one-year leave of absence but decided against it since this would have been an unusual application and the situation had the potential to snowball into another controversy although russell did the right thing in hardys opinion the reputation of the college suffered due to russells resignation since the ‘world of learning’ knew about russells altercation with trinity but not that the rift had healed in 1925 russell was asked by the council of trinity college to give the tarner lectures on the philosophy of the sciences these would later be the basis for one of russells best received books according to hardy the analysis of matter published in 1927 in the preface to this pamphlet hardy wrote

i wish to make it plain that russell himself is not responsible directly or indirectly for the writing of the pamphlet  i wrote it without his knowledge and when i sent him the typescript and asked for his permission to print it i suggested that unless it contained misstatement of fact he should make no comment on it he agreed to this  no word has been changed as the result of any suggestion from him


 between the wars 

in august 1920 russell travelled to russia as part of an official delegation sent by the british government to investigate the effects of the russian revolution he wrote a four-part series of articles titled soviet russia—1920 for the us magazine the nation he met vladimir lenin and had an hour-long conversation with him in his autobiography he mentions that he found lenin disappointing sensing an impish cruelty in him and comparing him to an opinionated professor he cruised down the volga on a steamship his experiences destroyed his previous tentative support for the revolution he wrote a book the practice and theory of bolshevism about his experiences on this trip taken with a group of 24 others from the uk all of whom came home thinking well of the régime despite russells attempts to change their minds for example he told them that he heard shots fired in the middle of the night and was sure these were clandestine executions but the others maintained that it was only cars backfiring

russells lover dora black a british author feminist and socialist campaigner visited russia independently at the same time in contrast to his reaction she was enthusiastic about the revolution
the following autumn russell accompanied by dora visited peking as it was then known in the west to lecture on philosophy for a year he went with optimism and hope seeing china as then being on a new path other scholars present in china at the time included john dewey and rabindranath tagore the indian nobel-laureate poet before leaving china russell became gravely ill with pneumonia and incorrect reports of his death were published in the japanese press when the couple visited japan on their return journey dora took on the role of spurning the local press by handing out notices reading mr bertrand russell having died according to the japanese press is unable to give interviews to japanese journalists apparently they found this harsh and reacted resentfully
dora was six months pregnant when the couple returned to england on 26 august 1921 russell arranged a hasty divorce from alys marrying dora six days after the divorce was finalised on 27 september 1921 russells children with dora were john conrad russell 4th earl russell born on 16 november 1921 and katharine jane russell now lady katharine tait born on 29 december 1923 russell supported his family during this time by writing popular books explaining matters of physics ethics and education to the layman
from 1922 to 1927 the russells divided their time between london and cornwall spending summers in porthcurno in the 1922 and 1923 general elections russell stood as a labour party candidate in the chelsea constituency but only on the basis that he knew he was extremely unlikely to be elected in such a safe conservative seat and he was not on either occasion
together with dora russell founded the experimental beacon hill school in 1927 the school was run from a succession of different locations including its original premises at the russells residence telegraph house near harting west sussex on 8 july 1930 dora gave birth to her third child harriet ruth after he left the school in 1932 dora continued it until 1943
on a tour through the us in 1927 russell met barry fox later barry stevens who became a well-known gestalt therapist and writer in later years russell and fox developed an intensive relationship in foxs words  for three years we were very close fox sent her daughter judith to beacon hill school for some time from 1927 to 1932 russell wrote 34 letters to fox
upon the death of his elder brother frank in 1931 russell became the 3rd earl russell
russells marriage to dora grew increasingly tenuous and it reached a breaking point over her having two children with an american journalist griffin barry they separated in 1932 and finally divorced on 18 january 1936 russell married his third wife an oxford undergraduate named patricia peter spence who had been his childrens governess since 1930 russell and peter had one son conrad sebastian robert russell 5th earl russell who became a prominent historian and one of the leading figures in the liberal democrat party
russell returned to the london school of economics to lecture on the science of power in 1937
during the 1930s russell became a close friend and collaborator of v k krishna menon then secretary of the india league the foremost lobby in the united kingdom for indian self-rule


 second world war 
russell opposed rearmament against nazi germany in 1937 he wrote in a personal letter if the germans succeed in sending an invading army to england we should do best to treat them as visitors give them quarters and invite the commander and chief to dine with the prime minister in 1940 he changed his view that avoiding a full-scale world war was more important than defeating hitler he concluded that adolf hitler taking over all of europe would be a permanent threat to democracy in 1943 he adopted a stance toward large-scale warfare war was always a great evil but in some particularly extreme circumstances it may be the lesser of two evils
before world war ii russell taught at the university of chicago later moving on to los angeles to lecture at the ucla department of philosophy he was appointed professor at the city college of new york ccny in 1940 but after a public outcry the appointment was annulled by a court judgment that pronounced him morally unfit to teach at the college due to his opinions especially those relating to sexual morality detailed in marriage and morals 1929 the matter was however taken to the new york supreme court by jean kay who was afraid that her daughter would be harmed by the appointment though her daughter was not a student at ccny many intellectuals led by john dewey protested at his treatment albert einsteins oft-quoted aphorism that great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds originated in his open letter dated 19 march 1940 to morris raphael cohen a professor emeritus at ccny supporting russells appointment dewey and horace m kallen edited a collection of articles on the ccny affair in the bertrand russell case russell soon joined the barnes foundation lecturing to a varied audience on the history of philosophy these lectures formed the basis of a history of western philosophy his relationship with the eccentric albert c barnes soon soured and he returned to the uk in 1944 to rejoin the faculty of trinity college


 later life 
russell participated in many broadcasts over the bbc particularly the brains trust and the third programme on various topical and philosophical subjects by this time russell was world-famous outside academic circles frequently the subject or author of magazine and newspaper articles and was called upon to offer opinions on a wide variety of subjects even mundane ones en route to one of his lectures in trondheim russell was one of 24 survivors among a total of 43 passengers of an aeroplane crash in hommelvik in october 1948 he said he owed his life to smoking since the people who drowned were in the non-smoking part of the plane a history of western philosophy 1945 became a best-seller and provided russell with a steady income for the remainder of his life
in 1942 russell argued in favour of a moderate socialism capable of overcoming its metaphysical principles in an inquiry on dialectical materialism launched by the austrian artist and philosopher wolfgang paalen in his journal dyn saying i think the metaphysics of both hegel and marx plain nonsense – marxs claim to be science is no more justified than mary baker eddys this does not mean that i am opposed to socialism in 1943 russell expressed support for zionism i have come gradually to see that in a dangerous and largely hostile world it is essential to jews to have some country which is theirs some region where they are not suspected aliens some state which embodies what is distinctive in their culture
in a speech in 1948 russell said that if the ussrs aggression continued it would be morally worse to go to war after the ussr possessed an atomic bomb than before it possessed one because if the ussr had no bomb the wests victory would come more swiftly and with fewer casualties than if there were atom bombs on both sides at that time only the united states possessed an atomic bomb and the ussr was pursuing an extremely aggressive policy towards the countries in eastern europe which were being absorbed into the soviet unions sphere of influence many understood russells comments to mean that russell approved of a first strike in a war with the ussr including nigel lawson who was present when russell spoke of such matters others including griffin who obtained a transcript of the speech have argued that he was merely explaining the usefulness of americas atomic arsenal in deterring the ussr from continuing its domination of eastern europe however just after the atomic bombs exploded over hiroshima and nagasaki russell wrote letters and published articles in newspapers from 1945 to 1948 stating clearly that it was morally justified and better to go to war against the ussr using atomic bombs while the united states possessed them and before the ussr did in september 1949 one week after the ussr tested its first a-bomb but before this became known russell wrote that ussr would be unable to develop nuclear weapons because following stalins purges only science based on marxist principles would be practiced in the soviet union after it became known that the ussr carried out its nuclear bomb tests russell declared his position advocating for the total abolition of atomic weapons
in 1948 russell was invited by the bbc to deliver the inaugural reith lectures—what was to become an annual series of lectures still broadcast by the bbc his series of six broadcasts titled authority and the individual explored themes such as the role of individual initiative in the development of a community and the role of state control in a progressive society russell continued to write about philosophy he wrote a foreword to words and things by ernest gellner which was highly critical of the later thought of ludwig wittgenstein and of ordinary language philosophy gilbert ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal mind which caused russell to respond via the times the result was a month-long correspondence in the times between the supporters and detractors of ordinary language philosophy which was only ended when the paper published an editorial critical of both sides but agreeing with the opponents of ordinary language philosophy
in the kings birthday honours of 9 june 1949 russell was awarded the order of merit and the following year he was awarded the nobel prize in literature when he was given the order of merit george vi was affable but slightly embarrassed at decorating a former jailbird saying you have sometimes behaved in a manner that would not do if generally adopted russell merely smiled but afterwards claimed that the reply thats right just like your brother immediately came to mind in 1952 russell was divorced by spence with whom he had been very unhappy conrad russells son by spence did not see his father between the time of the divorce and 1968 at which time his decision to meet his father caused a permanent breach with his mother
russell married his fourth wife edith finch soon after the divorce on 15 december 1952 they had known each other since 1925 and edith had taught english at bryn mawr college near philadelphia sharing a house for 20 years with russells old friend lucy donnelly edith remained with him until his death and by all accounts their marriage was a happy close and loving one russells eldest son john suffered from serious mental illness which was the source of ongoing disputes between russell and his former wife dora
in september 1961 at the age of 89 russell was jailed for seven days in brixton prison for breach of peace after taking part in an anti-nuclear demonstration in london the magistrate offered to exempt him from jail if he pledged himself to good behaviour to which russell replied no i wont
in 1962 russell played a public role in the cuban missile crisis in an exchange of telegrams with soviet leader nikita khrushchev khrushchev assured him that the soviet government would not be reckless russell sent this telegram to president kennedy

your action desperate threat to human survival no conceivable justification civilized man condemns it we will not have mass murder ultimatum means war end this madness

according to historian peter knight after jfks assassination russell prompted by the emerging work of the lawyer mark lane in the us  rallied support from other noteworthy and left-leaning compatriots to form a who killed kennedy committee in june 1964 members of which included michael foot mp caroline benn the publisher victor gollancz the writers john arden and j b priestley and the oxford history professor hugh trevor-roper russell published a highly critical article weeks before the warren commission report was published setting forth 16 questions on the assassination and equating the oswald case with the dreyfus affair of late 19th-century france in which the state wrongly convicted an innocent man russell also criticised the american press for failing to heed any voices critical of the official version


 political causes 

bertrand russell was opposed to war from early on his opposition to world war i being used as grounds for his dismissal from trinity college at cambridge this incident fused two of his most controversial causes as hed failed to be granted fellow status which would have protected him from firing because he was not willing to either pretend to be a devout christian or at least avoid admitting he was agnostic
he later described the resolution of these issues as essential to freedom of thought and expression citing the incident in free thought and official propaganda where he explained that the expression of any idea even the most obviously bad must be protected not only from direct state intervention but also economic leveraging and other means of being silenced

the opinions which are still persecuted strike the majority as so monstrous and immoral that the general principle of toleration cannot be held to apply to them
but this is exactly the same view as that which made possible the tortures of the inquisition

russell spent the 1950s and 1960s engaged in political causes primarily related to nuclear disarmament and opposing the vietnam war the 1955 russell–einstein manifesto was a document calling for nuclear disarmament and was signed by eleven of the most prominent nuclear physicists and intellectuals of the time in 1966–67 russell worked with jean-paul sartre and many other intellectual figures to form the russell vietnam war crimes tribunal to investigate the conduct of the united states in vietnam he wrote a great many letters to world leaders during this period
in 1956 immediately before and during the suez crisis russell expressed his opposition to european imperialism in the middle east he viewed the crisis as another reminder of the pressing need for a more effective mechanism for international governance and to restrict national sovereignty to places such as the suez canal area where general interest is involved at the same time the suez crisis was taking place the world was also captivated by the hungarian revolution and the subsequent crushing of the revolt by intervening soviet forces russell attracted criticism for speaking out fervently against the suez war while ignoring soviet repression in hungary to which he responded that he did not criticise the soviets because there was no need most of the so-called western world was fulminating although he later feigned a lack of concern at the time he was disgusted by the brutal soviet response and on 16 november 1956 he expressed approval for a declaration of support for hungarian scholars which michael polanyi had cabled to the soviet embassy in london twelve days previously shortly after soviet troops had already entered budapest
in november 1957 russell wrote an article addressing us president dwight d eisenhower and soviet premier nikita khrushchev urging a summit to consider the conditions of co-existence khrushchev responded that peace could indeed be served by such a meeting in january 1958 russell elaborated his views in the observer proposing a cessation of all nuclear-weapons production with the uk taking the first step by unilaterally suspending its own nuclear-weapons program if necessary and with germany freed from all alien armed forces and pledged to neutrality in any conflict between east and west us secretary of state john foster dulles replied for eisenhower the exchange of letters was published as the vital letters of russell khrushchev and dulles
russell was asked by the new republic a liberal american magazine to elaborate his views on world peace he urged that all nuclear-weapons testing and constant flights by planes armed with nuclear weapons be halted immediately and negotiations be opened for the destruction of all hydrogen bombs with the number of conventional nuclear devices limited to ensure a balance of power he proposed that germany be reunified and accept the oder-neisse line as its border and that a neutral zone be established in central europe consisting at the minimum of germany poland hungary and czechoslovakia with each of these countries being free of foreign troops and influence and prohibited from forming alliances with countries outside the zone in the middle east russell suggested that the west avoid opposing arab nationalism and proposed the creation of a united nations peacekeeping force to guard israels frontiers to ensure that israel was prevented from committing aggression and protected from it he also suggested western recognition of the peoples republic of china and that it be admitted to the un with a permanent seat on the un security council
he was in contact with lionel rogosin while the latter was filming his anti-war film good times wonderful times in the 1960s he became a hero to many of the youthful members of the new left in early 1963 in particular russell became increasingly vocal in his disapproval of the vietnam war and felt that the us governments policies there were near-genocidal in 1963 he became the inaugural recipient of the jerusalem prize an award for writers concerned with the freedom of the individual in society in 1964 he was one of eleven world figures who issued an appeal to israel and the arab countries to accept an arms embargo and international supervision of nuclear plants and rocket weaponry in october 1965 he tore up his labour party card because he suspected harold wilsons labour government was going to send troops to support the united states in vietnam

 views 


 philosophy 

russell is generally credited with being one of the founders of analytic philosophy he was deeply impressed by gottfried leibniz 1646–1716 and wrote on every major area of philosophy except aesthetics he was particularly prolific in the field of metaphysics the logic and the philosophy of mathematics the philosophy of language ethics and epistemology when brand blanshard asked russell why he did not write on aesthetics russell replied that he did not know anything about it but that is not a very good excuse for my friends tell me it has not deterred me from writing on other subjects
on ethics russell considered himself a utilitarian
for the advancement of science and protection of the right to freedom of expression russell advocated the will to doubt the recognition that all human knowledge is at most a best guess that one should always remember

none of our beliefs are quite true all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error the methods of increasing the degree of truth in our beliefs are well known they consist in hearing all sides trying to ascertain all the relevant facts controlling our own bias by discussion with people who have the opposite bias and cultivating a readiness to discard any hypothesis which has proved inadequate these methods are practised in science and have built up the body of scientific knowledge
every man of science whose outlook is truly scientific is ready to admit that what passes for scientific knowledge at the moment is sure to require correction with the progress of discovery nevertheless it is near enough to the truth to serve for most practical purposes though not for all in science where alone something approximating to genuine knowledge is to be found men’s attitude is tentative and full of doubt


 religion 
russell described himself in 1947 as an agnostic saying therefore in regard to the olympic gods speaking to a purely philosophical audience i would say that i am an agnostic but speaking popularly i think that all of us would say in regard to those gods that we were atheists in regard to the christian god i should i think take exactly the same line for most of his adult life russell maintained religion to be little more than superstition and in spite of any positive effects largely harmful to people he believed that religion and the religious outlook serve to impede knowledge and foster fear and dependency and to be responsible for much of our worlds wars oppression and misery he was a member of the advisory council of the british humanist association and president of cardiff humanists until his death


 society 

political and social activism occupied much of russells time for most of his life russell remained politically active almost to the end of his life writing to and exhorting world leaders and lending his name to various causes
russell argued for a scientific society where war would be abolished population growth would be limited and prosperity would be shared he suggested the establishment of a single supreme world government able to enforce peace claiming that the only thing that will redeem mankind is co-operation
russell was an active supporter of the homosexual law reform society being one of the signatories of a e dysons 1958 letter to the times calling for a change in the law regarding male homosexual practices which were partly legalised in 1967 when russell was still alive
in reflections on my eightieth birthday postscript in his autobiography russell wrote i have lived in the pursuit of a vision both personal and social personal to care for what is noble for what is beautiful for what is gentle to allow moments of insight to give wisdom at more mundane times social to see in imagination the society that is to be created where individuals grow freely and where hate and greed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them these things i believe and the world for all its horrors has left me unshaken
