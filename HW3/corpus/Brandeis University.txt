 history 


 founding 

middlesex university was a medical school located in waltham massachusetts that was at the time the only medical school in the united states that did not impose a quota on jews the founder dr john hall smith died in 1944 smiths will stipulated that the school should go to any group willing to use it to establish a non-sectarian university within two years middlesex university was on the brink of financial collapse the school had not been able to secure accreditation by the american medical association which smith partially attributed to institutional antisemitism in the american medical association and as a result massachusetts had all but shut it down
dr smiths son c ruggles smith was desperate for a way to save something of middlesex university he learned of a new york committee headed by dr israel goldstein that was seeking a campus to establish a jewish-sponsored secular university smith approached goldstein with a proposal to give the middlesex campus and charter to goldsteins committee in the hope that his committee might possess the apparent ability to reestablish the school of medicine on an approved basis while goldstein was concerned about being saddled with a failing medical school he was excited about the opportunity to secure a 100-acre 40-hectare campus not far from new york the premier jewish community in the world and only 9 miles 14 km from boston one of the important jewish population centers goldstein agreed to accept smiths offer proceeding to recruit george alpert a boston lawyer with fundraising experience as national vice president of the united jewish appeal
alpert had worked his way through boston university school of law and co-founded the firm of alpert and alpert alperts firm had a long association with the new york new haven and hartford railroad of which he was to become president from 1956 to 1961 he is best known today as the father of richard alpert baba ram dass he was influential in bostons jewish community his judaism tended to be social rather than spiritual he was involved in assisting children displaced from germany alpert was to be chairman of brandeis from 1946 to 1954 and a trustee from 1946 until his death by february 5 1946 goldstein had recruited albert einstein whose involvement drew national attention to the nascent university einstein believed the university would attract the best young people in all fields satisfying a real need
in march 1946 goldstein said the foundation had raised ten-million dollars that it would use to open the school by the following year the foundation purchased middlesex universitys land and buildings for two-million dollars the charter of this operation was transferred to the foundation along with the campus the founding organization was announced in august and named the albert einstein foundation for higher learning inc the new school would be a jewish-sponsored secular university open to students and faculty of all races and religions

the trustees offered to name the university after einstein in the summer of 1946 but einstein declined and on july 16 1946 the board decided the university would be named after louis brandeis einstein objected to what he thought was excessively expansive promotion and to goldsteins sounding out abram l sachar as a possible president without consulting einstein einstein took great offense at goldsteins having invited cardinal francis spellman to participate in a fundraising event einstein also became alarmed by press announcements that exaggerated the schools success at fundraising
einstein threatened to sever ties with the foundation on september 2 1946 believing the venture could not succeed without einstein goldstein quickly agreed to resign himself and einstein recanted einsteins near-departure was publicly denied goldstein said that despite his resignation he would continue to solicit donations for the foundation on november 1 1946 the foundation announced that the new university would be named brandeis university after louis d brandeis justice of the united states supreme court by the end of 1946 the foundation said it had raised over five hundred thousand dollars and two months later it said it had doubled that amount
brandeis felt it was in no position to make the investment in the medical school that would enable it to receive accreditation and closed it in 1947 einstein wanted middlesex universitys veterinary schools standards to be improved before expanding to the school while others in the foundation wanted to simply close the veterinary school which by the winter of 1947 had an enrollment of just about 100 students a professional study of the veterinary school recommended dismissing certain instructors and requiring end-of-year examinations for the students but the foundation declined to enact any of the recommendations to the dismay of einstein and a couple of the foundations trustees
in early june 1947 einstein made a final break with the foundation the veterinary school was closed despite students protests and demonstrations according to george alpert a lawyer responsible for much of the organizational effort said that einstein had wanted to offer the presidency of the school to left-wing scholar harold laski someone that alpert had characterized as a man utterly alien to american principles of democracy tarred with the communist brush he said i can compromise on any subject but one that one is americanism two of the foundations trustees s ralph lazrus and dr otto nathan quit the foundation at the same time as einstein in response alpert said that lazrus and nathan had tried to give brandeis university a radical political orientation alpert also criticized lazrus lack of fundraising success and nathans failure to organize an educational advisory committee einstein said he lazrus and nathan have always been and have always acted in complete harmony


 opening 

on april 26 1948 brandeis university announced that abram l sachar chairman of the national hillel commission had been chosen as brandeis first president sachar promised that brandeis university would follow louis brandeis principles of academic integrity and service he also promised that students and faculty would never be chosen based on quotas of genetic or ethnic or economic distribution because choices based on quotas are based on the assumption that there are standard population strains on the belief that the ideal american must look and act like an eighteenth-century puritan that the melting pot of america must mold all who all who live here into such a pattern students who applied to the school were not asked their race religion or ancestry
brandeis decided its undergraduate instruction would not be organized with traditional departments or divisions and instead it would have four schools namely the school of general studies the school of social studies the school of humanities and the school of science on october 14 1948 brandeis university received its first freshman class of 107 students they were taught by thirteen instructors in eight buildings on a 100-acre 40-hectare campus students came from 28 states and six foreign countries the library was formerly a barn students slept in the former medical school building and two army barracks and the cafeteria was where the medical school had stored cadavers historians elinor and robert slater later called the opening of brandeis one of the great moments in jewish history

 student takeover of ford hall 
on january 8 1969 about 70 black students entered then-student-center ford hall ejected everyone else from the building and refused to leave the students demands included the hiring of more black faculty members increasing black student enrollment from four percent to ten percent of the student body establishing an independent department on african american studies and an increase in scholarships for black students the student protesters renamed the school malcolm x university for the duration of the siege distributing buttons with the new name and logo and issued a list of fourteen demands for better minority representation on campus the students refused to allow telephone calls go through the switchboard over 200 white students staged a sit-in in the lobby of the administration building classes continued on campus during the protest other campuses that had protests at the same time included san francisco state college the university of minnesota swarthmore college cheyney state college queens college and san jose state college
president morris b abram said that although he recognized the deep frustration and anger which black students here and all over the country—and often is—the indifference and duplicity of white men in relation to blacks the students actions were an affront to the university abram said that nothing less than academic freedom itself is under assault the faculty condemned the students actions as well on the third day of the protest abram proposed creating three committees to spell out in detail those points which still divide us the students rejected the idea
on the fourth day of the protest the middlesex superior court issued a temporary restraining order requiring the students to leave ford hall while abram said he would not allow the order to be enforced by forcibly removing the students from ford hall he did say that 65 students had been suspended for their actions on january 18 the black students exited ford hall ending the eleven-day occupation of the building brandeis and students still were not in agreement on one of the demands namely the establishment of an autonomous department on african american studies brandeis insisted that such a department be subject to the same rules as any other department no violence or destruction of property had taken place during the occupation brandeis gave the students amnesty from their actions ronald walters became the first chair of afro-american studies at brandeis later the same year ford hall was demolished in august 2000 to make way for the shapiro campus center which was opened and dedicated october 3 2002


 21st century 

in 2014 brandeis announced it would offer an honorary doctorate to ayaan hirsi ali a staunch supporter of womens rights and an outspoken campaigner against female genital mutilation honor killing and islamic extremism in general after complaints from the council on american-islamic relations and internal consultation with faculty and students brandeis publicly withdrew the offer citing that alis statements condemning islam were inconsistent with the universitys core values 87 out of 511 faculty members at brandeis signed a letter to the university president
the university announced that the decision to withdraw the invitation was made after a discussion between ayaan ali and president frederick lawrence stating that she is a compelling public figure and advocate for womens rights  but we cannot overlook certain of her past statements according to brandeis ali was never invited to speak at commencement she was only invited to receive an honorary degree ali said that brandeis decision surprised her because brandeis said they did not know what she had said in the past even though her speeches were publicly available on the internet calling it a feeble excuse ali stated that the universitys decision was motivated in part by fear of offending muslims she argued that the spirit of free expression referred to in the brandeis statement has been betrayed and stifled
while some commentators such as abullah antepli the muslim chaplain and adjunct faculty of islamic studies at duke university applauded the decision and warned against making renegades into heroes other academic commentators such as the university of chicagos jerry coyne and the george mason university foundation professor david bernstein criticized the decision as an attack on academic values such as freedom of inquiry and intellectual independence from religious pressure groups
