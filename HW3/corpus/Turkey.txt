 etymology 

the name of turkey turkish türkiye can be divided into two components the ethnonym türk and the abstract suffix –iye meaning owner land of or related to originally derived from the greek and latin suffixes –ia in tourkia τουρκία and turchia the first recorded use of the term türk or türük as an autonym is contained in the old turkic inscriptions of the göktürks celestial turks of central asia c ad 735 the turkic self-designation türk is first attested in reference to the göktürks in the 6th century ad a letter by ishbara qaghan to emperor wen of sui in 585 described him as the great turk khan an early form of the same name may be reflected in the form of tie-le 鐵勒 or tu-jue 突厥 name given by the chinese to the people living south of the altay mountains of central asia as early as 177 bc the greek name tourkia greek τουρκία was used by the byzantine emperor and scholar constantine vii porphyrogenitus in his book de administrando imperio though in his use turks always referred to magyars similarly the medieval khazar empire a turkic state on the northern shores of the black and caspian seas was referred to as tourkia land of the turks in byzantine sources however the byzantines later began using this name to define the seljuk-controlled parts of anatolia in the centuries that followed the battle of manzikert in 1071 the medieval greek and latin terms did not designate the same geographic area now known as turkey instead they were mostly synonymous with tartary a term including khazaria and the other khaganates of the central asian steppe until the appearance of the seljuks and the rise of the ottoman empire in the 14th century reflecting the progress of the turkic expansion


 history 


 prehistory of anatolia and eastern thrace 

the anatolian peninsula comprising most of modern turkey is one of the oldest permanently settled regions in the world various ancient anatolian populations have lived in anatolia from at least the neolithic period until the hellenistic period many of these peoples spoke the anatolian languages a branch of the larger indo-european language family in fact given the antiquity of the indo-european hittite and luwian languages some scholars have proposed anatolia as the hypothetical centre from which the indo-european languages radiated the european part of turkey called eastern thrace has also been inhabited since at least forty thousand years ago and is known to have been in the neolithic era by about 6000 bc
göbekli tepe is the site of the oldest known man-made religious structure a temple dating to circa 10,000 bc while çatalhöyük is a very large neolithic and chalcolithic settlement in southern anatolia which existed from approximately 7500 bc to 5700 bc it is the largest and best-preserved neolithic site found to date and in july 2012 was inscribed as a unesco world heritage site the settlement of troy started in the neolithic age and continued into the iron age
the earliest recorded inhabitants of anatolia were the hattians and hurrians non-indo-european peoples who inhabited central and eastern anatolia respectively as early as ca 2300 bc indo-european hittites came to anatolia and gradually absorbed the hattians and hurrians ca 2000–1700 bc the first major empire in the area was founded by the hittites from the 18th through the 13th century bc the assyrians conquered and settled parts of southeastern turkey as early as 1950 bc until the year 612 bc urartu re-emerged in assyrian inscriptions in the 9th century bc as a powerful northern rival of assyria following the collapse of the hittite empire c 1180 bc the phrygians an indo-european people achieved ascendancy in anatolia until their kingdom was destroyed by the cimmerians in the 7th century bc starting from 714 bc urartu shared the same fate and dissolved in 590 bc when it was conquered by the medes the most powerful of phrygias successor states were lydia caria and lycia


 antiquity 

starting around 1200 bc the coast of anatolia was heavily settled by aeolian and ionian greeks numerous important cities were founded by these colonists such as miletus ephesus smyrna now i̇zmir and byzantium now istanbul the latter founded by greek colonists from megara in 657 bc the first state that was called armenia by neighbouring peoples was the state of the armenian orontid dynasty which included parts of eastern turkey beginning in the 6th century bc in northwest turkey the most significant tribal group in thrace was the odyrisians founded by teres i
all of modern-day turkey was conquered by the persian achaemenid empire during the 6th century bc the greco-persian wars started when the greek city states on the coast of anatolia rebelled against persian rule in 499 bc the territory of turkey later fell to alexander the great in 334 bc which led to increasing cultural homogeneity and hellenization in the area
following alexanders death in 323 bc anatolia was subsequently divided into a number of small hellenistic kingdoms all of which became part of the roman republic by the mid-1st century bc the process of hellenization that began with alexanders conquest accelerated under roman rule and by the early centuries of the christian era the local anatolian languages and cultures had become extinct being largely replaced by ancient greek language and culture from the 1st century bc up to the 3rd century ce large parts of modern-day turkey were contested between the romans and neighbouring parthians through the frequent roman-parthian wars


 early christian and byzantine period 

according to acts of apostles 11 a city in the southern of turkey antioch now antakya is the birthplace of the first christian community
in 324 constantine i chose byzantium to be the new capital of the roman empire renaming it new rome following the death of theodosius i in 395 and the permanent division of the roman empire between his two sons the city which would popularly come to be known as constantinople became the capital of the eastern roman empire this empire which would later be branded by historians as the byzantine empire ruled most of the territory of present-day turkey until the late middle ages although the eastern regions remained in firm sasanian hands up to the first half of the seventh century the frequent byzantine-sassanid wars as part of the centuries long-lasting roman-persian wars fought between the neighbouring rivalling byzantines and sasanians took place in various parts of present-day turkey and decided much of the latters history from the fourth century up to the first half of the seventh century


 seljuks and the ottoman empire 

the house of seljuk was a branch of the kınık oğuz turks who resided on the periphery of the muslim world in the yabgu khaganate of the oğuz confederacy to the north of the caspian and aral seas in the 9th century in the 10th century the seljuks started migrating from their ancestral homeland into persia which became the administrative core of the great seljuk empire after its foundation by tughril
in the latter half of the 11th century the seljuk turks began penetrating into medieval armenia and the eastern regions of anatolia in 1071 the seljuks defeated the byzantines at the battle of manzikert starting the turkification process in the area the turkish language and islam were introduced to armenia and anatolia gradually spreading throughout the region the slow transition from a predominantly christian and greek-speaking anatolia to a predominantly muslim and turkish-speaking one was underway the mevlevi order of dervishes which was established in konya during the 13th century by sufi poet celaleddin rumi played a significant role in the islamization of the diverse people of anatolia who had previously been hellenized thus alongside the turkification of the territory the culturally persianized seljuks set the basis for a turko-persian principal culture in anatolia which their eventual successors the ottomans would take over
in 1243 the seljuk armies were defeated by the mongols at the battle of köse dağ causing the seljuk empires power to slowly disintegrate in its wake one of the turkish principalities governed by osman i would evolve over the next 200 years into the ottoman empire in 1453 the ottomans completed their conquest of the byzantine empire by capturing its capital constantinople

in 1514 sultan selim i 1512–1520 successfully expanded the empires southern and eastern borders by defeating shah ismail i of the safavid dynasty in the battle of chaldiran in 1517 selim i expanded ottoman rule into algeria and egypt and created a naval presence in the red sea subsequently a contest started between the ottoman and portuguese empires to become the dominant sea power in the indian ocean with a number of naval battles in the red sea the arabian sea and the persian gulf the portuguese presence in the indian ocean was perceived as a threat to the ottoman monopoly over the ancient trade routes between east asia and western europe despite the increasingly prominent european presence the ottoman empires trade with the east continued to flourish until the second half of the 18th century
the ottoman empires power and prestige peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries particularly during the reign of suleiman the magnificent who personally instituted major legislative changes relating to society education taxation and criminal law the empire was often at odds with the holy roman empire in its steady advance towards central europe through the balkans and the southern part of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth at sea the ottoman navy contended with several holy leagues such as those in 1538 1571 1684 and 1717 composed primarily of habsburg spain the republic of genoa the republic of venice the knights of st john the papal states the grand duchy of tuscany and the duchy of savoy for the control of the mediterranean sea in the east the ottomans were often at war with safavid persia over conflicts stemming from territorial disputes or religious differences between the 16th and 18th centuries the ottoman wars with persia continued as the zand afsharid and qajar dynasties succeeded the safavids in iran until the first half of the 19th century from the 16th to the early 20th centuries the ottoman empire also fought many wars with the russian tsardom and empire these were initially about ottoman territorial expansion and consolidation in southeastern and eastern europe but starting from the latter half of the 18th century they became more about the survival of the ottoman empire which had begun to lose its strategic territories on the northern black sea coast to the advancing russians

from the second half of the 18th century onwards the ottoman empire began to decline the tanzimat reforms of the 19th century which had been instituted by mahmud ii were aimed to modernise the ottoman state in line with the progress that had been made in western europe the efforts of midhat pasha during the late tanzimat era led the ottoman constitutional movement of 1876 which introduced the first constitutional era but these efforts proved to be inadequate in most fields and failed to stop the dissolution of the empire as the empire gradually shrank in size military power and wealth especially after the ottoman economic crisis and default in 1875 which led to uprisings in the balkan provinces that culminated into the russo-turkish war of 1877–78 many balkan muslims migrated to the empires heartland in anatolia along with the circassians fleeing the russian conquest of the caucasus the decline of the ottoman empire led to a rise in nationalist sentiment among its various subject peoples leading to increased ethnic tensions which occasionally burst into violence such as the hamidian massacres of armenians
the young turk revolution in 1908 restored the ottoman constitution and parliament 30 years after their suspension by sultan abdülhamid ii in 1878 which is known as the second constitutional era but the 1913 ottoman coup détat effectively put the country under the control of the three pashas making sultans mehmed v and mehmed vi largely symbolic figureheads with no real political power
the ottoman empire entered world war i on the side of the central powers and was ultimately defeated during the war the empires armenians were deported to syria as part of the armenian genocide as a result an estimated 800,000 to 1,500,000 armenians were killed the turkish government has refused to acknowledge the events as genocide and claims that armenians were only relocated from the eastern war zone genocidal campaigns were also committed against the empires other minority groups such as the assyrians and greeks following the armistice of mudros on 30 october 1918 the victorious allied powers sought to partition the ottoman state through the 1920 treaty of sèvres

mustafa kemal became the republics first president and subsequently introduced many radical reforms with the aim of transforming the old religion-based and multi-communal ottoman state system constitutional monarchy into an essentially turkish nation state parliamentary republic with a secular constitution with the surname law of 1934 the turkish parliament bestowed upon mustafa kemal the honorific surname atatürk father of the turks

 administrative divisions 

turkey has a unitary structure in terms of administration and this aspect is one of the most important factors shaping the turkish public administration when three powers executive legislative and judiciary are taken into account as the main functions of the state local administrations have little power turkey doesnt have a federal system and the provinces are subordinate to the central government in ankara local administrations were established to provide services in place and the government is represented by the province governors vali and town governors kaymakam other senior public officials are also appointed by the central government instead of the mayors belediye başkanı or elected by constituents turkish municipalities have local legislative bodies belediye meclisi for decision-making on municipal issues
within this unitary framework turkey is subdivided into 81 provinces il or vilayet for administrative purposes each province is divided into districts ilçe for a total of 923 districts turkey is also subdivided into 7 regions bölge and 21 subregions for geographic demographic and economic purposes this does not refer to an administrative division the centralised structure of decision-making in ankara is considered by some academicians as an impediment to good local governance and occasionally causes resentment in the municipalities of urban centres that are inhabited largely by ethnic minority groups such as the kurds steps towards decentralisation since 2004 have proven to be a highly controversial topic in turkey the efforts to decentralise the administrative structure are also driven by the european charter of local self-government and with chapter 22 regional policy  coordination of structural instruments of the acquis of the european union a decentralisation program for turkey has been a topic of discussion in the countrys academics politics and the broader public

 law 

turkeys judicial system has been wholly integrated with the system of continental europe for instance the turkish civil code has been modified by incorporating elements mainly of the swiss civil code and code of obligations and the german commercial code the administrative code bears similarities with its french counterpart and the penal code with its italian counterpart
turkey has adopted the principle of the separation of powers in line with this principle judicial power is exercised by independent courts on behalf of the turkish nation the independence and organisation of the courts the security of the tenure of judges and public prosecutors the profession of judges and prosecutors the supervision of judges and public prosecutors the military courts and their organisation and the powers and duties of the high courts are regulated by the turkish constitution

in the years of government by the akp and tayyip erdoğan particularly since 2013 the independence and integrity of the turkish judiciary has increasingly been considered in doubt by institutions parliamentarians and journalists both within and outside of turkey due to political interference in the promotion of judges and prosecutors and in their pursuit of public duty the turkey 2015 report of the european commission stated that the independence of the judiciary and respect of the principle of separation of powers have been undermined and judges and prosecutors have been under strong political pressure


 foreign relations 

turkey is a founding member of the united nations 1945 the oecd 1961 the oic 1969 the osce 1973 the eco 1985 the bsec 1992 the d-8 1997 and the g-20 1999 turkey was a member of the united nations security council in 1951–1952 1954–1955 1961 and 2009–2010 in 2012 turkey became a dialogue member of the sco and in 2013 became a member of the acd

the other defining aspect of turkeys foreign policy is the countrys long-standing strategic alliance with the united states the common threat posed by the soviet union during the cold war led to turkeys membership of nato in 1952 ensuring close bilateral relations with washington subsequently turkey benefited from the united states political economic and diplomatic support including in key issues such as the countrys bid to join the european union in the post–cold war environment turkeys geostrategic importance shifted towards its proximity to the middle east the caucasus and the balkans

 history 

in the early decades of the turkish republic the government or banks established and owned by the government such as türkiye i̇ş bankası 1924 sanayi ve maadin bankası 1925 emlak ve eytam bankası 1926 central bank of turkey 1930 sümerbank 1933 i̇ller bankası 1933 etibank 1935 denizbank 1937 halk bankası 1938 etc had to subsidise most of the industrial projects due to the lack of a strong private sector however in the period between the 1920s and 1950s a new generation of turkish entrepreneurs such as nuri demirağ vehbi koç hacı ömer sabancı and nejat eczacıbaşı began to establish privately owned factories some of which evolved into the largest industrial conglomerates that dominate the turkish economy today such as koç holding sabancı holding and eczacıbaşı holding
during the first six decades of the republic between 1923 and 1983 turkey generally adhered to a quasi-statist approach with strict government planning of the budget and government-imposed limitations over foreign trade flow of foreign currency foreign direct investment and private sector participation in certain fields such as broadcasting telecommunications energy mining etc however in 1983 prime minister turgut özal initiated a series of reforms designed to shift the economy from a statist insulated system to a more private-sector market-based model
the reforms combined with unprecedented amounts of funding from foreign loans spurred rapid economic growth but this growth was punctuated by sharp recessions and financial crises in 1994 1999 following the earthquake of that year and 2001 resulting in an average of 4 percent gdp growth per annum between 1981 and 2003 lack of additional fiscal reforms combined with large and growing public sector deficits and widespread corruption resulted in high inflation a weak banking sector and increased macroeconomic volatility since the economic crisis of 2001 and the reforms initiated by the finance minister of the time kemal derviş inflation has dropped to single-digit figures for the first time in decades 8% in 2005 investor confidence and foreign investment have soared and unemployment has fallen 10% in 2005
turkey has gradually opened up its markets through economic reforms by reducing government controls on foreign trade and investment and the privatisation of publicly owned industries and the liberalisation of many sectors to private and foreign participation has continued amid political debate the public debt-to-gdp ratio peaked at 75.9 percent during the recession of 2001 falling to an estimated 26.9 percent by 2013
the real gdp growth rate from 2002 to 2007 averaged 6.8 percent annually which made turkey one of the fastest growing economies in the world during that period however growth slowed to 1 percent in 2008 and in 2009 the turkish economy was affected by the global financial crisis with a recession of 5 percent the economy was estimated to have returned to 8 percent growth in 2010 according to eurostat data turkish gdp per capita adjusted by purchasing power standard stood at 52 percent of the eu average in 2011
in the early years of the 21st century the chronically high inflation was brought under control this led to the launch of a new currency the turkish new lira yeni türk lirası in 2005 to cement the acquisition of the economic reforms and erase the vestiges of an unstable economy in 2009 after only four years in circulation the turkish new lira was renamed back to the turkish lira with the introduction of new banknotes and coins and the withdrawal of the turkish new lira banknotes and coins that were introduced in 2005 but the iso 4217 code of the turkish new lira try remains in use for the current turkish lira in the foreign exchange market

turkish miniature is an art form which can be linked to the persian miniature tradition as well as strong chinese artistic influences the words taswir or nakish were used to define the art of miniature painting in ottoman turkish the studios the artists worked in were called nakkashanes the miniatures were usually not signed perhaps because of the rejection of individualism but also because the works were not created entirely by one person the head painter designed the composition of the scene and his apprentices drew the contours which were called tahrir with black or colored ink and then painted the miniature without creating an illusion of third dimension the head painter and much more often the scribe of the text were indeed named and depicted in some of the manuscripts the understanding of perspective was different from that of the nearby european renaissance painting tradition and the scene depicted often included different time periods and spaces in one picture they followed closely the context of the book they were included in resembling more illustrations rather than standalone works of art

the origin of turkish theatre dates back thousands of years to ancient pagan rituals the dances music and songs performed during the rituals of the inhabitants of anatolia millennia ago are the elements from which the first shows originated these rituals later became theatrical shows in the 10th century a blend of traditions occurred between the seljuk turks and those of the inhabitants of anatolia the interaction between the various tribal societies paved the way for new plays after the tanzimat reformation period characters in turkish theatre were modernized and plays were performed on european-style stages with the actors wearing european costumes following the declaration of the second constitutional monarchy in 1908 theatrical activities increased and social problems began to be reflected in the theatre as well as in historical plays a theatrical conservatoire darülbedayi-i osmani was established in istanbul in 1914 during the years of chaos and war the darülbedayi-i osmani continued its activities and attracted the younger generation turkish playwrights emerged some wrote on romantic subjects others were interested in social problems and still others dealt with nationalistic themes there were even those who wrote musicals in time turkish ladies began to appear on stage and this was indeed a revolution of the time since female roles had only been played by actresses who were members of turkey’s ethnic minorities today theatre acts are performed by numerous private theatre companies and subsidized companies such as the turkish state theatres


 music and dance 

music of turkey includes mainly turkic elements as well as partial influences ranging from central asian folk music arabic music greek music ottoman music persian music and balkan music as well as references to more modern european and american popular music the roots of traditional music in turkey span across centuries to a time when the seljuk turks migrated to anatolia and persia in the 11th century and contains elements of both turkic and pre-turkic influences much of its modern popular music can trace its roots to the emergence in the early 1930s drive for westernization
