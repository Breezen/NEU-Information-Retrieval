an absorption refrigerator is a refrigerator that uses a heat source eg solar energy a fossil-fueled flame waste heat from factories or district heating systems to provide the energy needed to drive the cooling process
absorption refrigerators are often used for food storage in recreational vehicles the principle can also be used to air-condition buildings using the waste heat from a gas turbine or water heater using waste heat from a gas turbine makes the turbine very efficient because it first produces electricity then hot water and finally air-conditioning called cogenerationtrigeneration
the american national standards institute standard for the absorption refrigerator is given by the ansiahri standard 560–2000


 history 
in the early years of the twentieth century the vapor absorption cycle using water-ammonia systems was popular and widely used but after the development of the vapor compression cycle it lost much of its importance because of its low coefficient of performance about one fifth of that of the vapor compression cycle nowadays the vapor absorption cycle is used only where waste heat is available or where heat is derived from solar collectors absorption refrigerators are a popular alternative to regular compressor refrigerators where electricity is unreliable costly or unavailable where noise from the compressor is problematic or where surplus heat is available eg from turbine exhausts or industrial processes or from solar plants
absorption cooling was invented by the french scientist ferdinand carré in 1858 the original design used water and sulphuric acid
in 1922 baltzar von platen and carl munters while they were still students at the royal institute of technology in stockholm sweden enhanced the principle with a 3-fluid configuration this platen-munters design can operate without a pump
commercial production began in 1923 by the newly formed company ab arctic which was bought by electrolux in 1925 in the 1960s absorption refrigeration saw a renaissance due to the substantial demand for refrigerators for caravans travel trailers ab electrolux established a subsidiary in the united states named dometic sales corporation the company marketed refrigerators for rvs under the dometic brand in 2001 electrolux sold most of its leisure products line to the venture-capital company eqt which created dometic as a stand-alone company
in 1926 albert einstein and his former student leó szilárd proposed an alternative design known as the einstein refrigerator
at the 2007 ted conference adam grosser presented his research of a new very small intermittent absorption vaccine refrigeration unit for use in third world countries the refrigerator is a small unit placed over a campfire that can later be used to cool 15 liters of water to just above freezing for 24 hours in a 30 °c environment


 principles 

both absorption and compressor refrigerators use a refrigerant with a very low boiling point less than −18 °c 0 °f in both types when this refrigerant evaporates boils it takes some heat away with it providing the cooling effect the main difference between the two systems is the way the refrigerant is changed from a gas back into a liquid so that the cycle can repeat an absorption refrigerator changes the gas back into a liquid using a method that needs only heat and has no moving parts other than the refrigerant itself
the absorption cooling cycle can be described in three phases
evaporation a liquid refrigerant evaporates in a low partial pressure environment thus extracting heat from its surroundings eg the refrigerators compartment because of the low partial pressure the temperature needed for evaporation is also low
absorption the now gaseous refrigerant is absorbed by another liquid eg a salt solution
regeneration the refrigerant-saturated liquid is heated causing the refrigerant to evaporate out the hot gaseous refrigerant passes through a heat exchanger transferring its heat outside the system such as to surrounding ambient-temperature air and condenses the condensed liquid refrigerant supplies the evaporation phase
in comparison a compressor refrigerator uses a compressor usually powered by either an electric or internal combustion motor to increase the pressure on the gaseous refrigerant the resulting hot high-pressure gas is condensed to a liquid form by cooling in a heat exchanger condenser that is exposed to the external environment usually air in the room the condensed refrigerant now at a temperature near to that of the external environment then passes through an orifice or a throttle valve into the evaporator section the orifice or throttle valve creates a pressure drop between the high pressure condenser section and the low pressure evaporator section the lower pressure in the evaporator section allows the liquid refrigerant to evaporate which absorbs heat from the refrigerator food compartment the now-vaporized refrigerant then goes back into the compressor to repeat the cycle
another difference between the two types is the refrigerant used compressor refrigerators typically use an hcfc or hfc while absorption refrigerators typically use ammonia or water


 simple salt and water system 
a simple absorption refrigeration system common in large commercial plants uses a solution of lithium bromide and lithium chloride salt and water water under low pressure is evaporated from the coils that are being chilled the water is absorbed by a lithium bromidewater solution the system drives the water off the lithium bromide solution with heat


 water spray absorption refrigeration 

another variant depicted to the right uses air water and a salt water solution the intake of warm moist air is passed through a sprayed solution of salt water the spray lowers the humidity but does not significantly change the temperature the less humid warm air is then passed through an evaporative cooler consisting of a spray of fresh water which cools and re-humidifies the air humidity is removed from the cooled air with another spray of salt solution providing the outlet of cool dry air
the salt solution is regenerated by heating it under low pressure causing water to evaporate the water evaporated from the salt solution is re-condensed and rerouted back to the evaporative cooler


 single pressure absorption refrigeration 

a single-pressure absorption refrigerator takes advantage of the fact that a substances boiling point depends upon the partial pressure of the vapor above the liquid and goes down with lower partial pressure while having the same total pressure throughout the system the refrigerator maintains a low partial pressure of the refrigerant therefore low boiling point in the part of the system that draws heat out of the low-temperature interior of the refrigerator but maintains the refrigerant at high partial pressure therefore high boiling point in the part of the system that expels heat to the ambient-temperature air outside the refrigerator
the refrigerator uses three substances ammonia hydrogen gas and water the cycle is closed with all hydrogen water and ammonia collected and endlessly reused the system is pressurized to the pressure where the boiling point of ammonia is higher than the temperature of the condenser coil the coil which transfers heat to the air outside the refrigerator by being hotter than the outside air this pressure is typically 14–16 atm at which pressure the dew point of ammonia will be about 35 °c 95 °f
the cooling cycle starts with liquid ammonia at room temperature entering the evaporator the volume of the evaporator is greater than the volume of the liquid with the excess space occupied by a mixture of gaseous ammonia and hydrogen the presence of hydrogen lowers the partial pressure of the ammonia gas thus lowering the boiling point of the liquid below the temperature of the refrigerators interior ammonia evaporates taking a small amount of heat from the liquid and lowering the liquids temperature until it reaches that boiling point it then continues to evaporate without the liquid descending below the boiling point while the large enthalpy of vaporization heat flows from the warmer refrigerator interior to the cooler liquid ammonia and then to more ammonia gas
in the next two steps the ammonia gas is separated from the hydrogen so it can be reused
the ammonia gas and hydrogen gas mixture flows through a pipe from the evaporator into the absorber in the absorber this mixture of gases contacts water technically a weak solution of ammonia in water the gaseous ammonia dissolves in the water while the hydrogen which doesnt collects at the top of the absorber leaving the now-strong ammonia-and-water solution at the bottom the hydrogen is now separate while the ammonia is now dissolved in the water
the next step separates the ammonia and water the ammoniawater solution flows to the generator boiler where heat is applied to boil off the ammonia leaving most of the water which has a higher boiling point behind some water vapor and bubbles remain mixed with the ammonia this water is removed in the final separation step by passing it through the separator an uphill series of twisted pipes with minor obstacles to pop the bubbles allowing the water vapor to condense and drain back to the generator
the pure ammonia gas then enters the condenser in this heat exchanger the hot ammonia gas transfers its heat to the outside air which is below the boiling point of the full-pressure ammonia and therefore condenses the condensed liquid ammonia flows down to be mixed with the hydrogen gas released from the absorption step repeating the cycle
