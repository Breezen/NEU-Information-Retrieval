adam guy riess born december 16 1969 is an american astrophysicist and bloomberg distinguished professor at johns hopkins university and the space telescope science institute and is known for his research in using supernovae as cosmological probes riess shared both the 2006 shaw prize in astronomy and the 2011 nobel prize in physics with saul perlmutter and brian p schmidt for providing evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating


 family 
riess was born in washington dc one of three children he grew up in warren new jersey where his father naval engineer michael riess owned a frozen-foods distribution company bistro international and his mother doris riess worked as a clinical psychologist michael riess 1931–2007 immigrated to the united states with his parents journalist war correspondent and author curt riess and ilse posnansky from germany on the ship ss europa 1928 in 1936 adam riess has two sisters— gail saltz a psychiatrist and holly hagerman an artist riess married nancy joy schondorf in 1998


 education 
he attended watchung hills regional high school graduating in the class of 1988 he also attended the prestigious new jersey governors school in the sciences in 1987 riess then graduated from the massachusetts institute of technology in 1992 where he was a member of the phi delta theta fraternity he received his phd from harvard university in 1996 it resulted in measurements of over twenty new type ia supernovae and a method to utilize type ia supernovae as accurate distance indicators by correcting for intervening dust and intrinsic inhomogeneities riess phd thesis was supervised by robert kirshner and william h press and won the robert j trumpler award in 1999 for phd theses of unusual importance to astronomy


 research 
riess was a miller fellow at the university of california berkeley before moving on to the space telescope science institute in 1999 he took up his current position at johns hopkins university in 2006 he also sits on the selection committee for the astronomy award given under the auspices of the shaw prize in july 2016 riess was named a bloomberg distinguished professor at johns hopkins university for his accomplishments as an interdisciplinary researcher and excellence in teaching the next generation of scholars the bloomberg distinguished professorships were established in 2013 by a gift from michael bloomberg
riess jointly led the study with brian schmidt in 1998 for the high-z supernova search team which first reported evidence that the universes expansion rate is now accelerating through monitoring of type ia supernovae the teams observations were contrary to the current theory that the expansion of the universe was slowing down instead by monitoring the color shifts in the light from supernovas from earth they discovered that these billion-year old novae were still accelerating this result was also found nearly simultaneously by the supernova cosmology project led by saul perlmutter the corroborating evidence between the two competing studies led to the acceptance of the accelerating universe theory and initiated new research to understand the nature of the universe such as the existence of dark energy the discovery of the accelerating universe was named breakthrough of the year by science magazine in 1998 and riess was jointly awarded the 2011 nobel prize in physics along with schmidt and perlmutter for their groundbreaking work
riess leads the higher-z sn search program which uses the hubble space telescope to discover the most distant supernovae yet seen by humankind his team has traced the universes expansion back more than 10 billion light years the key finding has been the detection of an early phase of decelerating expansion causing the most distant supernovae to look relatively brighter and thus disfavoring significant astrophysical dimming of supernovae this result thus confirms the dark energy-dark matter model as perceived from supernovae


 awards 

riess received the astronomical society of the pacifics robert j trumpler award in 1999 and harvard universitys bok prize in 2001 he won the american astronomical societys helen b warner prize in 2003 and the raymond and beverly sackler prize in 2004 for the discovery of cosmic acceleration
in 2006 he shared the 1 million shaw prize in astronomy with saul perlmutter and brian p schmidt for contributions to the discovery of the acceleration of the universe
schmidt and all the members of the high-z team as defined by the co-authors of riess et al 1998 shared the 2007 gruber cosmology prize a 500,000 award with the supernova cosmology project the set defined by the co-authors of perlmutter et al 1999 for their discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe riess was the winner of macarthur genius grant in 2008 he was also elected in 2009 to the national academy of sciences
along with perlmutter and schmidt he was awarded the 2011 nobel prize in physics for his contributions to the discovery of the acceleration of the expansion of the universe
riess along with brian p schmidt and the high-z supernova search team shared in the 2015 breakthrough prize in fundamental physics
