 inex series 
this eclipse is a part of the long period inex cycle repeating at alternating nodes every 358 synodic months ≈ 10,571.95 days or 29 years minus 20 days their appearance and longitude are irregular due to a lack of synchronization with the anomalistic month period of perigee however groupings of 3 inex cycles ≈ 87 years minus 2 months comes close ≈ 1,151.02 anomalistic months so eclipses are similar in these groupings
