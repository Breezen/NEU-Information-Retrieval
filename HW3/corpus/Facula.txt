solar faculae are bright spots that form in the canyons between solar granules short-lived convection cells several thousand kilometers across that constantly form and dissipate over timescales of several minutes faculae are produced by concentrations of magnetic field lines strong concentrations of faculae appear in solar activity with or without sunspots the faculae and the sunspots contribute noticeably to variations in the solar constant the chromospheric counterpart of a facular region is called a plage
