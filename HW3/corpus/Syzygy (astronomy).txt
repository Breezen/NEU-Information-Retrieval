in astronomy a syzygy  from the ancient greek σύζυγοσ suzugos meaning yoked together is a usually straight-line configuration of three or more celestial bodies in a gravitational system


 overview 
the word is often used in reference to the sun earth and either the moon or a planet where the latter is in conjunction or opposition solar and lunar eclipses occur at times of syzygy as do transits and occultations the term is often applied when the sun and moon are in conjunction new moon or opposition full moon
the word syzygy is often used to describe interesting configurations of astronomical objects in general for example one such case occurred on march 21 1894 around 2300 gmt when mercury transited the sun as would have been seen from venus and mercury and venus both simultaneously transited the sun as seen from saturn it is also used to describe situations when all the planets are on the same side of the sun although they are not necessarily in a straight line such as on march 10 1982
on june 3 2014 the curiosity rover on mars observed the planet mercury transiting the sun marking the first time a planetary transit has been observed from a celestial body besides earth


 occultations transits and eclipses 
syzygy sometimes results in an occultation transit or eclipse
an occultation occurs when an apparently larger body passes in front of an apparently smaller one
a transit occurs when a smaller body passes in front of a larger one
in the combined case where the smaller body regularly transits the larger an occultation is also termed a secondary eclipse

an eclipse occurs when a body totally or partially disappears from view either by an occultation as with a solar eclipse or by passing into the shadow of another body as with a lunar eclipse thus both are listed on nasas eclipse page
transits and occultations of the sun by earths moon are called solar eclipses regardless of whether the sun is completely or partially covered by extension transits of the sun by a satellite of a planet may also be called eclipses as with the transits of phobos and deimos shown on nasas jpl photojournal as may the passage of a satellite into the planets shadow as with this eclipse of phobos the term eclipse is also used more generally for bodies passing in front of one another for example a nasa astronomy picture of the day refers to the moon eclipsing and occulting saturn interchangeably


 einstein ring 
as electromagnetic rays are somewhat bent by gravitation when they pass by a heavy mass one says the mass acts as a gravitational lens if the light source the diffracting mass and the observer stand in a line one sees an einstein ring


 tidal variation 

syzygy causes the bimonthly phenomena of spring and neap tides at the new and full moon the sun and moon are in syzygy their tidal forces act to reinforce each other and the ocean both rises higher and falls lower than the average conversely at the first and third quarter the sun and moon are at right angles their tidal forces counteract each other and the tidal range is smaller than average tidal variation can also be measured in the earths crust and this may affect the frequency of earthquakes
