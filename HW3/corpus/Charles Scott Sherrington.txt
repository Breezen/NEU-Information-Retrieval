sir charles scott sherrington  27 november 1857 – 4 march 1952 was an english neurophysiologist histologist bacteriologist and a pathologist nobel laureate and president of the royal society in the early 1920s he received the nobel prize in physiology or medicine with edgar adrian 1st baron adrian in 1932 for their work on the functions of neurons prior to the work of sherrington and adrian it was widely accepted that reflexes occurred as isolated activity within a reflex arc sherrington received the prize for showing that reflexes require integrated activation and demonstrated reciprocal innervation of muscles sherringtons law through his seminal 1906 publication the integrative action of the nervous system he had effectively laid to rest the theory that the nervous system including the brain can be understood as a single interlinking network his alternative explanation of synaptic communication between neurons helped shape our understanding of the central nervous system


 biography 


 early years and education 
official biographies claim charles scott sherrington was born in islington london england on 27 november 1857 and that he was the son of james norton sherrington a country doctor and his wife anne thurtell however james norton sherrington was an ironmonger and artists colourman in great yarmouth not a doctor and died in yarmouth in 1848 nearly 9 years before charles was born in the 1861 census charles is recorded as charles scott boarder 4 born india with anne sherrington widow as the head and caleb rose visitor married surgeon he was brought up in this household with caleb recorded as head in 1871 although ann and caleb did not marry until after the death of his wife in 1880 the relationship between charles and his childhood family is unknown during the 1860s the whole family moved to anglesea road ipswich reputedly because london exacerbated caleb roses tendency to asthma
caleb rose was noteworthy as both a classical scholar and an archaeologist at the familys edgehill house in ipswich one could find a fine selection of paintings books and geological specimens through roses interest in the norwich school of painters sherrington gained a love of art intellectuals frequented the house regularly it was this environment that fostered sherringtons academic sense of wonder even before matriculation the young sherrington had read johannes müllers elements of physiology the book was given to him by caleb rose
sherrington entered ipswich school in 1871 thomas ashe a famous english poet worked at the school ashe served as an inspiration to sherrington the former instilling a love of classics and a desire to travel in the latter
rose had pushed sherrington towards medicine sherrington first began to study with the royal college of surgeons of england he also sought to study at cambridge but a bank failure had devastated the familys finances sherrington elected to enroll at st thomas hospital in september 1876 as a perpetual pupil he did so in order to allow his two younger brothers to do so ahead of him the two studied law there medical studies at st thomass hospital were intertwined with studies at gonville and caius college cambridge physiology was sherringtons chosen major at cambridge there he studied under the father of british physiology sir michael foster
sherrington played football for his grammar school and for ipswich town football club rugby st thomass was on the rowing team at oxford during june 1875 sherrington passed his preliminary examination in general education at the royal college this preliminary exam was required for fellowship and also exempted him from a similar exam for the membership in april 1878 he passed his primary examination for the membership of the royal college of surgeons and 12 months later the primary for fellowship
in october 1879 sherrington entered cambridge as a non-collegiate student the following year he entered gonville and caius college sherrington was quite the student in june 1881 he took part i in the natural sciences tripos and was awarded a starred first in physiology there were 9 candidates in all 8 men 1 woman of whom five gained firsts in june 1883 in part ii of the tripos he also gained a first alongside william bateson walter holbrook gaskell one of sherringtons tutors informed him in november 1881 that he had earned the highest marks for his year in botany human anatomy and physiology second in zoology and highest overall john newport langley was sherringtons other tutor the two were interested in how anatomical structure is expressed in physiological function
sherrington earned his membership of the royal college of surgeons on 4 august 1884 in 1885 he obtained a first class in the natural science tripos with the mark of distinction in the same year sherrington earned the degree of mb bachelor of medicine and surgery from cambridge in 1886 sherrington added the title of lrcp licentiate of the royal college of physicians


 seventh international medical congress 

the conference was held in london in 1881 it was at this conference that sherrington began his work in neurological research at the conference controversy broke out friedrich goltz of strasbourg argued that localized function in the cortex did not exist goltz came to this conclusion after observing dogs who had parts of their brains removed david ferrier who became a hero of sherringtons disagreed ferrier maintained that there was localization of function in the brain ferriers strongest evidence was a monkey who suffered from hemiplegia paralysis affecting one side of the body only after a cerebral lesion
a committee including langley was made up to investigate both the dog and the monkey were chloroformed the right hemisphere of the dog was delivered to cambridge for examination sherrington performed a histological examination of the hemisphere acting as a junior colleague to langley in 1884 langley and sherrington reported on their findings in a paper the paper was the first for sherrington


 travel 
in the winter of 1884–1885 sherrington left england for strasbourg there he worked with goltz goltz like many others positively influenced sherrington sherrington later said of goltz that he taught one that in all things only the best is good enough
a case of asiatic cholera had broken out in spain in 1885 a spanish physician claimed to have produced a vaccine to fight the outbreak under the auspices of cambridge university the royal society of london and the association for research in medicine a group was put together to travel to spain to investigate cs roy j graham brown and sherrington formed the group roy was sherringtons friend and the newly elected professor of pathology at cambridge as the three traveled to toledo sherrington was skeptical of the spanish physician upon returning the three presented a report to the royal society the report discredited the spaniards claim
it should be mentioned that sherrington did not meet santiago ramón y cajal on this trip while sherrington and his group remained in toledo cajal was hundreds of miles away in zaragoza
later that year sherrington traveled to rudolf virchow in berlin to inspect the cholera specimens he procured in spain virchow later on sent sherrington to robert koch for a six weeks course in technique sherrington ended up staying with koch for a year to do research in bacteriology under these two sherrington parted with a good foundation in physiology morphology histology and pathology during this period he may have also studied with waldeyer and zuntz
in 1886 sherrington went to italy to again investigate a cholera outbreak while in italy sherrington spent much time in art galleries it was in this country that sherringtons love for rare books became an addiction


 employment 

in 1891 sherrington was appointed as superintendent of the brown institute for advanced physiological and pathological research of the university of london a center for human and animal physiological and pathological research sherrington succeeded sir victor alexander haden horsley there sherrington worked on segmental distribution of the spinal dorsal and ventral roots he mapped the sensory dermatomes and in 1892 discovered that muscle spindles initiated the stretch reflex the institute allowed sherrington to study many animals both small and large the brown institute had enough space to work with large primates such as apes


 liverpool 
sherringtons first job of full-professorship came with his appointment as holt professor of physiology at liverpool in 1895 succeeding francis gotch with his appointment to the holt chair sherrington ended his active work in pathology working on cats dogs monkeys and apes that had been bereaved of their cerebral hemispheres he found that reflexes must be considered integrated activities of the total organism not just the result of activities of the so-called reflex-arcs a concept then generally accepted there he continued his work on reflexes and reciprocal innervation his papers on the subject were synthesized into the croonian lecture of 1897
sherrington showed that muscle excitation was inversely proportional to the inhibition of an opposing group of muscles speaking of the excitation-inhibition relationship sherrington said desistence from action may be as truly active as is the taking of action sherrington continued his work on reciprocal innervation during his years at liverpool come 1913 sherrington was able to say that the process of excitation and inhibition may be viewed as polar opposites  the one is able to neutralize the other sherringtons work on reciprocal innervation was a notable contribution to the knowledge of the spinal cord


 oxford 
as early as 1895 sherrington had tried to gain employment at oxford university by 1913 the wait was over oxford offered sherrington the waynflete chair of physiology the electors to that chair unanimously recommended sherrington without considering any other candidates sherrington enjoyed the honor of teaching many bright students at oxford including wilder penfield who he introduced to the study of the brain several of his students were rhodes scholars three of whom - sir john eccles ragnar granit and howard florey - went on to be nobel laureates sherrington also influenced american pioneer brain surgeon harvey williams cushing
sherringtons philosophy as a teacher can be seen in his response to the question of what was the real function of oxford university in the world sherrington said

after some hundreds of years of experience we think that we have learned here in oxford how to teach what is known but now with the undeniable upsurge of scientific research we cannot continue to rely on the mere fact that we have learned how to teach what is known we must learn to teach the best attitude to what is not yet known this also may take centuries to acquire but we cannot escape this new challenge nor do we want to

while at oxford sherrington kept hundreds of microscope slides in a specially constructed box labelled sir charles sherringtons histology demonstration slides as well as histology demonstration slides the box contains slides which may be related to original breakthroughs such as cortical localization in the brain slides from contemporaries such as angelo ruffini and gustav fritsch and slides from colleagues at oxford such as john burdon-sanderson – the first waynflete chair of physiology – and derek denny-brown who worked with sherrington at oxford 1924–1928
sherringtons teachings at oxford were interrupted by world war i when the war started it left his classes with only nine students during the war he laboured at a shell factory to support the war and to study fatigue in general but specifically industrial fatigue his weekday work hours were from 730am to 830pm and from 730am to 600pm on the weekends
in march 1916 sherrington fought for women to be admitted to the medical school at oxford


 retirement 
charles sherrington retired from oxford in the year of 1936 he then moved to his boyhood town of ipswich where he built a house there he kept up a large correspondence with pupils and others from around the world he also continued to work on his poetic historical and philosophical interests from 1944 until his own death he was president of the ipswich museum on the committee of which he had previously served
sherringtons mental faculties were crystal clear up to the time of his sudden death which was caused by a sudden heart failure at age 94 his bodily health however did suffer in old age arthritis was a major burden of his speaking of his condition sherrington said old age isnt pleasant one cant do things for oneself the arthritis put sherrington in a nursing home in the year before his death in 1951


 personal life 
on 27 august 1891 sherrington married ethel mary wright d.1933 wright was the daughter of john ely wright of preston manor suffolk england sherrington and wright had one child a son named charles er carr sherrington who was born in 1897 wright was both loyal and lively she was a great host on weekends during the oxford years the couple would frequently host a large group of friends and acquaintances at their house for an enjoyable afternoon


 noted publications 
the integrative action of the nervous system
published in 1906 this was a compendium of ten of sherringtons silliman lectures delivered at yale university in 1904 in the publication he discussed neuron theory the synapse a term he had coined in 1897 and communication between neurons and a mechanism for the reflex-arc function the work effectively resolved the debate between neuron and reticular theory in mammals thereby shaping our understanding of the central nervous system he expressed his theory that the nervous system acts as the coordinator of various parts of the body and that the reflexes are the simplest expressions of the interactive action of the nervous system enabling the entire body to function toward one definite end at a time he also pointed out that reflexes have to be goal-directive and purposive furthermore he established the nature of postural reflexes and their dependence on the anti-gravity stretch reflex and traced the afferent stimulus to the proprioceptive end organs which he had previously shown to be sensory in nature proprioceptive was another term he had coined the work was dedicated to ferrier
man on his nature
a reflection of sherringtons philosophical thought sherrington had long studied the 16th century french physician jean fernel and grew so familiar with him that he considered him a friend in the years of 1937 and 1938 sherrington delivered the gifford lectures at the university of edinburgh these focused on fernel and his times and came to form the principal content of man on his nature the book was released in 1940 and a revised edition came out in 1951 it explores philosophical thoughts about the mind the human existence and god in connection with natural theology chapters of the book align with the twelve zodiac signs in his ideas on the mind and cognition sherrington introduced the idea that neurons work as groups in a million-fold democracy to produce outcomes rather than with central control
the assaying of brabantius and other verse
a collection of previously published war-time poems this was sherringtons first major poetic release the assaying was published in 1925 sherringtons poetic side was inspired by johann wolfgang von goethe sherrington was fond of goethe the poet but not goethe the scientist speaking of goethes scientific writings sherrington said to appraise them is not a congenial task
mammalian physiology a course of practical exercises
the textbook was released in 1919 at the first possible moment after sherringtons coming to oxford and the end of the war

 eponyms 
liddell-sherrington reflex
associated with edward george tandy liddell and charles scott sherrington the liddell-sherrington reflex is the tonic contraction of muscle in response to its being stretched when a muscle lengthens beyond a certain point the myotatic reflex causes it to tighten and attempt to shorten this is the tension you feel during stretching exercises
schiff-sherrington reflex
associated with moritz schiff and charles scott sherrington describes a grave sign in animals rigid extension of the forelimbs after damage to the spine it may be accompanied by paradoxical respiration – the intercostal muscles are paralysed and the chest is drawn passively in and out by the diaphragm
sherringtons first law
every posterior spinal nerve root supplies a particular area of the skin with a certain overlap of adjacent dermatomes
sherringtons second law
the law of reciprocal innervation when contraction of a muscle is stimulated there is a simultaneous inhibition of its antagonist it is essential for coordinated movement
vulpian-heidenhain-sherrington phenomenon
associated with rudolf peter heinrich heidenhain edmé félix alfred vulpian and charles scott sherrington describes the slow contraction of denervated skeletal muscle by stimulating autonomic cholinergic fibres innervating its blood vessels
