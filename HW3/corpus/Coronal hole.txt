coronal holes are areas where the suns corona is colder hence darker and has lower-density plasma than average because there is lower energy and gas levels coronal holes are part of the suns corona and are constantly changing and reshaping because the corona is not uniform the sun contains magnetic fields that arch away from areas in the corona that are very thin due to the lower levels of energy and gas which cause coronal holes to appear when they do not fall back thus solar particles escape at a rate great enough to create a lower density and lower temperature in that area


 first discoveries 
in the 1960s the sydney chris cross radio telescope took x-ray images although it was unclear what they were some research also points out that coronal holes were first spotted in the early 1970s these were found when x-ray telescopes in the skylab mission were flown above the earths atmosphere to reveal the structure of the corona


 solar cycle 
coronal hole size and population correspond with the solar cycle as the sun heads toward solar maximum the coronal holes move closer and closer to the suns poles during solar maximum the number of coronal holes decreases until the magnetic fields on the sun reverse afterwards new coronal holes appear near the new poles the coronal holes then increase in size and number extending farther from the poles as the sun moves toward solar minimum again there are permanent coronal holes on the north and south poles of the sun


 coronal holes and solar wind 
coronal holes generally discharge solar wind at a speed about twice the average the escaping solar wind is known to travel along open magnetic field lines that pass through the coronal hole area since coronal holes are regions in the sun’s corona that have much lower densities and temperatures than most of the corona these regions are very thin this thinness contributes to the solar wind since particles within the chromosphere can more easily break through


 influence on space weather 
during solar minima coronal holes are the primary sources of space weather disturbances typically geomagnetic and proton storms originating from coronal holes have a gradual commencement over hours and are not as severe as storms caused by coronal mass ejections cmes which usually have a sudden onset due to the fact coronal holes can last for several months it is often possible to predict the recurrence of this type of disturbance significantly farther in advance than for cme related disturbances
