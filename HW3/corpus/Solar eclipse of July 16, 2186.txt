there will be a solar eclipse on july 16 2186 which will be the longest total eclipse for thousands of years the eclipse will pass over the southern galápagos islands with a total eclipse of 4 minutes occurring over the southern tip of española island the northern tip of ecuador with a total eclipse of 3 minutes and 26 seconds on isla santa rosa central colombia 4 minutes and 50 seconds over bogota central venezuela and northern guyana 7 minutes and 4 seconds just north of anna regina


 extreme duration 

this will be the longest total solar eclipse between the dates of 4000 bc and at least ad 8000 12,000 years lasting a maximum of 7 minutes 29 seconds the factors that will make this such a long eclipse are
the earth being very near aphelion furthest away from the sun in its elliptical orbit making its angular diameter nearly as small as possible this occurs around july 6th
the moon being almost exactly at perigee making its angular diameter as large as possible the moment of greatest eclipse will be just 50 minutes after perigee
the midpoint of the eclipse being very close to the earths equator where the earths rotational velocity is greatest
the midpoint of the eclipse being near the subsolar point the part of the earth closest to the sun and therefore also closest to the moon during an eclipse
the vector of the eclipse path at the midpoint of the eclipse aligning with the vector of the earths rotation ie not diagonal but due east for solar eclipses at the ascending node odd numbered saros this occurs approximately 12 days after the summer solstice
the longest historical total eclipse lasted 7 minutes 28 seconds on june 15 744bc the longest eclipse theoretically possible for the 3rd millennium is 7 minutes and 32 seconds

 saros 139 
it is a part of saros series 139 repeating every 18 years 11 days 8 hours containing 71 events the series started with partial solar eclipse on may 17 1501 it contains hybrid eclipses on august 11 1627 through december 9 1825 and total eclipses from december 21 1843 through march 26 2601 the series ends at member 71 as a partial eclipse on july 3 2763 members in the same column are one exeligmos apart and thus occur in the same geographic area
the solar eclipse of june 13 2132 will be the longest total solar eclipse since july 11 1991 at 6 minutes 55 seconds
the longest duration of totality will be produced by member 39 at 7 minutes 29 seconds on july 16 2186 this is the longest solar eclipse computed between 4000bc and 6000ad
