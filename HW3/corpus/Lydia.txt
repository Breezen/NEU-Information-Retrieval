lydia assyrian luddu greek λυδία lydía turkish lidya was an iron age kingdom of western asia minor located generally east of ancient ionia in the modern western turkish provinces of uşak manisa and inland i̇zmir its population spoke an anatolian language known as lydian its capital was sardis
the kingdom of lydia existed from about 1200 bce to 546 bce at its greatest extent during the 7th century bce it covered all of western anatolia in 546 bce it became a province of the achaemenid persian empire known as the satrapy of lydia or sparda in old persian in 133 bce it became part of the roman province of asia
coins are said to have been invented in lydia around the 7th century bce


 defining lydia 
the endonym śfard the name the lydians called themselves survives in bilingual and trilingual stone-carved notices of the achaemenid empire the satrapy of sparda old persian aramaic saparda babylonian sapardu elamitic išbarda hebrew סְפָרַד these in the greek tradition are associated with sardis the capital city of king gyges constructed during the 7th century bce
the region of the lydian kingdom was during the 15th-14th centuries part of the arzawa kingdom however the lydian language is not usually categorized as part of the luwic subgroup as are the other nearby anatolian languages luwian carian and lycian
an etruscanlydian association has long been a subject of conjecture the greek historian herodotus stated that the etruscans came from lydia repeated in virgils epic poem the aeneid and etruscan-like language was found on the lemnos stele from the aegean sea island of lemnos however the decipherment of lydian and its classification as an anatolian language mean that etruscan and lydian were not even part of the same language family nevertheless a recent genetic study of likely etruscan descendants in tuscany found strong similarities with individuals in western anatolia indicating that etruscans may have lived in or near the region at one time


 geography 
the boundaries of historical lydia varied across the centuries it was bounded first by mysia caria phrygia and coastal ionia later the military power of alyattes ii and croesus expanded lydia which with its capital at sardis controlled all asia minor west of the river halys except lycia lydia never again shrank back into its original dimensions after the persian conquest the river maeander was regarded as its southern boundary and during imperial roman times lydia comprised the country between mysia and caria on the one side and phrygia and the aegean sea on the other


 language 
the lydian language was an indo-european language in the anatolian language family related to luwian and hittite due to its fragmentary attestation the meanings of many words are unknown but much of the grammar has been determined similar to other anatolian languages it featured extensive use of prefixes and grammatical particles to chain clauses together lydian had also undergone extensive syncope leading to numerous consonant clusters atypical of indo-european languages lydian finally became extinct during the 1st century bce


 history 


 early history maeonia and lydia 
lydia developed after the decline of the hittite empire in the 12th century bce in hittite times the name for the region had been arzawa according to greek source the original name of the lydian kingdom was maionia μαιονία or maeonia homer iliad ii 865 v 43 xi 431 refers to the inhabitants of lydia as maiones μαίονεσ homer describes their capital not as sardis but as hyde iliad xx 385 hyde may have been the name of the district in which sardis was located later herodotus histories i 7 adds that the meiones were renamed lydians after their king lydus λυδόσ son of atys during the mythical epoch that preceded the heracleid dynasty this etiological eponym served to account for the greek ethnic name lydoi λυδοί the hebrew term for lydians lûḏîm לודים as found in the book of jeremiah 46.9 has been similarly considered beginning with flavius josephus to be derived from lud son of shem however hippolytus of rome 234 ce offered an alternative opinion that the lydians were descended from ludim son of mizraim during biblical times the lydian warriors were famous archers some maeones still existed during historical times in the upland interior along the river hermus where a town named maeonia existed according to pliny the elder natural history book v30 and hierocles author of synecdemus


 in greek mythology 
lydian mythology is virtually unknown and their literature and rituals lost due to the absence of any monuments or archaeological finds with extensive inscriptions therefore myths involving lydia are mainly from greek mythology
for the greeks tantalus was a primordial ruler of mythic lydia and niobe his proud daughter her husband amphion associated lydia with thebes in greece and through pelops the line of tantalus was part of the founding myths of mycenaes second dynasty in reference to the myth of bellerophon karl kerenyi remarked in the heroes of the greeks 1959 p 83 as lykia was thus connected with crete and as the person of pelops the hero of olympia connected lydia with the peloponnesos so bellerophontes connected another asian country or rather two lykia and karia with the kingdom of argos
in greek myth lydia had also adopted the double-axe symbol that also appears in the mycenaean civilization the labrys omphale daughter of the river iardanos was a ruler of lydia whom heracles was required to serve for a time his adventures in lydia are the adventures of a greek hero in a peripheral and foreign land during his stay heracles enslaved the itones killed syleus who forced passers-by to hoe his vineyard slew the serpent of the river sangarios which appears in the heavens as the constellation ophiucus and captured the simian tricksters the cercopes accounts tell of at least one son born to omphale and heracles diodorus siculus 4.31.8 and ovid heroides 9.54 mention a son lamos while pseudo-apollodorus bibliotheke 2.7.8 gives the name agelaus and pausanias 2.21.3 names tyrsenus son of heracles by the lydian woman
all three heroic ancestors indicate a lydian dynasty claiming heracles as their ancestor herodotus 1.7 refers to a heraclid dynasty of kings who ruled lydia yet were perhaps not descended from omphale he also mentions 1.94 the recurring legend that the etruscan civilization was founded by colonists from lydia led by tyrrhenus brother of lydus however dionysius of halicarnassus was skeptical of this story indicating that the etruscan language and customs were known to be totally dissimilar to those of the lydians later chronographers also ignored herodotuss statement that agron was the first to be a king and included alcaeus belus and ninus in their list of kings of lydia strabo 5.2.2 makes atys father of lydus and tyrrhenus to be a descendant of heracles and omphale all other accounts name atys lydus and tyrrhenus as being among the pre-heraclid kings of lydia the gold deposits in the river pactolus that were the source of the proverbial wealth of croesus lydias last king were said to have been left there when the legendary king midas of phrygia washed away the midas touch in its waters in euripides tragedy the bacchae dionysus while he is maintaining his human disguise declares his country to be lydia


 first coinage 

according to herodotus the lydians were the first people to use gold and silver coins and the first to establish retail shops in permanent locations it is not known however whether herodotus meant that the lydians were the first to use coins of pure gold and pure silver or the first precious metal coins in general despite this ambiguity this statement of herodotus is one of the pieces of evidence most often cited on behalf of the argument that lydians invented coinage at least in the west even though the first coins were neither gold nor silver but an alloy of the two called electrum
the dating of these first stamped coins is one of the most frequently debated topics of ancient numismatics with dates ranging from 700 bce to 550 bce but the most common opinion is that they were minted at or near the beginning of the reign of king alyattes sometimes referred to incorrectly as alyattes ii who ruled lydia c 610-550 bce the first coins were made of electrum an alloy of gold and silver that occurs naturally but that was further debased by the lydians with added silver and copper
the largest of these coins are commonly referred to as a 1/3 stater trite denomination weighing around 4.7 grams though no full staters of this type have ever been found and the 1/3 stater probably should be referred to more correctly as a stater after a type of a transversely held scale the weights used in such a scale from ancient greek ίστημιto stand which also means standard these coins were stamped with a lions head adorned with what is likely a sunburst which was the kings symbol the most prolific mint for early electrum coins was sardis which produced large quantities of the lion head thirds sixths and twelfths along with lion paw fractions to complement the largest denomination fractions were made including a hekte sixth hemihekte twelfth and so forth down to a 96th with the 1/96 stater weighing only about 0.15 grams there is disagreement however over whether the fractions below the twelfth are actually lydian it took some time before ancient coins were used for commerce and trade even the smallest-denomination electrum coins perhaps worth about a days subsistence would have been too valuable for buying a loaf of bread

the first coins to be used for retailing on a large-scale basis were likely small silver fractions hemiobol ancient greek coinage minted by the ionian greeks in the late sixth century bce
alyattes son was croesus who became associated with great wealth sardis was renowned as a beautiful city around 550 bce near the beginning of his reign croesus paid for the construction of the temple of artemis at ephesus which became one of the seven wonders of the ancient world croesus was defeated in battle by cyrus ii of persia in 546 bce with the lydian kingdom losing its autonomy and becoming a persian satrapy


 autochthonous dynasties 

lydia was ruled by three dynasties
atyads 1300 bce or earlier – heraclids tylonids to 687 bce
according to herodotuse the heraclids ruled for 22 generations during the period from 1185 bce lasting for 505 years alyattes was the king of lydia in 776 bce the last king of this dynasty was myrsilos or candaules
candaules - after ruling for seventeen years he was assassinated by his former friend gyges who succeeded him on the throne of lydia
mermnads
gyges called gugu of luddu in assyrian inscriptions 687-652 bce or 690-657 bce - once established on the throne gyges devoted himself to consolidating his kingdom and making it a military power the capital was relocated from hyde to sardis barbarian cimmerians sacked many lydian cities except for sardis gyges was the son of dascylus who when recalled from banishment in cappadocia by the lydian king myrsilos—called candaules the dog-strangler a title of the lydian hermes by the greeks—sent his son back to lydia instead of himself gyges turned to egypt sending his faithful carian troops along with ionian mercenaries to assist psammetichus in ending assyrian domination some bible scholars believe that gyges of lydia was the biblical character gog ruler of magog who is mentioned in the book of ezekiel and the book of revelation
ardys ii 652-621 bce
sadyattes 621-609 bce or 624-610 bce - herodotus wrote in his inquiries that he fought with cyaxares the descendant of deioces and with the medes drove out the cimmerians from asia captured smyrna which had been founded by colonists from colophon and invaded the city-states clazomenae and miletus
alyattes ii 609 or 619-560 bce - one of the greatest kings of lydia when cyaxares attacked lydia the kings of cilicia and babylon intervened and negotiated a peace in 585 bce whereby the river halys was established as the medes frontier with lydia herodotus writes
on the refusal of alyattes to give up his supplicants when cyaxares sent to demand them of him war broke out between the lydians and the medes and continued for five years with various success in the course of it the medes gained many victories over the lydians and the lydians also gained many victories over the medes
the battle of the eclipse was the final battle in a five year war between alyattes ii of lydia and cyaxares of the medes it took place on may 28 585 bce and ended abruptly due to a total solar eclipse
croesus 560-546 bce - the expression rich as croesus refers to this king the lydian empire ended when croesus attacked the persian empire of cyrus ii and was defeated in 546 bce


 persian empire 

in 547 bce the lydian king croesus besieged and captured the persian city of pteria in cappadocia and enslaved its inhabitants the persian king cyrus the great marched with his army against the lydians the battle of pteria resulted in a stalemate forcing the lydians to retreat to their capital city of sardis some months later the persian and lydian kings met at the battle of thymbra cyrus won and captured the capital city of sardis by 546 bc lydia became a province satrapy of the persian empire


 hellenistic empire 
lydia remained a satrapy after persias conquest by the macedonian king alexander iii the great of macedon
when alexanders empire ended after his death lydia was possessed by the major asian diadoch dynasty the seleucids and when it was unable to maintain its territory in asia minor lydia was acquired by the attalid dynasty of pergamum its last king avoided the spoils and ravage of a roman war of conquest by leaving the realm by testament to the roman empire


 roman province of asia 

when the romans entered the capital sardis in 133 bce lydia as the other western parts of the attalid legacy became part of the province of asia a very rich roman province worthy of a governor with the high rank of proconsul the whole west of asia minor had jewish colonies very early and christianity was also soon present there acts of the apostles 1614-15 mentions the baptism of a merchant woman called lydia from thyatira known as lydia of thyatira in what had once been the satrapy of lydia christianity spread rapidly during the 3rd century ce based on the nearby exarchate of ephesus


 roman province of lydia 
under the tetrarchy reform of emperor diocletian in 296 ce lydia was revived as the name of a separate roman province much smaller than the former satrapy with its capital at sardis
together with the provinces of caria hellespontus lycia pamphylia phrygia prima and phrygia secunda pisidia all in modern turkey and the insulae ionian islands mostly in modern greece it formed the diocese under a vicarius of asiana which was part of the praetorian prefecture of oriens together with the dioceses pontiana most of the rest of asia minor oriens proper mainly syria aegyptus egypt and thraciae on the balkans roughly bulgaria


 byzantine and crusader age 
under the byzantine emperor heraclius 610-641 lydia became part of anatolikon one of the original themata and later of thrakesion although the seljuk turks conquered most of the rest of anatolia forming the sultanate of ikonion konya lydia remained part of the byzantine empire during the occupation of constantinople in the fourth crusade lydia continued to be a part of the byzantine orthodox greek empire based at nicaea


 under turkish rule 
lydia was captured finally by turkish beyliks which were all absorbed by the ottoman state in 1390 the area became part of the ottoman aidin vilayet province and is now in the modern republic of turkey


 christianity 
lydia had numerous christian communities and after christianity became the official religion of the roman empire in the 4th century lydia became one of the provinces of the diocese of asia in the patriarchate of constantinople
the ecclesiastical province of lydia had a metropolitan diocese at sardis and suffragan dioceses for philadelphia thyatira tripolis settae gordus tralles silandus maeonia apollonos hierum mostene apollonias attalia hyrcania bage balandus hermocapella hierocaesarea acrassus dalda stratonicia cerasa gabala satala aureliopolis and hellenopolis bishops from the various dioceses of lydia were well represented at the council of nicaea in 325 and at the later ecumenical councils
