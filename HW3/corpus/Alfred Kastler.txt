alfred kastler french kastlɛʁ 3 may 1902 – 7 january 1984 was a french physicist and nobel prize laureate


 biography 
kastler was born in guebwiller alsace german empire and later attended the lycée bartholdi in colmar alsace and école normale supérieure in paris in 1921 after his studies in 1926 he began teaching physics at the lycée of mulhouse and then taught at the university of bordeaux where he was a university professor until 1941 georges bruhat asked him to come back to the école normale supérieure where he finally obtained a chair in 1952
collaborating with jean brossel he researched quantum mechanics the interaction between light and atoms and spectroscopy kastler working on combination of optical resonance and magnetic resonance developed the technique of optical pumping those works led to the completion of the theory of lasers and masers
he won the nobel prize in physics in 1966 for the discovery and development of optical methods for studying hertzian resonances in atoms
he was president of the board of the institut doptique théorique et appliquée and served as the first chairman of the non-governmental organization ngo action against hunger
kastler also wrote poetry in german in 1971 he published europe ma patrie deutsche lieder eines französischen europäers ie europe my fatherland german songs of a french european

over the forty years that followed this group has trained many of young physicists and had a significant impact on the development of the science of atomic physics in france the laboratoire de spectroscopie hertzienne has then been renamed laboratoire kastler-brossel in 1994 and has got a part of its laboratory in université pierre et marie curie mainly at the école normale supérieure
professor kastler died on 7 january 1984 in bandol france
