this list of solar eclipses seen from china describes precise visibility information for solar eclipses and major cities in china
a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between earth and the sun thereby obscuring earths view of the sun eclipses can be total annular or partial the zone of a total eclipse where the sky appears dark is often just a few miles wide this is known as the path of totality
an eclipse that is visible from asia in general terms might not be visible at all at a specific location eg parts of sri lanka may fall into darkness for a few seconds people in indonesia india and pakistan enjoy the partial eclipse and beijing may be too far away to fall under the moons shadow
occasionally a major city lies in the direct path of an annular or total eclipse which is of great interest to astronomy buffs â€“ some people make travel arrangements years in advance to observe eclipses nearly two-thirds of the earths surface is covered by oceans thus a total eclipse at a major metropolitan area where hotels and amenities are available is an event of considerable interest
