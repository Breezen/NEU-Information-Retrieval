the river thames   listen temz is a river that flows through southern england most notably through london at 215 miles 346 km it is the longest river entirely in england and the second longest in the united kingdom after the river severn it also flows through oxford where it is called isis reading henley-on-thames and windsor the lower reaches of the river are called the tideway derived from its long tidal reach up to teddington lock it rises at thames head in gloucestershire and flows into the north sea via the thames estuary the thames drains the whole of greater london
its tidal section reaching up to teddington lock includes most of its london stretch and has a rise and fall of 7 metres 23 ft running through some of the driest parts of mainland britain and heavily abstracted for drinking water the thames discharge is low considering its length and breadth the severn has a discharge almost twice as large on average despite having a smaller drainage basin in scotland the tay achieves more than double the average discharge from a drainage basin that is 60% smaller
along its course are 45 navigation locks with accompanying weirs its catchment area covers a large part of south eastern and a small part of western england and the river is fed by 38 named tributaries the river contains over 80 islands with its waters varying from freshwater to almost seawater the thames supports a variety of wildlife and has a number of adjoining sites of special scientific interest with the largest being in the remaining parts of the north kent marshes and covering 5,449 hectares 13,460 acres
in 2010 the thames won the largest environmental award in the world – the 350,000 international riverprize


 etymology 

the thames from middle english temese is derived from the brittonic celtic name for the river tamesas from tamēssa recorded in latin as tamesis and yielding modern welsh tafwys thames the name may have meant dark and can be compared to other cognates such as russian темно proto-slavic tĭmĭnŭ latvian tumsa darkness sanskrit tamas and welsh tywyll darkness proto-celtic temeslos and middle irish teimen dark grey the same origin is shared by countless other river names spread across britain such as the river tamar at the border of devon and cornwall several rivers named tame in the midlands and north yorkshire the tavy on dartmoor the team of the north east the teifi and teme of wales the teviot in the scottish borders as well as one of the thames tributaries called the thame
kenneth h jackson has proposed that the name of the thames is not indo-european and of unknown meaning while peter kitson suggested that it is indo-european but originated before the celts and has a name indicating muddiness from a root tā- melt
indirect evidence for the antiquity of the name thames is provided by a roman potsherd found at oxford bearing the inscription tamesubugus fecit tamesubugus made this it is believed that tamesubugus name was derived from that of the river tamese was referred to as a place not a river in the ravenna cosmography cad 700
the rivers name has always been pronounced with a simple t t the middle english spelling was typically temese and the brittonic form tamesis a similar spelling from 1210 tamisiam is found in the magna carta
the th spelling lends an air of greek to the name and was added during the renaissance possibly to reflect or support a claim that the name was derived from the thyamis in epirus from where early celtic-speaking groups were wrongly thought to have migrated to britain
the thames through oxford is sometimes called the isis historically and especially in victorian times gazetteers and cartographers insisted that the entire river was correctly named the isis from its source down to dorchester on thames and that only from this point where the river meets the thame and becomes the thame-isis supposedly subsequently abbreviated to thames should it be so called ordnance survey maps still label the thames as river thames or isis down to dorchester however since the early 20th century this distinction has been lost in common usage outside of oxford and some historians suggest the name isis is nothing more than a truncation of tamesis the latin name for the thames
richard coates suggests that while the river was as a whole called the thames part of it where it was too wide to ford was called plowonida this gave the name to a settlement on its banks which became known as londinium from the indo-european roots pleu- flow and -nedi river meaning something like the flowing river or the wide flowing unfordable river
for merchant seamen the thames has long been just the london river londoners often refer to it simply as the river in expressions such as south of the river
the river gives its name to three informal areas the thames valley a region of england around the river between oxford and west london the thames gateway and the greatly overlapping thames estuary around the tidal thames to the east of london and including the waterway itself thames valley police is a formal body that takes its name from the river covering three counties the administrative powers of the thames conservancy have been taken on with modifications by the environment agency and in respect of the tideway part of the river such powers are split between the agency and the port of london authority in non-administrative use stemming directly from the river and its name are thames valley university thames water thames television productions thames  hudson publishing thameslink north-south railways passing through central london and south thames college historic entities include the thames ironworks and shipbuilding company


 administration 
the administrative powers of the thames conservancy have been taken on with modifications by the environment agency and in respect of the tideway part of the river such powers are split between the agency and the port of london authority


 human activity 
the marks of human activity in some cases dating back to pre-roman britain are visible at various points along the river these include a variety of structures connected with use of the river such as navigations bridges and watermills as well as prehistoric burial mounds a major maritime route is formed for much of its length for shipping and supplies through the port of london for international trade internally along its length and by its connection to the british canal system the rivers position has put it at the centre of many events in british history leading to it being described by john burns as liquid history
two broad canals link the river to other river basins the kennet and avon canal reading to bath and the grand union canal london to the midlands the grand union effectively bypassed the earlier narrow and winding oxford canal which also remains open as a popular scenic recreational route three further cross-basin canals are disused but are in various stages of reconstruction the thames and severn canal via stroud which operated until 1927 to the west coast of england the wey and arun canal to littlehampton which operated until 1871 to the south coast and the wilts and berks canal
rowing and sailing clubs are common along the thames which is navigable to such vessels kayaking and canoeing also take place major annual events include the henley royal regatta and the boat race while the thames has been used during two summer olympic games 1908 rowing1948 rowing and canoeing safe headwaters and reaches are a summer venue for organised swimming which is prohibited on safety grounds in a stretch centred on central london


 physical and natural aspects 

the usually quoted source of the thames is at thames head at grid reference st980994 this is about 3⁄4 mile 1.2 km north of kemble parish church in southern gloucestershire near the town of cirencester in the cotswolds
however seven springs near cheltenham where the churn which feeds into the thames near cricklade rises is also sometimes quoted as the thames source as this location is furthest from the mouth and adds some 14 miles 23 km to the length at seven springs above the source is a stone with the latin hexameter inscription hic tuus o tamesine pater septemgeminus fons which means here o father thames is your sevenfold source
the springs at seven springs flow throughout the year while those at thames head are only seasonal a winterbourne the thames is the longest river entirely in england but the river severn which is partly in wales is the longest river in the united kingdom as the river churn sourced at seven springs is 14 miles 23 km longer than the thames from its traditional source at thames head to the confluence the overall length of the thames measured from seven springs 229 miles 369 km is greater than the severns length 220 miles 350 km thus the churnthames river may be regarded as the longest natural river in the united kingdom
the stream from seven springs is joined at coberley by a longer tributary which could further increase the length of the thames with its source in the grounds of the national star college at ullenwood
the thames flows through or alongside ashton keynes cricklade lechlade oxford abingdon-on-thames wallingford goring-on-thames and streatley pangbourne and whitchurch-on-thames reading wargrave henley-on-thames marlow maidenhead windsor and eton staines-upon-thames and egham chertsey shepperton weybridge sunbury-on-thames walton-on-thames molesey and thames ditton the river was subject to minor redefining and widening of the main channel around oxford abingdon and marlow before 1850 since when further cuts to ease navigation have reduced distances further
molesey faces hampton london and in greater london the thames passes hampton court palace surbiton kingston upon thames teddington twickenham richmond with a famous view of the thames from richmond hill syon house kew brentford chiswick barnes hammersmith fulham putney wandsworth battersea and chelsea in central london the river passes pimlico and vauxhall and then forms one of the principal axes of the city from the palace of westminster to the tower of london at this point it historically formed the southern boundary of the medieval city with southwark on the opposite bank then being part of surrey
beyond central london the river passes bermondsey wapping shadwell limehouse rotherhithe millwall deptford greenwich cubitt town blackwall new charlton and silvertown before flowing through the thames barrier which protects central london from flooding by storm surges below the barrier the river passes woolwich thamesmead dagenham erith purfleet dartford west thurrock northfleet tilbury and gravesend before entering the thames estuary near southend-on-sea


 sea level 
sediment cores up to 10 m deep collected by the british geological survey from the banks of the tidal river thames contain geochemical information and fossils which provide a 10,000-year record of sea-level change combined this and other studies suggest that the thames sea-level has risen more than 30 m during the holocene at a rate of around 5–6 mm per year from 10,000 to 6,000 years ago the rise of sea level dramatically reduced when the ice melt nearly concluded over the past 4,000 years since the beginning of the 20th century rates of sea level rise range from 1.22 mm per year to 2.14 mm per year


 catchment area and discharge 

the thames river basin district including the medway catchment covers an area of 6,229 square miles 16,130 km2 the river basin includes both rural and heavily urbanised areas in the east and northern parts while the western parts of the catchment are predominantly rural the area is among the driest in the united kingdom water resources consist of groundwater from aquifers and water taken from the thames and its tributaries much of it stored in large bank-side reservoirs
the thames itself provides two-thirds of londons drinking water while groundwater supplies about 40 per cent of public water supplies in the total catchment area groundwater is an important water source especially in the drier months so maintaining its quality and quantity is extremely important groundwater is vulnerable to surface pollution especially in highly urbanised areas


 the non-tidal section 

brooks canals and rivers within an area of 3,842 square miles 9,951 km2 combine to form 38 main tributaries feeding the thames between its source and teddington lock this is the usual tidal limit however high spring tides can raise the head water level in the reach above teddington and can occasionally reverse the river flow for a short time in these circumstances tidal effects can be observed upstream to the next lock beside molesey weir which is visible from the towpath and bridge beside hampton court palace before teddington lock was built in 1810–12 the river was tidal at peak spring tides as far as staines upon thames
in descending order non-related tributaries of the non-tidal thames with river status are the churn leach cole ray coln windrush evenlode cherwell ock thame pang kennet loddon colne wey and mole in addition there are occasional backwaters and artificial cuts that form islands distributaries most numerous in the case of the colne and man-made distributaries such as the longford river three canals intersect this stretch the oxford canal kennet and avon canal and wey navigation
its longest artificial secondary channel cut the jubilee river was built between maidenhead and windsor for flood relief and completed in 2002
the non-tidal section of the river is owned and managed by the environment agency which is responsible for managing the flow of water to help prevent and mitigate flooding and providing for navigation the volume and speed of water downstream is managed by adjusting the sluices at each of the weirs and at peak high water levels are generally dissipated over preferred flood plains adjacent to the river occasionally flooding of inhabited areas is unavoidable and the agency issues flood warnings due to stiff penalties applicable on the non-tidal river which is a drinking water source before treatment sanitary sewer overflow from the many sewage treatment plants covering the upper thames basin is rare in the non-tidal thames which ensures clearer water compared to the rivers tideway


 the tidal section 

below teddington lock about 55 miles or 89 kilometres upstream of the thames estuary the river is subject to tidal activity from the north sea before the lock was installed the river was tidal as far as staines about 16 miles 26 km upstream london capital of roman britain was established on two hills now known as cornhill and ludgate hill these provided a firm base for a trading centre at the lowest possible point on the thames
a river crossing was built at the site of london bridge london bridge is now used as the basis for published tide tables giving the times of high tide high tide reaches putney about 30 minutes later than london bridge and teddington about an hour later the tidal stretch of the river is known as the tideway tide tables are published by the port of london authority and are available online times of high and low tides are also posted on twitter
the principal tributaries of the river thames on the tideway include the rivers brent wandle effra westbourne fleet ravensbourne the final part of which is called deptford creek lea roding darent and ingrebourne at london the water is slightly brackish with sea salt being a mix of sea and fresh water
this part of the river is managed by the port of london authority the flood threat here comes from high tides and strong winds from the north sea and the thames barrier was built in the 1980s to protect london from this risk


 islands 

the river thames contains over 80 islands ranging from the large estuarial marshlands of the isle of sheppey and canvey island to small tree-covered islets like rose isle in oxfordshire and headpile eyot in berkshire they are found all the way from the isle of sheppey in kent to fiddlers island in oxfordshire some of the largest inland islands for example formosa island near cookham and andersey island at abingdon were created naturally when the course of the river divided into separate streams
in the oxford area the river splits into several streams across the floodplain seacourt stream castle mill stream bulstake stream and others creating several islands fiddlers island osney and others desborough island ham island at old windsor and penton hook island were artificially created by lock cuts and navigation channels chiswick eyot is a familiar landmark on the boat race course while glovers island forms the centrepiece of the spectacular view from richmond hill
islands of historical interest include magna carta island at runnymede frys island at reading and pharaohs island near shepperton in more recent times platts eyot at hampton was the place where motor torpedo boats mtbs were built taggs island near molesey was associated with the impresario fred karno and eel pie island at twickenham was the birthplace of the south easts rb music scene
westminster abbey and the palace of westminster commonly known today as the houses of parliament were built on thorney island which used to be an eyot


 geological and topographic history 

the river thames can first be identified as a discrete drainage line as early as 58 million years ago in the thanetian stage of the late palaeocene epoch until around 500,000 years ago the thames flowed on its existing course through what is now oxfordshire before turning to the north east through hertfordshire and east anglia and reaching the north sea near ipswich
at this time the river system headwaters lay in the english west midlands and may at times have received drainage from the berwyn mountains in north wales brooks and rivers like the river brent colne brook and bollo brook either flowed into the then river thames or went out to sea on the course of the present-day river thames
about 450,000 years ago in the most extreme ice age of the pleistocene the anglian the furthest southern extent of the ice sheet was at hornchurch in east london it dammed the river in hertfordshire resulting in the formation of large ice lakes which eventually burst their banks and caused the river to be diverted onto its present course through what is now london progressively the channel was pushed south to form the st albans depression by the repeated advances of the ice sheet
this created a new river course through berkshire and on into london after which the river rejoined its original course in southern essex near the present river blackwater estuary here it entered a substantial freshwater lake in the southern north sea basin the overspill of this lake caused the formation of the dover strait gap between britain and france subsequent development led to the continuation of the course that the river follows at the present day
most of the bedrock of the vale of aylesbury is made up of clay and chalk that was formed at the end of the ice age and at one time was under the proto-thames also created at this time were the vast underground reserves of water that make the water table higher than average in the vale of aylesbury


 ice age 

the last advance from that scandinavian ice flow to have reached this far south covered much of north west middlesex and finally forced the proto-thames to take roughly its present course at the height of the last ice age around 20,000 bc britain was connected to mainland europe by a large expanse of land known as doggerland in the southern north sea basin at this time the thames course did not continue to doggerland but flowed southwards from the eastern essex coast where it met the rhine the meuse and the scheldt flowing from what are now the netherlands and belgium these rivers formed a single river—the channel river fleuve manche—that passed through the dover strait and drained into the atlantic ocean in the western english channel
the ice sheet which stopped around present day finchley deposited boulder clay to form dollis hill and hanger hill its torrent of meltwater gushed through the finchley gap and south towards the new course of the thames and proceeded to carve out the brent valley in the process upon the valley sides there can be seen other terraces of brickearth laid over and sometimes interlayered with the clays
these deposits were brought in by the winds during the periglacial periods suggesting that wide flat marshes were then part of the landscape which the new river brent proceeded to cut down the steepness of the valley sides is an indicator of the very much lower mean sea levels caused by the glaciation locking up so much water upon the land masses thus causing the river water to flow rapidly seaward and so erode its bed quickly downwards
the original land surface was around 350 to 400 feet 110 to 120 metres above the current sea level the surface had sandy deposits from an ancient sea laid over sedimentary clay this is the blue london clay all the erosion down from this higher land surface and the sorting action by these changes of water flow and direction formed what is known as the thames river gravel terraces
since roman times and perhaps earlier the isostatic rebound from the weight of previous ice sheets and its interplay with the eustatic change in sea level have resulted in the old valley of the river brent together with that of the thames silting up again thus along much of the brents present-day course one can make out the water meadows of rich alluvium which is augmented by frequent floods


 conversion of marshland 
after the river took its present-day course many of the banks of the thames estuary and the thames valley in london were partly covered in marshland as was the adjoining lower lea valley streams and rivers like the river lea tyburn brook and bollo brook drained into the river while some islands eg thorney island formed over the ages the northern tip of the ancient parish of lambeth for example was marshland known as lambeth marshe but it was drained in the 18th century it is remembered in the street name lower marsh
the east end of london also known simply as the east end was the area of london east of the medieval walled city of london and north of the river thames although it is not defined by universally accepted formal boundaries the river lea can be considered another boundary most of the local riverside was also marshland the land was drained and became farmland it was built on after the industrial revolution use of the term east end in a pejorative sense began in the late 19th century
canvey island in southern essex area 18.45 km2 7.12 sq mi population 37,479 was once marshy but is now a fully reclaimed island in the thames estuary it is separated from the mainland of south essex by a network of creeks lying below sea level it is prone to flooding at exceptional tides but has nevertheless been inhabited since roman times


 wildlife 

various species of birds feed off the river or nest on it some being found both at sea and inland these include cormorant black-headed gull and herring gull the mute swan is a familiar sight on the river but the escaped black swan is more rare the annual ceremony of swan upping is an old tradition of counting stocks
non-native geese that can be seen include canada geese egyptian geese and bar-headed geese and ducks include the familiar native mallard plus introduced mandarin duck and wood duck other water birds to be found on the thames include the great crested grebe coot moorhen heron and kingfisher many types of british birds also live alongside the river although they are not specific to the river habitat
the thames contains both sea water and fresh water thus providing support for seawater and freshwater fish however many populations of fish are at risk and are being killed in tens of thousands because of pollutants leaking into the river from human activities salmon which inhabit both environments have been reintroduced and a succession of fish ladders have been built into weirs to enable them to travel upstream
on 5 august 1993 the largest non-tidal salmon in recorded history was caught close to boulters lock in maidenhead the specimen weighed 14 1⁄2 pounds 6.6 kg and measured 22 inches 56 cm in length the eel is particularly associated with the thames and there were formerly many eel traps freshwater fish of the thames and its tributaries include brown trout chub dace roach barbel perch pike bleak and flounder colonies of short-snouted seahorses have also recently been discovered in the river the thames is also host to some invasive crustaceans including the signal crayfish and the chinese mitten crab
aquatic mammals are also known to inhabit the thames the population of grey and harbour seals numbers up to 700 in the thames estuary these animals have been sighted as far upriver as richmond bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises are also sighted in the thames
on 20 january 2006 a 16–18 ft 4.9–5.5 m northern bottle-nosed whale was seen in the thames as far upstream as chelsea this was extremely unusual this whale is generally found in deep sea waters crowds gathered along the riverbanks to witness the extraordinary spectacle but there was soon concern as the animal came within yards of the banks almost beaching and crashed into an empty boat causing slight bleeding about 12 hours later the whale is believed to have been seen again near greenwich possibly heading back to sea a rescue attempt lasted several hours but the whale died on a barge see river thames whale


 human history 

the river thames has played several roles in human history as an economic resource a maritime route a boundary a fresh water source a source of food and more recently a leisure facility in 1929 john burns one-time mp for battersea responded to an americans unfavourable comparison of the thames with the mississippi by coining the expression the thames is liquid history
there is evidence of human habitation living off the river along its length dating back to neolithic times the british museum has a decorated bowl 3300–2700 bc found in the river at hedsor buckinghamshire and a considerable amount of material was discovered during the excavations of dorney lake a number of bronze age sites and artefacts have been discovered along the banks of the river including settlements at lechlade cookham and sunbury-on-thames
so extensive have the changes to this landscape been that what little evidence there is of mans presence before the ice came has inevitably shown signs of transportation here by water and reveals nothing specifically local likewise later evidence of occupation even since the arrival of the romans may lie next to the original banks of the brent but have been buried under centuries of silt


 roman britain 
some of the earliest written references to the thames latin tamesis occur in julius caesars account of his second expedition to britain in 54 bc when the thames presented a major obstacle and he encountered the iron age belgic tribes the catuvellauni and the atrebates along the river the confluence of the thames and cherwell was the site of early settlements and the river cherwell marked the boundary between the dobunni tribe to the west and the catuvellauni tribe to the east these were pre-roman celtic tribes in the late 1980s a large romano-british settlement was excavated on the edge of the village of ashton keynes in wiltshire
in ad 43 under the emperor claudius the romans occupied england and recognising the rivers strategic and economic importance built fortifications along the thames valley including a major camp at dorchester cornhill and ludgate hill provided a defensible site near a point on the river both deep enough for the eras ships and narrow enough to be bridged londinium london grew up around the walbrook on the north bank around the year 47 boudicas iceni razed the settlement in ad 60 or 61 but it was soon rebuilt and following the completion of its bridge it grew to become the provincial capital of the island
the next roman bridges upstream were at staines on the devils highway between londinium and calleva silchester boats could be swept up to it on the rising tide with no need for wind or muscle power


 middle ages 
a romano-british settlement grew up north of the confluence partly because the site was naturally protected from attack on the east side by the river cherwell and on the west by the river thames this settlement dominated the pottery trade in what is now central southern england and pottery was distributed by boats on the thames and its tributaries
competition for the use of the river created the centuries-old conflict between those who wanted to dam the river to build millraces and fish traps and those who wanted to travel and carry goods on it economic prosperity and the foundation of wealthy monasteries by the anglo-saxons attracted unwelcome visitors and by around ad 870 the vikings were sweeping up the thames on the tide and creating havoc as in their destruction of chertsey abbey

once king william had won total control of the strategically important thames valley he went on to invade the rest of england he had many castles built including those at wallingford rochester windsor and most importantly the tower of london many details of thames activity are recorded in the domesday book the following centuries saw the conflict between king and barons coming to a head in ad 1215 when king john was forced to sign the magna carta on an island in the thames at runnymede among a host of other things this granted the barons the right of navigation under clause 23
another major consequence of johns reign was the completion of the multi-piered london bridge which acted as a barricade and barrage on the river affecting the tidal flow upstream and increasing the likelihood of the river freezing over in tudor and stuart times various kings and queens built magnificent riverside palaces at hampton court kew richmond on thames whitehall and greenwich
as early as the 1300s the thames was used to dispose of waste matter produced in the city of london thus turning the river into an open sewer in 1357 edward iii described the state of the river in a proclamation dung and other filth had accumulated in divers places upon the banks of the river with fumes and other abominable stenches arising therefrom
the growth of the population of london greatly increased the amount of waste that entered the river including human excrement animal waste from slaughter houses and waste from manufacturing processes according to historian peter ackroyd a public lavatory on london bridge showered its contents directly onto the river below and latrines were built over all the tributaries that issued into the thames


 early modern period 

during a series of cold winters the thames froze over above london bridge in the first frost fair in 1607 a tent city was set up on the river along with a number of amusements including ice bowling
in good conditions barges travelled daily from oxford to london carrying timber wool foodstuffs and livestock the stone from the cotswolds used to rebuild st pauls cathedral after the great fire in 1666 was brought all the way down from radcot the thames provided the major route between the city of london and westminster in the 16th and 17th centuries the clannish guild of watermen ferried londoners from landing to landing and tolerated no outside interference in 1715 thomas doggett was so grateful to a local waterman for his efforts in ferrying him home pulling against the tide that he set up a rowing race for professional watermen known as doggetts coat and badge

by the 18th century the thames was one of the worlds busiest waterways as london became the centre of the vast mercantile british empire and progressively over the next century the docks expanded in the isle of dogs and beyond efforts were made to resolve the navigation conflicts upstream by building locks along the thames after temperatures began to rise again starting in 1814 the river stopped freezing over the building of a new london bridge in 1825 with fewer piers pillars than the old allowed the river to flow more freely and prevented it from freezing over in cold winters
throughout early modern history the population of london and its industries discarded their rubbish in the river this included the waste from slaughterhouses fish markets and tanneries the buildup in household cesspools could sometimes overflow especially when it rained and was washed into londons streets and sewers which eventually led to the thames in the late 18th and 19th centuries people known as mudlarks scavenged in the river mud for a meagre living


 victorian era 

in the 19th century the quality of water in thames deteriorated further the dumping of raw sewage into the thames was formerly only common in the city of london making its tideway a harbour for many harmful bacteria gas manufactories were built alongside the river and their by-products leaked into the water including spent lime ammonia cyanide and carbolic acid the river had an unnaturally warm temperature caused by chemical reactions in the water which also removed the waters oxygen four serious cholera outbreaks killed tens of thousands of people between 1832 and 1865 historians have attributed prince alberts death in 1861 to typhoid that had spread in the rivers dirty waters beside windsor castle wells with water tables that mixed with tributaries or the non-tidal thames faced such pollution with the widespread installation of the flush toilet in the 1850s in the great stink of 1858 pollution in the river reached such an extreme that sittings of the house of commons at westminster had to be abandoned chlorine-soaked drapes were hung in the windows of parliament in an attempt to stave off the smell of the river but to no avail
a concerted effort to contain the citys sewage by constructing massive sewer systems on the north and south river embankments followed under the supervision of engineer joseph bazalgette meanwhile similar huge undertakings took place to ensure the water supply with the building of reservoirs and pumping stations on the river to the west of london slowly helping the quality of water to improve
the victorian era was one of imaginative engineering the coming of the railways added railway bridges to the earlier road bridges and also reduced commercial activity on the river however sporting and leisure use increased with the establishment of regattas such as henley and the boat race on 3 september 1878 one of the worst river disasters in england took place when the crowded pleasure boat princess alice collided with the bywell castle killing over 640 people


 20th century 

the growth of road transport and the decline of the empire in the years following 1914 reduced the economic prominence of the river during the second world war the protection of certain thames-side facilities particularly docks and water treatment plants was crucial to the munitions and water supply of the country the rivers defences included the maunsell forts in the estuary and the use of barrage balloons to counter german bombers using the reflectivity and shapes of the river to navigate during the blitz
in the post-war era although the port of london remains one of the uks three main ports most trade has moved downstream from central london in the late 1950s the discharge of methane gas in the depths of the river caused the water to bubble and the toxins wore away at boats propellers
the decline of heavy industry and tanneries reduced use of oil-pollutants and improved sewage treatment have led to much better water quality as compared with the late 19th and early- to mid-20th centuries and aquatic life has returned to its formerly dead stretches
alongside the entire river runs the thames path a national route for walkers and cyclists
in the early 1980s a pioneering flood control device the thames barrier was opened it is closed to tides several times a year to prevent water damage to londons low-lying areas upstream the 1928 thames flood demonstrated the severity of this type of event
in the late 1990s the 7-mile 11 km long jubilee river was built as a wide naturalistic flood relief channel from taplow to eton to help reduce the flood risk in maidenhead windsor and eton


 the active river 

one of the major resources provided by the thames is the water distributed as drinking water by thames water whose area of responsibility covers the length of the river thames the thames water ring main is the main distribution mechanism for water in london with one major loop linking the hampton walton ashford and kempton park water treatment works with central london
in the past commercial activities on the thames included fishing particularly eel trapping coppicing willows and osiers which provided wood and the operation of watermills for flour and paper production and metal beating these activities have disappeared a screw turbine hydro-electric plant at romney lock to power windsor castle using two archimedes screws was opened in 2013 by the queen
the thames is popular for a wide variety of riverside housing including high-rise flats in central london and chalets on the banks and islands upstream some people live in houseboats typically around brentford and taggs island


 transport and tourism 


 the tidal river 

in london there are many sightseeing tours in tourist boats past the more famous riverside attractions such as the houses of parliament and the tower of london as well as regular riverboat services co-ordinated by london river services london city airport is situated on the thames in east london previously it was a dock


 the upper river 
in summer passenger services operate along the entire non-tidal river from oxford to teddington the two largest operators are salters steamers and french brothers salters operate services between folly bridge oxford and staines the whole journey takes 4 days and requires several changes of boat french brothers operate passenger services between maidenhead and hampton court along the course of the river a number of smaller private companies also offer river trips at oxford wallingford reading and hampton court many companies also provide boat hire on the river
the leisure navigation and sporting activities on the river have given rise to a number of businesses including boatbuilding marinas ships chandlers and salvage services


 aerial lift 

the air line aerial cable system over the thames from the greenwich peninsula to the royal docks has been in operation since the 2012 summer olympics


 police and lifeboats 
the river is policed by five police forces the thames division is the river police arm of londons metropolitan police while surrey police thames valley police essex police and kent police have responsibilities on their parts of the river outside the metropolitan area there is also a london fire brigade fire boat on the river the river claims a number of lives each year
as a result of the marchioness disaster in 1989 when 51 people died the government asked the maritime and coastguard agency the port of london authority and the royal national lifeboat institution rnli to work together to set up a dedicated search and rescue service for the tidal river thames as a result there are four lifeboat stations on the river thames at teddington teddington lifeboat station chiswick chiswick lifeboat station victoria embankmentwaterloo bridge tower lifeboat station and gravesend gravesend lifeboat station


 navigation 

the thames is maintained for navigation by powered craft from the estuary as far as lechlade in gloucestershire and for very small craft to cricklade from teddington lock to the head of navigation the navigation authority is the environment agency between the sea and teddington lock the river forms part of the port of london and navigation is administered by the port of london authority both the tidal river through london and the non-tidal river upstream are intensively used for leisure navigation
the non-tidal river thames is divided into reaches by the 45 locks the locks are staffed for the greater part of the day but can be operated by experienced users out of hours this part of the thames links to existing navigations at the river wey navigation the river kennet and the oxford canal all craft using it must be licensed the environment agency has patrol boats named after tributaries of the thames and can enforce the limit strictly since river traffic usually has to pass through a lock at some stage a speed limit of 8 kmh 4.3 kn applies there are pairs of transit markers at various points along the non-tidal river that can be used to check speed – a boat travelling legally taking a minute or more to pass between the two markers
the tidal river is navigable to large ocean-going ships as far upstream as the pool of london and london bridge although londons upstream enclosed docks have closed and central london sees only the occasional visiting cruise ship or warship the tidal river remains one of britains main ports around 60 active terminals cater for shipping of all types including ro-ro ferries cruise liners and vessels carrying containers vehicles timber grain paper crude oil petroleum products liquified petroleum gas etc there is a regular traffic of aggregate or refuse vessels operating from wharves in the west of london the tidal thames links to the canal network at the river lea navigation the regents canal at limehouse basin and the grand union canal at brentford
upstream of wandsworth bridge a speed limit of 8 knots 15 kmh is in force for powered craft to protect the riverbank environment and to provide safe conditions for rowers and other river users there is no absolute speed limit on most of the tideway downstream of wandsworth bridge although boats are not allowed to create undue wash powered boats are limited to 12 knots between lambeth bridge and downstream of tower bridge with some exceptions boats can be approved by the harbour master to travel at speeds of up to 30 knots from below tower bridge to past the thames barrier


 history of the management of the river 
in the middle ages the crown exercised general jurisdiction over the thames one of the four royal rivers and appointed water bailiffs to oversee the river upstream of staines the city of london exercised jurisdiction over the tidal thames however navigation was increasingly impeded by weirs and mills and in the 14th century the river probably ceased to be navigable for heavy traffic between henley and oxford in the late 16th century the river seems to have been reopened for navigation from henley to burcot
the first commission concerned with the management of the river was the oxford-burcot commission formed in 1605 to make the river navigable between burcot and oxford
in 1751 the thames navigation commission was formed to manage the whole non-tidal river above staines the city of london long claimed responsibility for the tidal river a long running dispute between the city and the crown over ownership of the river was not settled until 1857 when the thames conservancy was formed to manage the river from staines downstream in 1866 the functions of the thames navigation commission were transferred to the thames conservancy which thus had responsibility for the whole river
in 1909 the powers of the thames conservancy over the tidal river below teddington were transferred to the port of london authority
in 1974 the thames conservancy became part of the new thames water authority when thames water was privatised in 1990 its river management functions were transferred to the national rivers authority in 1996 subsumed into the environment agency
in 2010 the thames won the worlds largest environmental award at the time the 350,000 international riverprize presented at the international riversymposium in perth wa in recognition of the substantial and sustained restoration of the river by many hundreds of organisations and individuals since the 1950s


 the river as a boundary 
until enough crossings were established the river presented a formidable barrier with belgic tribes and anglo-saxon kingdoms being defined by which side of the river they were on when english counties were established their boundaries were partly determined by the thames on the northern bank were the ancient counties of gloucestershire oxfordshire buckinghamshire middlesex and essex on the southern bank were the counties of wiltshire berkshire surrey and kent
the 214 bridges and 17 tunnels that have been built to date have changed the dynamics and made cross-river development and shared responsibilities more practicable in 1965 upon the creation of greater london the london borough of richmond upon thames incorporated the former middlesex and surrey banks spelthorne moved from middlesex to surrey and further changes in 1974 moved some of the boundaries away from the river for example some areas were transferred from berkshire to oxfordshire and from buckinghamshire to berkshire on occasion – for example in rowing – the banks are still referred to by their traditional county names


 crossings 

many of the present-day road bridges are on the site of earlier fords ferries and wooden bridges at swinford bridge a toll bridge there was first a ford and then a ferry prior to the bridge being built the earliest known major crossings of the thames by the romans were at london bridge and staines bridge at folly bridge in oxford the remains of an original saxon structure can be seen and medieval stone bridges such as newbridge and abingdon bridge are still in use
kingstons growth is believed to stem from its having the only crossing between london bridge and staines until the beginning of the 18th century during the 18th century many stone and brick road bridges were built from new or to replace existing bridges both in london and along the length of the river these included putney bridge westminster bridge datchet bridge windsor bridge and sonning bridge
several central london road bridges were built in the 19th century most conspicuously tower bridge the only bascule bridge on the river designed to allow ocean-going ships to pass beneath it the most recent road bridges are the bypasses at isis bridge and marlow by-pass bridge and the motorway bridges most notably the two on the m25 route queen elizabeth ii bridge and m25 runnymede bridge
railway development in the 19th century resulted in a spate of bridge building including blackfriars railway bridge and charing cross hungerford railway bridge in central london and the spectacular railway bridges by isambard kingdom brunel at maidenhead railway bridge gatehampton railway bridge and moulsford railway bridge
the worlds first underwater tunnel was marc brunels thames tunnel built in 1843 and now used to carry the east london line the tower subway was the first railway under the thames which was followed by all the deep-level tube lines road tunnels were built in east london at the end of the 19th century being the blackwall tunnel and the rotherhithe tunnel the latest tunnels are the dartford crossings
many foot crossings were established across the weirs that were built on the non-tidal river and some of these remained when the locks were built – for example at benson lock others were replaced by a footbridge when the weir was removed as at harts weir footbridge around 2000 several footbridges were added along the thames either as part of the thames path or in commemoration of the millennium these include temple footbridge bloomers hole footbridge the hungerford footbridges and the millennium bridge all of which have distinctive design characteristics
before bridges were built the main means of crossing the river was by ferry a significant number of ferries were provided specifically for navigation purposes when the towpath changed sides it was necessary to take the towing horse and its driver across the river this was no longer necessary when barges were powered by steam some ferries still operate on the river the woolwich ferry carries cars and passengers across the river in the thames gateway and links the north circular and south circular roads upstream are smaller pedestrian ferries for example hampton ferry and shepperton to weybridge ferry the last being the only non-permanent crossing that remains on the thames path


 pollution 


 treated sewage 
treated sewage from all the towns and villages in the thames catchment flow into the thames via sewage treatment plants this includes all the sewage from swindon oxford reading and windsor
however untreated sewage still regularly enters the thames during wet weather when londons sewerage system was built sewers were designed to overflow through discharge points along the river during heavy storms originally this would happen once or twice a year however overflows now happen once a week on average in 2013 over 55m tonnes of raw sewage was washed into the tidal thames these discharge events kill fish leave raw sewage on the riverbanks and decrease the water quality of the river
to prevent the release of raw sewage and rainwater into the river the thames tideway scheme is currently under construction at a cost of £4.2 billion this project will collect sewage before it overflows before channeling it down a 25 km 15 mi tunnel underneath the tidal thames so it can be treated at beckton sewage treatment works the result of the project will be reduction of sewage discharges into the river by 90 dramatically increasing water quality


 mercury levels 
mercury hg is an environmentally persistent heavy metal which at high concentrations can be toxic to marine life and humans sixty sediment cores of 1 m in depth spanning the entire tidal river thames between brentford and the isle of grain have been analysed for total hg the sediment records show a clear rise and fall of hg pollution through history mercury concentrations in the river thames decrease downstream from london to the outer estuary with the total hg levels ranging from 0.01 to 12.07 mgkg giving a mean of 2.10 mgkg which is higher than many other uk and european river estuaries the highest amount of sedimentary-hosted hg pollution in the thames estuary occurs in the central london area between vauxhall bridge and woolwich the majority of sediment cores show a clear decrease in hg concentrations close to the surface which is attributed to an overall reduction in polluting activities as well as improved effectiveness of recent environmental legalisation and river management eg oslo-paris convention


 natural carbon compounds 
evaluation of select of lipid compounds in the thames estuary known as glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers gdgts has revealed enhanced concentrations of isoprenoid gdgt compounds crenarchaeol around east london this suggests that londons pollution affects the spatial distribution of natural carbon in the river sediments other organic geochemical measurements of carbon flow such as stable carbon isotopes δ13c were found to be insensitive to this urban disturbance


 sport 
there are several watersports prevalent on the thames with many clubs encouraging participation and organising racing and inter-club competitions


 rowing 

the thames is the historic heartland of rowing in the united kingdom there are over 200 clubs on the river and over 8,000 members of british rowing over 40% of its membership most towns and districts of any size on the river have at least one club internationally attended centres are oxford henley-on-thames and events and clubs on the stretch of river from chiswick to putney
two rowing events on the river thames are traditionally part of the wider english sporting calendar
the university boat race between oxford and cambridge takes place in late march or early april on the championship course from putney to mortlake in the west of london
henley royal regatta takes place over five days at the start of july in the upstream town of henley-on-thames besides its sporting significance the regatta is an important date on the english social calendar alongside events like royal ascot and wimbledon
other significant or historic rowing events on the thames include
the head of the river race and womens eights head of the river race 8 ie coxed eights schools head veterans head scullers head fours head hor4s and pairs head shorter on the championship course
the wingfield sculls on the same course 1x single sculling championship
doggetts coat and badge for apprentice watermen of london one of the oldest sporting events in the world
henley womens regatta
the henley boat races currently for the lightweight mens and womens crews of oxford and cambridge universities
the oxford university bumping races known as eights week and torpids
other regattas head races and university bumping races are held along the thames which are described under rowing on the river thames


 sailing 

sailing is practised on both the tidal and non-tidal reaches of the river the highest club upstream is at oxford the most popular sailing craft used on the thames are lasers gp14s and wayfarers one sailing boat unique to the thames is the thames rater which is sailed around ravens ait


 skiffing 
skiffing has dwindled in favour of private motor boat ownership but is competed on the river in the summer months six clubs and a similar number of skiff regattas exist from the skiff club teddington upstream


 punting 
unlike the pleasure punting common on the cherwell in oxford and the cam in cambridge punting on the thames is competitive as well as recreational and uses narrower craft typically based at the few skiff clubs


 kayaking and canoeing 

kayaking and canoeing are common with sea kayakers using the tidal stretch for touring sheltered water kayakers and canoeists use the non-tidal section for training racing and trips whitewater playboaters and slalom paddlers are catered for at weirs like those at hurley lock sunbury lock and boulters lock at teddington just before the tidal section of the river starts is royal canoe club said to be the oldest in the world and founded in 1866 since 1950 almost every year at easter long distance canoeists have been competing in what is now known as the devizes to westminster international canoe race which follows the course of the kennet and avon canal joins the river thames at reading and runs right up to a grand finish at westminster bridge


 swimming 
in 2006 british swimmer and environmental campaigner lewis pugh became the first person to swim the full length of the thames from outside kemble to southend-on-sea to draw attention to the severe drought in england which saw record temperatures indicative of a degree of global warming the 202 miles 325 km swim took him 21 days to complete the official headwater of the river had stopped flowing due to the drought forcing pugh to run the first 26 miles 42 km
since june 2012 the port of london authority has made and enforces a by-law that bans swimming between putney bridge and crossness thamesmead thus including all of central london without obtaining prior permission on the grounds that swimmers in that area of the river endanger not only themselves due to the strong current of the river but also other river users
organised swimming events take place at various points generally upstream of hampton court including windsor marlow and henley in 2011 comedian david walliams swam the 140 miles 230 km from lechlade to westminster bridge and raised over £1 million for charity
in non-tidal stretches swimming was and still is a leisure and fitness activity among experienced swimmers where safe deeper outer channels are used in times of low stream


 meanders 
a thames meander is a long-distance journey over all or part of the thames by running swimming or using any of the above means it is often carried out as an athletic challenge in a competition or for a record attempt

the thames in the arts


 visual arts 
the river thames has been a subject for artists great and minor over the centuries four major artists with works based on the thames are canaletto j m w turner claude monet and james abbott mcneill whistler the 20th century british artist stanley spencer produced many works at cookham
the river is lined with various pieces of sculpture but john kaufmans sculpture the diver regeneration is sited in the thames near rainham
the river and bridges are destroyed - together with much of the city - in the movie independence day 2


 literature 

the thames is mentioned in many works of literature including novels diaries and poetry it is the central theme in three in particular
three men in a boat by jerome k jerome first published in 1889 is a humorous account of a boating holiday on the thames between kingston and oxford the book was intended initially to be a serious travel guide with accounts of local history of places along the route but the humorous elements eventually took over the landscape and features of the thames as described by jerome are virtually unchanged and the books enduring popularity has meant that it has never been out of print since it was first published
charles dickens our mutual friend written in the years 1864–65 describes the river in a grimmer light it begins with a scavenger and his daughter pulling a dead man from the river near london bridge to salvage what the body might have in its pockets and heads to its conclusion with the deaths of the villains drowned in plashwater lock upstream the workings of the river and the influence of the tides are described with great accuracy dickens opens the novel with this sketch of the river and the people who work on it

in these times of ours though concerning the exact year there is no need to be precise a boat of dirty and disreputable appearance with two figures in it floated on the thames between southwark bridge which is of iron and london bridge which is of stone as an autumn evening was closing in the figures in this boat were those of a strong man with ragged grizzled hair and a sun-browned face and a girl of nineteen or twenty the girl rowed pulling a pair of sculls very easily the man with the rudder-lines slack in his hands and his hands loose in his waisteband kept an eager look-out

kenneth grahames the wind in the willows written in 1908 is set in the middle to upper reaches of the river it starts as a tale of anthropomorphic characters simply messing about in boats but develops into a more complex story combining elements of mysticism with adventure and reflection on edwardian society it is generally considered one of the most beloved works of childrens literature and the illustrations by ehshepard and arthur rackham feature the thames and its surroundings
the river almost inevitably features in many books set in london most of dickens other novels include some aspect of the thames oliver twist finishes in the slums and rookeries along its south bank the sherlock holmes stories by arthur conan doyle often visit riverside parts as in the sign of four in heart of darkness by joseph conrad the serenity of the contemporary thames is contrasted with the savagery of the congo river and with the wilderness of the thames as it would have appeared to a roman soldier posted to britannia two thousand years before conrad also gives a description of the approach to london from the thames estuary in his essays the mirror of the sea 1906 upriver henry james portrait of a lady uses a large riverside mansion on the thames as one of its key settings
literary non-fiction works include samuel pepys diary in which he recorded many events relating to the thames including the fire of london he was disturbed while writing it in june 1667 by the sound of gunfire as dutch warships broke through the royal navy on the thames
in poetry william wordsworths sonnet on westminster bridge closes with the lines
neer saw i never felt a calm so deep
the river glideth at his own sweet will
dear god the very houses seem asleep
and all that mighty heart is lying still
t s eliot makes several references to the thames in the fire sermon section iii of the waste land

 major flood events 


 london flood of 1928 

the 1928 thames flood was a disastrous flood of the river thames that affected much of riverside london on 7 january 1928 as well as places further downriver fourteen people were drowned in london and thousands were made homeless when flood waters poured over the top of the thames embankment and part of the chelsea embankment collapsed it was the last major flood to affect central london and particularly following the disastrous north sea flood of 1953 helped lead to the implementation of new flood-control measures that culminated in the construction of the thames barrier in the 1970s


 thames valley flood of 1947 

the 1947 thames flood was worst overall 20th century flood of the river thames affecting much of the thames valley as well as elsewhere in england during the middle of march 1947 after a very severe winter
the floods were caused by 4.6 inches 120 mm of rainfall including snow the peak flow was 61.7 billion litres 13.6 billion imperial gallons of water per day and the damage cost a total of £12 million to repair war damage to some of the locks made matters worse
other significant thames floods since 1947 have occurred in 1968 1993 1998 2000 2003 2006 and 2014


 canvey island flood of 1953 

on the night of 31 january the north sea flood of 1953 devastated the island taking the lives of 58 islanders and led to the temporary evacuation of the 13,000 residents canvey is consequently protected by modern sea defences comprising 15 miles 24 km of concrete seawall many of the victims were in the holiday bungalows of the eastern newlands estate and perished as the water reached ceiling level the small village area of the island is approximately two feet 0.6 m above sea level and consequently escaped the effects of the flood
