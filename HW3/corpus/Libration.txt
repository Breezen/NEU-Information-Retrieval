in astronomy libration is a perceived oscillating motion of orbiting bodies relative to each other notably including the motion of the moon relative to earth or of trojan asteroids relative to planets lunar libration is distinct from the slight changes in the moons apparent size viewed from earth although this appearance can also be described as an oscillating motion it is caused by actual changes in the physical distance of the moon because of its elliptic orbit around earth lunar libration is caused by three phenomena detailed below


 lunar libration 
the moon keeps one hemisphere of itself facing the earth due to tidal locking therefore humans first view of the far side of the moon resulted from lunar exploration on october 7 1959 however this simple picture is only approximately true over time slightly more than half about 59 of the moons surface is seen from earth due to libration
libration is manifested as a slow rocking back and forth of the moon as viewed from earth permitting an observer to see slightly different halves of the surface at different times
there are three types of lunar libration
libration in longitude results from the eccentricity of the moons orbit around earth the moons rotation sometimes leads and sometimes lags its orbital position
libration in latitude results from a slight inclination about 6.7 degrees between the moons axis of rotation and the normal to the plane of its orbit around earth its origin is analogous to how the seasons arise from earths revolution about the sun
diurnal libration is a small daily oscillation due to the earths rotation which carries an observer first to one side and then to the other side of the straight line joining earths and the moons centers allowing the observer to look first around one side of the moon and then around the other—because the observer is on the surface of the earth not at its center


 trojan libration 

in 1772 lagranges analyses determined that small bodies can stably share the same orbit as a planet if they remain near lagrange points which are 60° ahead of or behind the planet in its orbit such ‘trojan asteroids’ have been found co-orbiting with earth jupiter mars and neptune trojan asteroids associated with earth are difficult to observe in the visible spectrum as their libration paths are such that they would be visible primarily in the daylight sky in 2010 however using infrared observation techniques the asteroid 2010 tk7 was found to be a trojan companion of the earth it librates around the leading lagrange point l4 in a stable orbit
