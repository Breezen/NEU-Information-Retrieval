a gravitational lens is a distribution of matter such as a cluster of galaxies between a distant light source and an observer that is capable of bending the light from the source as the light travels towards the observer this effect is known as gravitational lensing and the amount of bending is one of the predictions of albert einsteins general theory of relativity classical physics also predicts the bending of light but only half that predicted by general relativity
orest khvolson 1924 and frantisek link 1936 are generally credited with being the first to discuss the effect in print however this effect is more commonly associated with einstein who published a more famous article on the subject in 1936
fritz zwicky posited in 1937 that the effect could allow galaxy clusters to act as gravitational lenses it was not until 1979 that this effect was confirmed by observation of the so-called twin qso sbs 0957561


 description 

unlike an optical lens a gravitational lens produces a maximum deflection of light that passes closest to its center and a minimum deflection of light that travels furthest from its center consequently a gravitational lens has no single focal point but a focal line the term lens in the context of gravitational light deflection was first used by oj lodge who remarked that it is not permissible to say that the solar gravitational field acts like a lens for it has no focal length if the light source the massive lensing object and the observer lie in a straight line the original light source will appear as a ring around the massive lensing object if there is any misalignment the observer will see an arc segment instead this phenomenon was first mentioned in 1924 by the st petersburg physicist orest chwolson and quantified by albert einstein in 1936 it is usually referred to in the literature as an einstein ring since chwolson did not concern himself with the flux or radius of the ring image more commonly where the lensing mass is complex such as a galaxy group or cluster and does not cause a spherical distortion of space–time the source will resemble partial arcs scattered around the lens the observer may then see multiple distorted images of the same source the number and shape of these depending upon the relative positions of the source lens and observer and the shape of the gravitational well of the lensing object
there are three classes of gravitational lensing
1 strong lensing where there are easily visible distortions such as the formation of einstein rings arcs and multiple images
2 weak lensing where the distortions of background sources are much smaller and can only be detected by analyzing large numbers of sources in a statistical way to find coherent distortions of only a few percent the lensing shows up statistically as a preferred stretching of the background objects perpendicular to the direction to the centre of the lens by measuring the shapes and orientations of large numbers of distant galaxies their orientations can be averaged to measure the shear of the lensing field in any region this in turn can be used to reconstruct the mass distribution in the area in particular the background distribution of dark matter can be reconstructed since galaxies are intrinsically elliptical and the weak gravitational lensing signal is small a very large number of galaxies must be used in these surveys these weak lensing surveys must carefully avoid a number of important sources of systematic error the intrinsic shape of galaxies the tendency of a cameras point spread function to distort the shape of a galaxy and the tendency of atmospheric seeing to distort images must be understood and carefully accounted for the results of these surveys are important for cosmological parameter estimation to better understand and improve upon the lambda-cdm model and to provide a consistency check on other cosmological observations they may also provide an important future constraint on dark energy
3 microlensing where no distortion in shape can be seen but the amount of light received from a background object changes in time the lensing object may be stars in the milky way in one typical case with the background source being stars in a remote galaxy or in another case an even more distant quasar the effect is small such that in the case of strong lensing even a galaxy with a mass more than 100 billion times that of the sun will produce multiple images separated by only a few arcseconds galaxy clusters can produce separations of several arcminutes in both cases the galaxies and sources are quite distant many hundreds of megaparsecs away from our galaxy
gravitational lenses act equally on all kinds of electromagnetic radiation not just visible light weak lensing effects are being studied for the cosmic microwave background as well as galaxy surveys strong lenses have been observed in radio and x-ray regimes as well if a strong lens produces multiple images there will be a relative time delay between two paths that is in one image the lensed object will be observed before the other image


 history 

henry cavendish in 1784 in an unpublished manuscript and johann georg von soldner in 1801 published in 1804 had pointed out that newtonian gravity predicts that starlight will bend around a massive object as had already been supposed by isaac newton in 1704 in his famous queries no.1 in his book opticks the same value as soldners was calculated by einstein in 1911 based on the equivalence principle alone however einstein noted in 1915 in the process of completing general relativity that his and thus soldners 1911-result is only half of the correct value einstein became the first to calculate the correct value for light bending
the first observation of light deflection was performed by noting the change in position of stars as they passed near the sun on the celestial sphere the observations were performed in 1919 by arthur eddington frank watson dyson and their collaborators during the total solar eclipse on may 29 the solar eclipse allowed the stars near the sun to be observed observations were made simultaneously in the cities of sobral ceará brazil and in são tomé and príncipe on the west coast of africa the observations demonstrated that the light from stars passing close to the sun was slightly bent so that stars appeared slightly out of position

the result was considered spectacular news and made the front page of most major newspapers it made einstein and his theory of general relativity world-famous when asked by his assistant what his reaction would have been if general relativity had not been confirmed by eddington and dyson in 1919 einstein famously made the quip then i would feel sorry for the dear lord the theory is correct anyway 
even before his breakthrough in the formulation of general relativity einstein realized that due to light deflection it was also possible that a mass could deflect light along two different paths causing the observer to see multiple images of a single source this effect would make the mass act as a kind of gravitational lens however as he only considered the effect in relation to single stars he seemed to conclude that the phenomenon was unlikely to be observed for the foreseeable future since the necessary alignments between stars and observer would be highly improbable several other physicists speculated about gravitational lensing as well but all reached the same conclusion that it would be nearly impossible to observe
in 1936 after some urging by rudi w mandl einstein reluctantly published the short article lens-like action of a star by the deviation of light in the gravitational field in the journal science
in 1937 fritz zwicky first considered the case where the newly discovered galaxies which were called nebulae at the time could act as both source and lens and that because of the mass and sizes involved the effect was much more likely to be observed
in 1963 yu g klimov s liebes und sjur refsdal recognized independently that quasars are an ideal light source for the gravitational lens effect
it was not until 1979 that the first gravitational lens would be discovered it became known as the twin qso since it initially looked like two identical quasistellar objects it is officially named sbs 0957561 this gravitational lens was discovered by dennis walsh bob carswell and ray weymann using the kitt peak national observatory 2.1 meter telescope
in the 1980s astronomers realized that the combination of ccd imagers and computers would allow the brightness of millions of stars to be measured each night in a dense field such as the galactic center or the magellanic clouds many microlensing events per year could potentially be found this led to efforts such as optical gravitational lensing experiment or ogle that have characterized hundreds of such events including those of ogle-2016-blg-1190lb and ogle-2016-blg-1195lb


 explanation in terms of space–time curvature 

in general relativity light follows the curvature of spacetime hence when light passes around a massive object it is bent this means that the light from an object on the other side will be bent towards an observers eye just like an ordinary lens in general relativity the speed of light depends on the gravitational potential aka the metric and this bending can be viewed as a consequence of the light traveling along a gradient in light speed light rays are the boundary between the future the spacelike and the past regions the gravitational attraction can be viewed as the motion of undisturbed objects in a background curved geometry or alternatively as the response of objects to a force in a flat geometry the angle of deflection is

 search for gravitational lenses 

most of the gravitational lenses in the past have been discovered accidentally a search for gravitational lenses in the northern hemisphere cosmic lens all sky survey class done in radio frequencies using the very large array vla in new mexico led to the discovery of 22 new lensing systems a major milestone this has opened a whole new avenue for research ranging from finding very distant objects to finding values for cosmological parameters so we can understand the universe better
a similar search in the southern hemisphere would be a very good step towards complementing the northern hemisphere search as well as obtaining other objectives for study if such a search is done using well-calibrated and well-parameterized instrument and data a result similar to the northern survey can be expected the use of the australia telescope 20 ghz at20g survey data collected using the australia telescope compact array atca stands to be such a collection of data as the data were collected using the same instrument maintaining a very stringent quality of data we should expect to obtain good results from the search the at20g survey is a blind survey at 20 ghz frequency in the radio domain of the electromagnetic spectrum due to the high frequency used the chances of finding gravitational lenses increases as the relative number of compact core objects eg quasars are higher sadler et al 2006 this is important as the lensing is easier to detect and identify in simple objects compared to objects with complexity in them this search involves the use of interferometric methods to identify candidates and follow them up at higher resolution to identify them full detail of the project is currently under works for publication
microlensing techniques have been used to search for planets outside our solar system a statistical analysis of specific cases of observed microlensing over the time period of 2002 to 2007 found that most stars in the milky way galaxy hosted at least one orbiting planet within .5 to 10 aus
in a 2009 article on science daily a team of scientists led by a cosmologist from the us department of energys lawrence berkeley national laboratory has made major progress in extending the use of gravitational lensing to the study of much older and smaller structures than was previously possible by stating that weak gravitational lensing improves measurements of distant galaxies
astronomers from the max planck institute for astronomy in heidelberg germany the results of which are accepted for publication on oct 21 2013 in the astrophysical journal letters arxivorg discovered what at the time was the most distant gravitational lens galaxy termed as j10000221 using nasa’s hubble space telescope while it remains the most distant quad-image lensing galaxy known an even more distant two-image lensing galaxy was subsequently discovered by an international team of astronomers using a combination of hubble space telescope and keck telescope imaging and spectroscopy the discovery and analysis of the irc 0218 lens was published in the astrophysical journal letters on june 23 2014
research published sep 30 2013 in the online edition of physical review letters led by mcgill university in montreal québec canada has discovered the b-modes that are formed due to gravitational lensing effect using national science foundations south pole telescope and with help from the herschel space observatory this discovery would open the possibilities of testing the theories of how our universe originated


 solar gravitational lens 
albert einstein predicted in 1936 that rays of light from the same direction that skirt the edges of the sun would converge to a focal point approximately 542 aus from the sun thus a probe positioned at this distance or greater from the sun could use the sun as a gravitational lens for magnifying distant objects on the opposite side of the sun a probes location could shift around as needed to select different targets relative to the sun
this distance is far beyond the progress and equipment capabilities of space probes such as voyager 1 and beyond the known planets and dwarf planets though over thousands of years 90377 sedna will move farther away on its highly elliptical orbit the high gain for potentially detecting signals through this lens such as microwaves at the 21-cm hydrogen line led to the suggestion by frank drake in the early days of seti that a probe could be sent to this distance a multipurpose probe setisail and later focal was proposed to the esa in 1993 but is expected to be a difficult task if a probe does pass 542 au magnification capabilities of the lens will continue to act at farther distances as the rays that come to a focus at larger distances pass further away from the distortions of the suns corona a critique of the concept was given by landis who discussed issues including interference of the solar corona the high magnification of the target which will make the design of the mission focal plane difficult and an analysis of the inherent spherical aberration of the lens


 measuring weak lensing 

kaiser squires and broadhurst 1995 luppino  kaiser 1997 and hoekstra et al 1998 prescribed a method to invert the effects of the point spread function psf smearing and shearing recovering a shear estimator uncontaminated by the systematic distortion of the psf this method ksb is the most widely used method in current weak lensing shear measurements
galaxies have random rotations and inclinations as a result the shear effects in weak lensing need to be determined by statistically preferred orientations the primary source of error in lensing measurement is due to the convolution of the psf with the lensed image the ksb method measures the ellipticity of a galaxy image the shear is proportional to the ellipticity the objects in lensed images are parameterized according to their weighted quadrupole moments for a perfect ellipse the weighted quadrupole moments are related to the weighted ellipticity ksb calculate how a weighted ellipticity measure is related to the shear and use the same formalism to remove the effects of the psf
ksb’s primary advantages are its mathematical ease and relatively simple implementation however ksb is based on a key assumption that the psf is circular with an anisotropic distortion this is a reasonable assumption for current cosmic shear surveys but the next generation of surveys eg lsst may need much better accuracy than ksb can provide this is because during that time the statistical errors from the data would be negligible so the systematic errors will dominate
