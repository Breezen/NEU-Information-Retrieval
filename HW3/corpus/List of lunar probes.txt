this is a list of space probes that have flown by impacted or landed on the moon for the purpose of lunar exploration as well as probes launched toward the moon that failed to reach their target confirmed future probes are included but missions that are still at the concept stage or which never progressed beyond the concept stage are not
the list does not include the manned apollo missions

† means tentatively identified as classified by nasa 1 these are cold war-era soviet missions mostly failures about which few or no details have been officially released the information given may be speculative
date is the date of

closest encounter flybys
impact impactors
orbital insertion to end of mission whether planned or premature orbiters
landing to end of mission whether planned or premature landers
launch missions that never got underway due to failure at or soon after launch

in cases which do not fit any of the above the event to which the date refers is stated note that as a result of this scheme missions are not always listed in order of launch
in the case of flybys such as gravity assists that are incidental to the main mission success indicates the successful completion of the flyby not necessarily that of the main mission
