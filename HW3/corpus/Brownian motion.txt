brownian motion or pedesis from ancient greek πήδησισ pέːdεːsis leaping is the random motion of particles suspended in a fluid a liquid or a gas resulting from their collision with the fast-moving molecules in the fluid
this pattern of motion typically alternates random fluctuations in a particles position inside a fluid sub-domain with a relocation to another sub-domain each relocation is followed by more fluctuations within the new closed volume this pattern describes a fluid at thermal equilibrium defined by a given temperature within such fluid there exists no preferential direction of flow as in transport phenomena more specifically the fluids overall linear and angular momenta remain null over time it is important also to note that the kinetic energies of the molecular brownian motions together with those of molecular rotations and vibrations sum up to the caloric component of a fluid’s internal energy
this motion is named after robert brown botanist born 1773 in 1827 while looking through a microscope at particles trapped in cavities inside pollen grains in water he noted that the particles moved through the water but he was not able to determine the mechanisms that caused this motion atoms and molecules had long been theorized as the constituents of matter and albert einstein published a paper in 1905 that explained in precise detail how the motion that brown had observed was a result of the pollen being moved by individual water molecules making one of his first big contributions to science this explanation of brownian motion served as convincing evidence that atoms and molecules exist and was further verified experimentally by jean perrin in 1908 perrin was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 1926 for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter the direction of the force of atomic bombardment is constantly changing and at different times the particle is hit more on one side than another leading to the seemingly random nature of the motion
the many-body interactions that yield the brownian pattern cannot be solved by a model accounting for every involved molecule in consequence only probabilistic models applied to molecular populations can be employed to describe it two such models of the statistical mechanics due to einstein and smoluchowski are presented below another pure probabilistic class of models is the class of the stochastic process models there exist both simpler and more complicated stochastic processes which in extreme taken to the limit may describe the brownian motion see random walk and donskers theorem


 history 
the roman lucretiuss scientific poem on the nature of things c 60 bc has a remarkable description of brownian motion of dust particles in verses 113–140 from book ii he uses this as a proof of the existence of atoms

observe what happens when sunbeams are admitted into a building and shed light on its shadowy places you will see a multitude of tiny particles mingling in a multitude of ways their dancing is an actual indication of underlying movements of matter that are hidden from our sight it originates with the atoms which move of themselves ie spontaneously then those small compound bodies that are least removed from the impetus of the atoms are set in motion by the impact of their invisible blows and in turn cannon against slightly larger bodies so the movement mounts up from the atoms and gradually emerges to the level of our senses so that those bodies are in motion that we see in sunbeams moved by blows that remain invisible
although the mingling motion of dust particles is caused largely by air currents the glittering tumbling motion of small dust particles is indeed caused chiefly by true brownian dynamics
while jan ingenhousz described the irregular motion of coal dust particles on the surface of alcohol in 1785 the discovery of this phenomenon is often credited to the botanist robert brown in 1827 brown was studying pollen grains of the plant clarkia pulchella suspended in water under a microscope when he observed minute particles ejected by the pollen grains executing a jittery motion by repeating the experiment with particles of inorganic matter he was able to rule out that the motion was life-related although its origin was yet to be explained
the first person to describe the mathematics behind brownian motion was thorvald n thiele in a paper on the method of least squares published in 1880 this was followed independently by louis bachelier in 1900 in his phd thesis the theory of speculation in which he presented a stochastic analysis of the stock and option markets the brownian motion model of the stock market is often cited but benoit mandelbrot rejected its applicability to stock price movements in part because these are discontinuous
albert einstein in one of his 1905 papers and marian smoluchowski 1906 brought the solution of the problem to the attention of physicists and presented it as a way to indirectly confirm the existence of atoms and molecules their equations describing brownian motion were subsequently verified by the experimental work of jean baptiste perrin in 1908


 statistical mechanics theories 


 einsteins theory 
there are two parts to einsteins theory the first part consists in the formulation of a diffusion equation for brownian particles in which the diffusion coefficient is related to the mean squared displacement of a brownian particle while the second part consists in relating the diffusion coefficient to measurable physical quantities in this way einstein was able to determine the size of atoms and how many atoms there are in a mole or the molecular weight in grams of a gas in accordance to avogadros law this volume is the same for all ideal gases which is 22.414 liters at standard temperature and pressure the number of atoms contained in this volume is referred to as avogadros constant and the determination of this number is tantamount to the knowledge of the mass of an atom since the latter is obtained by dividing the mass of a mole of the gas by avogadros constant

the first part of einsteins argument was to determine how far a brownian particle travels in a given time interval classical mechanics is unable to determine this distance because of the enormous number of bombardments a brownian particle will undergo roughly of the order of 1014 collisions per second thus einstein was led to consider the collective motion of brownian particles
he regarded the increment of particle positions in unrestricted one dimensional x domain as a random variable

this expresses the mean squared displacement in terms of the time elapsed and the diffusivity from this expression einstein argued that the displacement of a brownian particle is not proportional to the elapsed time but rather to its square root his argument is based on a conceptual switch from the ensemble of brownian particles to the single brownian particle we can speak of the relative number of particles at a single instant just as well as of the time it takes a brownian particle to reach a given point
the second part of einsteins theory relates the diffusion constant to physically measurable quantities such as the mean squared displacement of a particle in a given time interval this result enables the experimental determination of avogadros number and therefore the size of molecules einstein analyzed a dynamic equilibrium being established between opposing forces the beauty of his argument is that the final result does not depend upon which forces are involved in setting up the dynamic equilibrium
in his original treatment einstein considered an osmotic pressure experiment but the same conclusion can be reached in other ways
consider for instance particles suspended in a viscous fluid in a gravitational field gravity tends to make the particles settle whereas diffusion acts to homogenize them driving them into regions of smaller concentration under the action of gravity a particle acquires a downward speed of v  μmg where m is the mass of the particle g is the acceleration due to gravity and μ is the particles mobility in the fluid george stokes had shown that the mobility for a spherical particle with radius r is

here the first equality follows from the first part of einsteins theory the third equality follows from the definition of boltzmanns constant as kb  r  n and the fourth equality follows from stokess formula for the mobility by measuring the mean squared displacement over a time interval along with the universal gas constant r the temperature t the viscosity η and the particle radius r avogadros number n can be determined
the type of dynamical equilibrium proposed by einstein was not new it had been pointed out previously by j j thomson in his series of lectures at yale university in may 1903 that the dynamic equilibrium between the velocity generated by a concentration gradient given by ficks law and the velocity due to the variation of the partial pressure caused when ions are set in motion gives us a method of determining avogadros constant which is independent of any hypothesis as to the shape or size of molecules or of the way in which they act upon each other
an identical expression to einsteins formula for the diffusion coefficient was also found by walther nernst in 1888 in which he expressed the diffusion coefficient as the ratio of the osmotic pressure to the ratio of the frictional force and the velocity to which it gives rise the former was equated to the law of van t hoff while the latter was given by stokess law he writes

   is the osmotic pressure and k is the ratio of the frictional force to the molecular viscosity which he assumes is given by stokess formula for the viscosity introducing the ideal gas law per unit volume for the osmotic pressure the formula becomes identical to that of einsteins the use of stokess law in nernsts case as well as in einstein and smoluchowski is not strictly applicable since it does not apply to the case where the radius of the sphere is small in comparison with the mean free path
at first the predictions of einsteins formula were seemingly refuted by a series of experiments by svedberg in 1906 and 1907 which gave displacements of the particles as 4 to 6 times the predicted value and by henri in 1908 who found displacements 3 times greater than einsteins formula predicted but einsteins predictions were finally confirmed in a series of experiments carried out by chaudesaigues in 1908 and perrin in 1909 the confirmation of einsteins theory constituted empirical progress for the kinetic theory of heat in essence einstein showed that the motion can be predicted directly from the kinetic model of thermal equilibrium the importance of the theory lay in the fact that it confirmed the kinetic theorys account of the second law of thermodynamics as being an essentially statistical law


 smoluchowski model 
smoluchowskis theory of brownian motion starts from the same premise as that of einstein and derives the same probability distribution ρx t for the displacement of a brownian particle along the x in time t he therefore gets the same expression for the mean squared displacement

smoluchowski attempts to answer the question of why a brownian particle should be displaced by bombardments of smaller particles when the probabilities for striking it in the forward and rear directions are equal in order to do so he uses unknowingly the ballot theorem first proved by wa whitworth in 1878 the ballot theorem states that if a candidate a scores m votes and candidate b scores n − m that the probability throughout the counting that a will have more votes than b is

suppose that a brownian particle of mass m is surrounded by lighter particles of mass m which are traveling at a speed u then reasons smoluchowski in any collision between a surrounding and brownian particles the velocity transmitted to the latter will be mum this ratio is of the order of 10−7 cms but we also have to take into consideration that in a gas there will be more than 1016 collisions in a second and even greater in a liquid where we expect that there will be 1020 collision in one second some of these collisions will tend to accelerate the brownian particle others will tend to decelerate it if there is a mean excess of one kind of collision or the other to be of the order of 108 to 1010 collisions in one second then velocity of the brownian particle may be anywhere between 10 and 1000 cms thus even though there are equal probabilities for forward and backward collisions there will be a net tendency to keep the brownian particle in motion just as the ballot theorem predicts
these orders of magnitude are not exact because they dont take into consideration the velocity of the brownian particle u which depends on the collisions that tend to accelerate and decelerate it the larger u is the greater will be the collisions that will retard it so that the velocity of a brownian particle can never increase without limit could such a process occur it would be tantamount to a perpetual motion of the second type and since equipartition of energy applies the kinetic energy of the brownian particle

in 1906 smoluchowski published a one-dimensional model to describe a particle undergoing brownian motion the model assumes collisions with m ≫ m where m is the test particles mass and m the mass of one of the individual particles composing the fluid it is assumed that the particle collisions are confined to one dimension and that it is equally probable for the test particle to be hit from the left as from the right it is also assumed that every collision always imparts the same magnitude of δv if nr is the number of collisions from the right and nl the number of collisions from the left then after n collisions the particles velocity will have changed by δv2nr − n the multiplicity is then simply given by

as a result of its simplicity smoluchowskis 1d model can only qualitatively describe brownian motion for a realistic particle undergoing brownian motion in a fluid many of the assumptions cannot be made for example the assumption that on average there occurs an equal number of collisions from the right as from the left falls apart once the particle is in motion also there would be a distribution of different possible δvs instead of always just one in a realistic situation


 other physics models using partial differential equations 
the diffusion equation yields an approximation of the time evolution of the probability density function associated to the position of the particle going under a brownian movement under the physical definition the approximation is valid on short timescales
the time evolution of the position of the brownian particle itself is best described using langevin equation an equation which involves a random force field representing the effect of the thermal fluctuations of the solvent on the particle
the displacement of a particle undergoing brownian motion is obtained by solving the diffusion equation under appropriate boundary conditions and finding the rms of the solution this shows that the displacement varies as the square root of the time not linearly which explains why previous experimental results concerning the velocity of brownian particles gave nonsensical results a linear time dependence was incorrectly assumed
at very short time scales however the motion of a particle is dominated by its inertia and its displacement will be linearly dependent on time δx  vδt so the instantaneous velocity of the brownian motion can be measured as v  δxδt when δt  τ where τ is the momentum relaxation time in 2010 the instantaneous velocity of a brownian particle a glass microsphere trapped in air with an optical tweezer was measured successfully the velocity data verified the maxwell–boltzmann velocity distribution and the equipartition theorem for a brownian particle

a third characterisation is that the wiener process has a spectral representation as a sine series whose coefficients are independent

   random variables this representation can be obtained using the karhunen–loève theorem
the wiener process can be constructed as the scaling limit of a random walk or other discrete-time stochastic processes with stationary independent increments this is known as donskers theorem like the random walk the wiener process is recurrent in one or two dimensions meaning that it returns almost surely to any fixed neighborhood of the origin infinitely often whereas it is not recurrent in dimensions three and higher unlike the random walk it is scale invariant
the time evolution of the position of the brownian particle itself can be described approximately by a langevin equation an equation which involves a random force field representing the effect of the thermal fluctuations of the solvent on the brownian particle on long timescales the mathematical brownian motion is well described by a langevin equation on small timescales inertial effects are prevalent in the langevin equation however the mathematical brownian motion is exempt of such inertial effects note that inertial effects have to be considered in the langevin equation otherwise the equation becomes singular so that simply removing the inertia term from this equation would not yield an exact description but rather a singular behavior in which the particle doesnt move at all


 statistics 
the brownian motion can be modeled by a random walk random walks in porous media or fractals are anomalous
in the general case brownian motion is a non-markov random process and described by stochastic integral equations


 lévy characterisation 
the french mathematician paul lévy proved the following theorem which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a continuous rn-valued stochastic process x to actually be n-dimensional brownian motion hence lévys condition can actually be used as an alternative definition of brownian motion
let x  x1  xn be a continuous stochastic process on a probability space ω σ p taking values in rn then the following are equivalent
x is a brownian motion with respect to p ie the law of x with respect to p is the same as the law of an n-dimensional brownian motion ie the push-forward measure x∗p is classical wiener measure on c00 ∞ rn
both
x is a martingale with respect to p and its own natural filtration and
for all 1 ≤ i j ≤ n xitxjt −δijt is a martingale with respect to p and its own natural filtration where δij denotes the kronecker delta


 riemannian manifold 

the infinitesimal generator and hence characteristic operator of a brownian motion on rn is easily calculated to be ½δ where δ denotes the laplace operator in image processing and computer vision the laplacian operator has been used for various tasks such as blob and edge detection this observation is useful in defining brownian motion on an m-dimensional riemannian manifold m g a brownian motion on m is defined to be a diffusion on m whose characteristic operator

 narrow escape 
the narrow escape problem is a ubiquitous problem in biology biophysics and cellular biology which has the following formulation a brownian particle ion molecule or protein is confined to a bounded domain a compartment or a cell by a reflecting boundary except for a small window through which it can escape the narrow escape problem is that of calculating the mean escape time this time diverges as the window shrinks thus rendering the calculation a singular perturbation problem
