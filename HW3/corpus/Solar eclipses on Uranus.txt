solar eclipses on uranus occur when any of the natural satellites of uranus passes in front of the sun as seen from uranus eclipses can occur only near a solar ring plane-crossing of uranus equinox occurring approximately every 42 years with the last crossing being in 2007/2008
for bodies that appear smaller in angular diameter than the sun the proper term would be a transit for bodies that are larger than the apparent size of the sun the proper term would be an occultation
twelve satellites of uranus—cressida desdemona juliet portia rosalind belinda puck miranda ariel umbriel titania and oberon—are large enough and near enough to eclipse the sun
all other satellites of uranus are too small or too distant to produce an umbra
at its distance from the sun the suns angular diameter is reduced to a tiny disk about 2 arcminutes across the angular diameters of the moons large enough to fully eclipse the sun are cressida 6–8 desdemona 6–7 juliet 10–12 portia 9–13 rosalind 4–5 belinda 6–8 puck 6–8 miranda 10–15 ariel 20–23 umbriel 15–17 titania 11–13 oberon 8–9
