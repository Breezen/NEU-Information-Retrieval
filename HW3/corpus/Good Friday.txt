 in eastern and oriental orthodox christianity 

byzantine christians eastern christians who follow the rite of constantinople orthodox christians and greek-catholics call this day great and holy friday or simply great friday
because the sacrifice of jesus through his crucifixion is commemorated on this day the divine liturgy the sacrifice of bread and wine is never celebrated on great friday except when this day coincides with the great feast of the annunciation which falls on the fixed date of 25 march for those churches which follow the traditional julian calendar 25 march currently falls on 7 april of the modern gregorian calendar also on great friday the clergy no longer wear the purple or red that is customary throughout great lent but instead don black vestments there is no stripping of the altar on holy and great thursday as in the west instead all of the church hangings are changed to black and will remain so until the divine liturgy on great saturday
the faithful revisit the events of the day through public reading of specific psalms and the gospels and singing hymns about christs death rich visual imagery and symbolism as well as stirring hymnody are remarkable elements of these observances in the orthodox understanding the events of holy week are not simply an annual commemoration of past events but the faithful actually participate in the death and resurrection of jesus

each hour of this day is the new suffering and the new effort of the expiatory suffering of the savior and the echo of this suffering is already heard in every word of our worship service – unique and incomparable both in the power of tenderness and feeling and in the depth of the boundless compassion for the suffering of the savior the holy church opens before the eyes of believers a full picture of the redeeming suffering of the lord beginning with the bloody sweat in the garden of gethsemane up to the crucifixion on golgotha taking us back through the past centuries in thought the holy church brings us to the foot of the cross of christ erected on golgotha and makes us present among the quivering spectators of all the torture of the savior

great and holy friday is observed as a strict fast and adult byzantine christians are expected to abstain from all food and drink the entire day to the extent that their health permits on this holy day neither a meal is offered nor do we eat on this day of the crucifixion if someone is unable or has become very old or is unable to fast he may be given bread and water after sunset in this way we come to the holy commandment of the holy apostles not to eat on great friday

during the service all come forward to kiss the feet of christ on the cross after the canon a brief moving hymn the wise thief is chanted by singers who stand at the foot of the cross in the center of the nave the service does not end with the first hour as usual but with a special dismissal by the priest

may christ our true god who for the salvation of the world endured spitting and scourging and buffeting and the cross and death through the intercessions of his most pure mother of our holy and god-bearing fathers and of all the saints have mercy on us and save us for he is good and the lover of mankind


 royal hours

 vespers of holy and great friday 

in the afternoon around 3 pm all gather for the vespers of the taking-down from the cross commemorating the deposition from the cross the gospel reading is a concatenation taken from all four of the gospels during the service the body of christ the soma is removed from the cross as the words in the gospel reading mention joseph of arimathea wrapped in a linen shroud and taken to the altar in the sanctuary

near the end of the service an epitaphios or winding sheet a cloth embroidered with the image of christ prepared for burial is carried in procession to a low table in the nave which represents the tomb of christ it is often decorated with an abundance of flowers the epitaphios itself represents the body of jesus wrapped in a burial shroud and is a roughly full-size cloth icon of the body of christ then the priest may deliver a homily and everyone comes forward to venerate the epitaphios in the slavic practice at the end of vespers compline is immediately served featuring a special canon of the crucifixion of our lord and the lamentation of the most holy theotokos by symeon the logothete


 matins of holy and great saturday 

on friday night the matins of holy and great saturday a unique service known as the lamentation at the tomb epitáphios thrēnos is celebrated this service is also sometimes called jerusalem matins much of the service takes place around the tomb of christ in the center of the nave
a unique feature of the service is the chanting of the lamentations or praises enkōmia which consist of verses chanted by the clergy interspersed between the verses of psalm 119 which is by far the longest psalm in the bible the enkōmia are the best-loved hymns of byzantine hymnography both their poetry and their music being uniquely suited to each other and to the spirit of the day they consist of 185 tercet antiphons arranged in three parts stáseis or stops which are interjected with the verses of psalm 119 and nine short doxastiká gloriae and theotókia invocations to the virgin mary the three stáseis are each set to its own music and are commonly known by their initial antiphons ἡ ζωὴ ἐν τάφωι life in a grave ἄξιον ἐστί worthy it is and αἱ γενεαὶ πᾶσαι all the generations musically they can be classified as strophic with 75 62 and 48 tercet stanzas each respectively the climax of the enkōmia comes during the third stásis with the antiphon ō glyký mou éar a lamentation of the virgin for her dead child o my sweet spring my sweetest child where has your beauty gone the authors and date of the enkōmia are unknown their high attic linguistic style suggests a dating around the 6th century possibly before the time of st romanos the melodist

at the end of the great doxology while the trisagion is sung the epitaphios is taken in procession around the outside the church and is then returned to the tomb some churches observe the practice of holding the epitaphios at the door above waist level so the faithful most bow down under it as they come back into the church symbolizing their entering into the death and resurrection of christ the epitaphios will lay in the tomb until the paschal service early sunday morning in some churches the epitaphios is never left alone but is accompanied 24 hours a day by a reader chanting from the psalter

 in the roman catholic church 


 day of fasting 

the catholic church regards good friday and holy saturday as the paschal fast in accord with article 110 of sacrosanctum concilium in the latin church a fast day is understood as having only one full meal and two collations a smaller repast the two of which together do not equal the one full meal – although this may be observed less stringently on holy saturday than on good friday – and on which the faithful abstain from eating meat this is why many places have the typical fish friday in countries where good friday is not a day of rest from work the afternoon liturgical service is usually put off until a few hours after the recommended time of 3 pm


 services on the day 
the roman rite has no celebration of mass between the lords supper on holy thursday evening and the easter vigil unless a special exemption is granted for rare solemn or grave occasions by the vatican or the local bishop the only sacraments celebrated during this time are baptism for those in danger of death penance and anointing of the sick while there is no celebration of the eucharist it is distributed to the faithful only in the service of the passion of the lord but can also be taken at any hour to the sick who are unable to attend this service during this period crosses candlesticks and altar cloths are removed from the altar which remains completely bare though these things are gradually added to the altar as part of the ceremony it is also customary to empty the holy water fonts in preparation of the blessing of the water at the easter vigil traditionally no bells are rung on good friday or holy saturday until the easter vigil
the celebration of the passion of the lord takes place in the afternoon ideally at three oclock but for pastoral reasons a later hour may be chosen the vestments used are red more commonly or black more traditionally before 1970 vestments were black except for the communion part of the rite when violet was used before 1955 black was used throughout if a bishop or abbot celebrates he wears a plain mitre mitra simplex


 liturgy 

the good friday liturgy consists of three parts the liturgy of the word the veneration of the cross and holy communion
the liturgy of the word consists of the clergy and assisting ministers entering in complete silence without any singing they then silently make a full prostration signifying the abasement of earthly man it also symbolizes the grief and sorrow of the church then follows the collect prayer and the reading or chanting of isaiah 5213–5312 hebrews 414–16 57–9 and the passion account from the gospel of john traditionally divided between three deacons yet usually divided between the celebrant one or two singers or readers and the congregation which speaks the part of the crowd this part of the liturgy concludes with the orationes sollemnes a series of prayers for the church the pope the clergy and laity of the church those preparing for baptism the unity of christians the jewish people those who do not believe in christ those who do not believe in god those in public office those in special need after each prayer intention the deacon calls the faithful to kneel for a short period of private prayer the celebrant then sums up the prayer intention with a collect-style prayer
the adoration of the cross has a crucifix not necessarily the one that is normally on or near the altar at other times of the year solemnly unveiled and displayed to the congregation and then venerated by them individually if possible and usually by kissing the wood of the cross while hymns and the improperia reproaches with the trisagion hymn are chanted
holy communion is done according to a rite based on that of the final part of mass beginning with the our father but omitting the ceremony of breaking of the bread and its related chant the agnus dei the eucharist consecrated at the evening mass of the lords supper on holy thursday is distributed at this service before the reform of pope pius xii only the priest received communion in the framework of what was called the mass of the presanctified which included the usual offertory prayers with the placing of wine in the chalice but which omitted the canon of the mass the priest and people then depart in silence and the altar cloth is removed leaving the altar bare except for the crucifix and two or four candlesticks


 stations of the cross 

in addition to the prescribed liturgical service the stations of the cross are often prayed either in the church or outside and a prayer service may be held from midday to 3.00 pm known as the three hours agony in countries such as malta italy philippines puerto rico and spain processions with statues representing the passion of christ are held
in rome since the papacy of saint john paul ii the heights of the temple of venus and roma and their position opposite the main entrance to the colosseum have been used to good effect as a public address platform this may be seen in the photograph below where a red canopy has been erected to shelter the pope as well as an illuminated cross on the occasion of the way of the cross ceremony the pope either personally or through a representative leads the faithful through meditations on the stations of the cross while a cross is carried from there to the colosseum
in polish churches a tableau of christs tomb is unveiled in the sanctuary many of the faithful spend long hours into the night grieving at the tomb where it is customary to kiss the wounds on the lords body a life-size figure of jesus lying in his tomb is widely visited by the faithful especially on holy saturday the tableaux may include flowers candles figures of angels standing watch and the three crosses atop mt calvary and much more each parish strives to come up with the most artistically and religiously evocative arrangement in which the blessed sacrament draped in a filmy veil is prominently displayed


 acts of reparation to jesus christ 

the roman catholic tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as acts of reparation for the sufferings and insults that jesus suffered during his passion on good friday these acts of reparation to jesus christ do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary but aim to repair the sins against jesus some such prayers are provided in the raccolta catholic prayer book approved by a decree of 1854 and published by the holy see in 1898 which also includes prayers as acts of reparation to the virgin mary
in his encyclical miserentissimus redemptor on reparations pope pius xi called acts of reparation to jesus christ a duty for catholics and referred to them as some sort of compensation to be rendered for the injury with respect to the sufferings of jesus
pope john paul ii referred to acts of reparation as the unceasing effort to stand beside the endless crosses on which the son of god continues to be crucified


 anglican communion 
the 1662 book of common prayer did not specify a particular rite to be observed on good friday but local custom came to mandate an assortment of services including the seven last words from the cross and a three-hour service consisting of matins ante-communion using the reserved sacrament in high church parishes and evensong in recent times revised editions of the prayer book and common worship have re-introduced pre-reformation forms of observance of good friday corresponding to those in todays roman catholic church with special nods to the rites that had been observed in the church of england prior to the henrican edwardian and elizabethan reforms including creeping to the cross


 lutheran church 
in lutheran tradition from the 16th to the 20th century good friday was the most important religious holiday and abstention from all worldly works was expected during that time lutheranism had no restrictions on the celebration of the eucharist on good friday on the contrary it was a prime day on which to receive the eucharist and services were often accentuated by special music such as the st matthew passion by johann sebastian bach
more recently lutheran liturgical practice has recaptured good friday as part of the larger sweep of the great three days maundy thursday good friday and the vigil of easter the three days remain one liturgy which celebrates the death and resurrection of jesus as part of the liturgy of the three days lutherans generally fast from the eucharist on good friday rather it is celebrated in remembrance of the last supper on maundy thursday and at the vigil of easter one practice among lutheran churches is to celebrate a tenebrae service on good friday typically conducted in candlelight and consisting of a collection of passion accounts from the four gospels while being called tenebrae it holds little resemblance to the now-suppressed catholic monastic rite of the same name the good friday liturgy appointed in evangelical lutheran worship the worship book of the evangelical lutheran church in america specifies a liturgy similar to the revised roman catholic liturgy a rite for adoration of the crucified christ includes the optional singing of the solemn reproaches in an updated and revised translation which eliminates some of the anti-jewish overtones in previous versions influenced by the ecumenical liturgical renewal movement and in an attempt to recover patterns of worship from the early church many lutheran congregations are moving away from long preaching services centered on a dramatic and sentimentalized remembrance of the seven last words sayings of jesus assembled from the four gospels toward a more devotional practice that places an emphasis on the triumph of the cross and a singular biblical account of the passion narrative from the gospel of john
along with observing a general lenten fast many lutherans emphasize the importance of good friday as a day of fasting within the kalendar a handbook for the discipline of lent recommends the lutheran guideline to fast on ash wednesday and good friday with only one simple meal during the day usually without meat


 other mainstream protestant traditions 
many other mainstream protestant communities hold special services on this day as well moravians hold a lovefeast on good friday as they receive holy communion on maundy thursday the methodist church commemorates good friday with fasting as well as a service of worship often based on the seven last words from the cross it is not uncommon for some communities to hold interdenominational services on good friday
in the reformed tradition good friday is one of the evangelical feasts and is thus widely observed with church services which feature the solemn reproaches in the pattern of psalm 78 towards the end of the liturgy

 calculating the date 

good friday is the friday before easter which is calculated differently in eastern christianity and western christianity see computus for details easter falls on the first sunday following the paschal full moon the full moon on or after 21 march taken to be the date of the vernal equinox the western calculation uses the gregorian calendar while the eastern calculation uses the julian calendar whose 21 march now corresponds to the gregorian calendars 3 april the calculations for identifying the date of the full moon also differ see computus
in eastern christianity easter can fall between 22 march and 25 april on julian calendar thus between 4 april and 8 may in terms of the gregorian calendar during the period 1900 and 2099 so good friday can fall between 20 march and 23 april inclusive or between 2 april and 6 may in terms of the gregorian calendar

 criticism from non-observers 
some baptist congregations the philadelphia church of god and some non-denominational churches oppose the observance of good friday regarding it as a papist tradition and instead observe the crucifixion on wednesday to coincide with the jewish sacrifice of the passover lamb which christians believe is an old testament pointer to jesus christ a wednesday crucifixion of jesus allows for him to be in the tomb heart of the earth for three days and three nights as he told the pharisees he would be matthew 1240 rather than two nights and a day by inclusive counting as was the norm at that time if he had died on a friday preparation day 14 nisan on the hebrew calendar – which is the day before passover 15 nisan instead of the friday morning as the synoptic gospels refer to the sabbath and they believe this refers to a high sabbath which occurs on feast days and not the ordinary weekly sabbath
