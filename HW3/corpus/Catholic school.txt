 background 
irish immigration provides the main contribution to the increases in catholic communities across the globe the irish immigration established the revival of catholicism through movement to countries across europe united kingdom and australia historically the establishment of catholic schools in europe encountered various struggles following the creation of the church of england in the elizabethan religious settlements of 1558-63 anti-catholicism in this period encouraged catholics to create modern catholic education systems to preserve their traditions the relief acts of 1782 and the catholic emancipation act of 1829 later increased the possibility to openly practice catholicism in england and to create charitable institutions by the church this led to the development of numerous native religious congregations which established schools hospitals orphanages reformatories and workhouses
traditionally catholic schools originated as single sex schools catholic schools were previously required to depend on school fees and endowments endowments dropped off sharply causing fees to rise this prevented some students from enrolling due to their inability to pay


 purpose 
catholic schools are distinct from their public school counterparts in focusing on the development of individuals as practitioners of the catholic faith the leaders teachers and students are required to focus on four fundamental rules initiated by the church and school this includes the catholic identity of the school education in regards to life and faith celebration of life and faith and action and social justice
like other christian-affiliated institutions catholic schools are generally nondenominational in that they accept anyone regardless of religion or denominational affiliation race or ethnicity or nationality provided the admission or enrollment requirements and legal documents are submitted and rules  regulations are obeyed for a fruitful school life however non-catholics whether christian or not may need to participate in or be exempted from required activities particularly those of a religious nature these are in keeping with the spirit of social inclusiveness


 religious education 
the religious education as a core subject is a vital element of the curriculum where individuals are to develop themselves “intellectually physically socially emotionally and of course spiritually” the education also involves “the distinct but complementary aspect of the schools religious dimension of liturgical and prayer life of the school community” in catholic schools teachers teach a religious education program provided by the bishop both teacher and bishop therefore contribute to the planning and teaching religious education lessons
catholic education has been identified as a positive fertility factor catholic education at college level and to lesser degree at secondary school level is associated with a higher number of children even when accounting for the confounding effect that higher religiosity leads to a higher probability of attending religious education

 north america 


 canada 

the existence of catholic schools in canada can be traced to the year 1620 when the first school was founded by the catholic recollet order in quebec most schools in canada were operated under the auspices of one christian body or another until the 19th century currently publicly-supported catholic schools operate in three provinces alberta ontario and saskatchewan as well as all three federal territories northwest territories nunavut and yukon to grade 9 only publicly-funded catholic schools operate as separate schools in canada meaning they are constitutionally protected the constitutional protection enjoyed by separate schools in canadian provinces is enshrined in section 93 of the constitution it gives the provinces power over education but with significant restrictions designed to protect minority religious rights these restrictions was a result of significant debate between protestants and catholics in canada over whether schools should be parochial or non-denominational as opposed to the provinces the right to separate schools is protected in the three federal territories by the federal acts of parliament which establish those territories

section 93 was the result of constitutional negotiations in the 1860s pre-existing rights for tax-funded minority catholic and protestant schools had become a major point for negotiations surrounding canadian confederation retention of separate school boards with public funding was a major issue chiefly as a result of ethnic and religious tension between the largely french-speaking roman catholic population in canada and the largely english-speaking protestant majority the issue was a subject of debate at the 1864 quebec conference and was finally resolved at the london conference of 1866 with a proposal to preserve the separate school systems in quebec and ontario the way in which this agreement was written into the constitution was to the effect that the condition of education in each colony or territory at the time it entered confederation would be constitutionally protected thereafter
despite the compromise the debate over separate catholic schools continued to be an issue in the new country manitobas adoption of a single secular school system in 1890 resulted in a national political crisis the manitoba schools question was a political crisis in the 1880s and 1890s revolving around publicly funded separate schools for roman catholics and protestants in manitoba the crisis eventually spread to the national level becoming one of the key issues in the federal election of 1896 due to the close link between religion and language during this period in canada the schools question represented a deeper issue of french survival as a language and a culture in western canada the secular system was upheld with the guarantee of french instruction later being revoked in 1916 leaving english as the only official language in use in the province until it was reinstated in 1985
in the province of quebec publicly funded catholic and protestant schools were maintained until 1997 when the system was replaced by linguistic-based secular school system after passing a constitutional amendment that exempted quebec from certain conditions of section 93 newfoundland and labrador also operated separate schools for several christian denominations including catholics prior to 1997 this school system emerged prior to newfoundlands entry into confederation in 1949 and continued until 1997 when the province established a secular public system the absence of catholic-protestant tensions in the provinces of british columbia new brunswick nova scotia and prince edward island resulted in no separate school systems emerging in these provinces

presently the ontario ministry of education funds 29 english-language catholic school boards and 8 french-language catholic school boards in addition to 31 english-language secular school boards 4 french-language secular school boards and 1 english-language protestant school board originally most of the provinces secular school boards were protestant-based although it was gradually transformed into a secular public system public funding of catholic schools was initially provided only to grade 10 in ontario however in 1985 it was extended to cover the final three years of secondary education grade 11 to grade 13oac publicly funded catholic separate schools are also present in the provinces of alberta and saskatchewan although they are not as prevalent as in the province of ontario
the near-exclusive public funding for a single religious denomination in the province of ontario has garnered controversy in the last few decades the controversy led to a supreme court decision in 1996 that held that the provincial education power under section 93 of the constitution act 1867 is plenary and is not subject to charter attack they also noted it was the product of a historical compromise crucial to confederation and forms a comprehensive code with respect to denominational school rights which cannot be enlarged through the operation of the charter of rights and freedoms the issue has garnered criticism internationally on november 5 1999 the united nations human rights committee condemned canada and ontario for having violated the equality provisions article 26 of the international covenant on civil and political rights the committee restated its concerns on november 2 2005 when it published its concluding observations regarding canadas fifth periodic report under the covenant the committee observed that canada had failed to adopt steps in order to eliminate discrimination on the basis of religion in the funding of schools in ontario


 united states 

catholic schools are the largest non-public school system in the usa in 2010 2 million students attended 6,980 schools 331 of these are private catholicism of schools in the united states was first established during the 19th century with the arrival of english immigrants catholic schools in the usa are significant in that catholicism is seen to have been critical in developing the american culture the development and enrollment of americans into catholic schools increased after world war ii post-war development and cold war in the battle against anti-religious communism by the time of 1964-1965 catholic schools accounted for nearly 89% of all private school attendance and 12% of all school-age children in school k-12 in the usa the number of religious priests brothers and sisters was at its highest allowing schools to offer qualified teachers at minimal costs meaning that most children in the 1940s and 1950s attended their parish school free of charge  since then there has been a large decline in enrollment predominantly believed to be due to “suburbanization liberalization of education and the rise of the catholic middle-class” in the united states catholic schools are accredited by independent andor state agencies and teachers are generally certified schools are supported through tuition payments donations and fund raising charities
in contrast to its public school counterpart catholic urbanization has made more significant achievements in poor areas than wealthier areas holy angels for example has become one of the strongest academic institutions in the country it serves the kenwood oakland neighborhoods of south side chicago illinois where 3 out of 4 people live in poverty and violent crime is frequent

 oceania 


 australia 

in australia catholic schools have been operating for over 175 yearsthe arrival of the first european fleet brought the first irish catholics to australia predominantly by the transport of convicts catholics consisted one-tenth of the convicts settling in australia mostly irish whilst the rest were english and scottish by 1803 2086 convicts of irish descent and majority being catholics had been transported to botany bay

as with other classes of non-government schools in australia catholic schools receive funding from the commonwealth government as this does not constitute the establishment of a church nor the restriction of the free exercise of religion nor does it create a religious test for public office it is not considered to breach the separation of church and state in australia this was the decision of the high court in the defence of government schools dogs case of 1981 in which the judges selectively interpreted s.116 of the australian constitution and is controversial


 new zealand 

catholic education in new zealand was first introduced following the arrival of the first catholic bishop jean baptiste pompallier in 1838 a year after signing the treaty of waitangi the first catholic school in new zealand was developed in auckland on 1841
the schools were originally managed by seven sisters from ireland and aimed to assist the maori population and the new settlers from 1853 to 1875 the provincial governments financed grants for the catholic schools the education act 1877 however allowed all schools to be free compulsory and secular and therefore disallowing funding of catholic schools in the early 1970s increasing rolls and funding constraints saw catholic schools accumulating large amounts of debt or being run down the government fearing the state system was unable to cope with an influx of students if the catholic schools folded enacted the private schools conditional integration act 1975 the act allowed catholic schools and other private schools to integrate with the state system receiving public funding and keeping their catholic character in exchange for being subject to the conditions of being a state school such as having to teach the nationally set curriculum the first catholic schools integrated in august 1979 and by 1984 all catholic schools in new zealand had integrated
as of july 2013 65,700 students attended catholic schools in new zealand making up 8.6 percent of the total student population the majority are new zealand europeans
the catholic schools are owned by a proprietor typically by the bishop of the diocese currently catholic schools in new zealand are termed state-integrated schools for funding purposes meaning that teachers salaries learning materials and operations of the school eg power and gas are publicly funded but the school property is not new zealand catholic schools are built on land owned by the diocese if the government were to fund catholic school property maintenance and capital works above the entitlement of any other private property owner it would be transferring wealth to the bishop breaking the separation of church and state instead parents of students at catholic schools pay attendance dues to the proprietors to fund property costs these are typically nz390 to 430 per year for primary school students ages 5–12 and nz730 to 860 per year for secondary school students ages 13–18


 south america

 funding 


 state funding 

in some countries catholic schools are funded by the state these are institutions that requires assistance from the government this is the same in public schools where government who mandate schools pay for the needs of schools whether in whole or in part by taxes of the population australian catholic schools fall under this category where the australian government fund catholic schools as well as state schools non-independent catholic schools in scotland is another example where the institutions are fully funded by the scottish government


 private schools 

private schools also known as independent schools are not managed by local state or national governments they instead may select their students and are funded in whole or in part by the tuition fees charged to students rather than relying on the government as public schools do students may also get scholarships to enter into a private school depending on the student’s talent


 voluntary aided schools 

voluntary aided schools are a kind of maintained school meaning that they receive the majority of their running costs from central government via the local authority and do not charge fees to students in contrast to other types of maintained school only 90% of the capital costs of a voluntary aided school are met by government the foundation contributes the rest of the capital costs owns the schools land and buildings and appoints a majority of the school governors the governing body runs the school employs the staff and decides the schools admission arrangements subject to rules imposed by central government pupils follow the national curriculum except that faith schools may teach religious education according to their own faith within the maintained sector in england approximately 22% of primary schools and 17% of secondary schools are voluntary aided including all of the roman catholic schools and the schools of non-christian faiths


 international benefits 


 preference for the poor 
catholic schools have experienced changes heralded by the second vatican council in regards to catholic social teaching cantered on the poor “first and foremost the church offers its educational services to the poor or those who are deprived of family help and affection or those who are far from faith” these changes have led to instances in brazil peru and chile where the contributions has led to “a new way of being in school” by including the disadvantaged and people in poor areas to education


 high attendance and performance 
empirical evidence in the united states and australia indicates that education performance and attendance are greater in catholic schools in contrasts to its public counterparts evans and schwab 1998 in their experiment found that attendance at catholic schools in the united states increases the probability of completing high school or commencing college by 13 similarly an experiment conducted by williams and carpenter 1990 of australia through comparing previous examination by private and public schools concluded that students in private education outperform those from government schools on all educational social and economic indicators


 development of girls in society 
catholic schooling has indicated a large impact in the changing role of women for countries such as malta and japan catholic schooling of girls in malta for example indicates “evidence of remarkable commitment to the full development of girls in a global society” similarly all girl schools in japan have also contributed powerfully to the “personal and educational patriarchal society”


 international challenges 


 economic inequality 
the expensive cost and necessity to obtain high salary levels is contributing to the difficulty of maintain catholic schools many catholic schools in the united states in inner america which has traditionally served the most in are continuously being forced to close at an increasing rate this may be seen as contradicting the catholic schools principles as it does not live up to its reality the preferential services to the poor serves a problem when there is a clear distinction that wealthier catholic schools receive better resources and are more privileged than those in areas of low-income this today is being experienced in latin america and other national settings where financial constraints in serving the poor is not being undertaken as state aid or subsidy are not being available to the catholic schools


 political context 
there have been instances where some political ideologies that are engaged with secularism or countries that have high nationalism are suspicious of what catholic schools are teaching the moral and social teachings by catholic schools may be seen as “continuation of colonial cultural dominance of the society” still being felt in zambia malawi and the colonies of spain
