he is known for his four books on special relativity 1911 1914 1921 1936 where he gave a spacetime derivation of the theory in an axiomatic-geometric way robb therefore was sometimes called the euclid of relativity in the first of these works he used a hyperbolic angle ω to introduce the concept of rapidity and showed that the kinematic space of velocities is hyperbolic so that instead of a euclidean triangle of velocities we get a lobachevski triangle of rapidities however contrary to the scientific mainstream he believed that the works of joseph larmor and hendrik lorentz were more important for relativity than the works of albert einstein and hermann minkowski
