moonlight consists of mostly sunlight with little earthlight reflected from the parts of the moons surface where the suns light strikes


 illumination 
the intensity of moonlight varies greatly depending on its phase but even the full moon typically provides only about 0.05â€“0.1 lux illumination when the moon is at perigee and viewed around upper culmination from the tropics the illuminance can reach 0.32 lux the full moon is only about one-millionth as bright as the sun
the color of moonlight particularly around full moon appears bluish to the human eye compared to most artificial light sources due to the purkinje effect moonlight is not actually tinted blue and although moonlight is often referred to as silvery it has no inherent silvery quality the moons albedo is 0.136 meaning only 13.6% of incident sunlight is reflected from the moon moonlight generally hampers astronomical viewing so astronomers usually avoid observing sessions around full moon it takes approximately 1.26 seconds for moonlight to reach earths surface


 folklore 
in folklore moonlight sometimes has a harmful influence for example sleeping in the light of a full moon on certain nights was said to transform a person into a werewolf the light of the moon was thought to worsen the symptoms of lunatics and to sleep in moonlight could make one blind or mad nyctalopia night blindness caused by a lack of vitamin a was thought to be caused by sleeping in moonlight in the tropics
moon blindness is a name for equine recurrent uveitis moonlight is no longer thought of as the cause
in the 16th century moonmilk a soft white limestone precipitate found in caves was thought to be caused by the rays of the moon
