 history 

albert einstein visited palestine in 1923 for 12 days giving the first lecture at the mount scopus campus of the hebrew university of jerusalem—two years before the university opened in 1925 menachem ussishkin the president of the zionist executive invited einstein to settle in jerusalem but this was the only visit that einstein actually made to jerusalem however einstein was a member of the universitys first board of governors in 1925 the original 46-page manuscript of the general theory of relativity ended up at the hebrew university of jerusalem
einstein did not save all of his written material but from 1919 as his fame increased he employed his stepdaughter ilse as a secretarial assistant helen dukas 1896–1982 began working for einstein with increased systematization from april 1928 although not all outgoing correspondence was saved after the nazis rise to power in 1933 einsteins son-in-law rudolf kayser aided by the french embassy rescued einsteins papers in berlin some of the material at einsteins summer house in caputh brandenburg was destroyed to avoid seizure although most of his works between 1930 and 1932 were saved that material was transported via haberlandstrasse where einstein lived in berlin then to paris and ended up stored in princeton new jersey united states until after einsteins death
einsteins 1950 will appointed helen dukas and otto nathan as trustees of the estate and stated all literary rights and assets shall be vested in the hebrew university after einsteins death in 1955 the trustees spent many years organizing einsteins papers in the 1960s helen dukas and the physicist gerald holton of harvard university in the usa reorganized the archive with the aim of publishing the material in a joint project between the hebrew university of jerusalem and princeton university press the material increased from 14,000 documents at the time of einsteins death in 1955 to around 42,000 documents in 1982 to aid in this work einsteins papers were transferred from his princeton home to the institute for advanced study at princeton university
