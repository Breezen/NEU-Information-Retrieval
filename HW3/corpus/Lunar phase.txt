the lunar phase or phase of the moon is the shape of the directly sunlit portion of the moon as viewed from earth the lunar phases gradually and cyclically change over the period of a synodic month about 29.53 days as the orbital positions of the moon around earth and of earth around the sun shift
the moons rotation is tidally locked by earths gravity therefore most of the same lunar side always faces earth this near side is variously sunlit depending on the position of the moon in its orbit thus the sunlit portion of this face can vary from 0% at new moon to 100% at full moon the lunar terminator is the boundary between the illuminated and darkened hemispheres
each of the four intermediate lunar phases see below is around 7.4 days but this varies slightly due to the elliptical shape of the moons orbit aside from some craters near the lunar poles such as shoemaker all parts of the moon see around 14.77 days of daylight followed by 14.77 days of night the side of the moon facing away from earth is sometimes called the dark side of the moon although that is a misnomer


 phases of the moon 
in western culture the four principal phases of the moon are new moon first quarter full moon and third quarter also known as last quarter these are the instances when the moons ecliptic longitude and the suns ecliptic longitude differ by 0° 90° 180° and 270° respectively each of these phases occur at slightly different times when viewed from different points on earth during the intervals between principal phases the moons apparent shape is either crescent or gibbous these shapes and the periods when the moon shows them are called the intermediate phases and last one-quarter of a synodic month or 7.38 days on average however their durations vary slightly because the moons orbit is rather elliptical so the satellites orbital speed is not constant the descriptor waxing is used for an intermediate phase when the moons apparent shape is thickening from new to full moon and waning when the shape is thinning
the eight principal and intermediate phases are given the following names in sequential order

non-western cultures may use a different number of lunar phases for example traditional hawaiian culture has a total of 30 different phases one per day


 waxing and waning 
when the sun and moon are aligned on the same side of the earth the moon is new and the side of the moon facing earth is not illuminated by the sun as the moon waxes the amount of illuminated surface as seen from earth is increasing the lunar phases progress through new moon crescent moon first-quarter moon gibbous moon and full moon the moon is then said to wane as it passes through the gibbous moon third-quarter moon crescent moon and back to new moon the terms old moon and new moon are not interchangeable the old moon is a waning sliver which eventually becomes undetectable to the naked eye until the moment it aligns with the sun and begins to wax at which point it becomes new again half moon is often used to mean the first- and third-quarter moons while the term quarter refers to the extent of the moons cycle around the earth not its shape
when an illuminated hemisphere is viewed from a certain angle the portion of the illuminated area that is visible will have a two-dimensional shape as defined by the intersection of an ellipse and circle in which the ellipses major axis coincides with the circles diameter if the half-ellipse is convex with respect to the half-circle then the shape will be gibbous bulging outwards whereas if the half-ellipse is concave with respect to the half-circle then the shape will be a crescent when a crescent moon occurs the phenomenon of earthshine may be apparent where the night side of the moon dimly reflects indirect sunlight reflected from earth


 orientation by latitude 
in the northern hemisphere if the left east side of the moon is dark then the bright part is thickening and the moon is described as waxing shifting toward full moon if the right west side of the moon is dark then the bright part is thinning and the moon is described as waning past full and shifting toward new moon assuming that the viewer is in the northern hemisphere the right side of the moon is the part that is always waxing that is if the right side is dark the moon is becoming darker if the right side is lit the moon is getting brighter
in the southern hemisphere the moon is observed from a perspective inverted or rotated 180° to that of the northern and to all of the images in this article so that the opposite sides appear to wax or wane
closer to the equator the lunar terminator will appear horizontal during the morning and evening since the above descriptions of the lunar phases only apply at middle or high latitudes and observers moving towards the tropics from northern or southern latitudes will see the moon rotated anti-clockwise or clockwise with respect to the images in this article
the lunar crescent can open upward or downward with the horns of the crescent pointing up or down respectively when the sun appears above the moon in the sky the crescent opens downward when the moon is above the sun the crescent opens upward the crescent moon is most clearly and brightly visible when the sun is below the horizon which implies that the moon must be above the sun and the crescent must open upward this is therefore the orientation in which the crescent moon is most often seen from the tropics the waxing and waning crescents look very similar the waxing crescent appears in the western sky in the evening and the waning crescent in the eastern sky in the morning


 earthshine 

when the moon as seen from earth is a narrow crescent earth as viewed from the moon is almost fully lit by the sun often the dark side of the moon is dimly illuminated by indirect sunlight reflected from earth but is bright enough to be easily visible from earth this phenomenon is called earthshine and sometimes picturesquely described as the old moon in the new moons arms or as pictured here the new moon in the old moons arms


 calendar 

the gregorian calendar month which is ​1⁄12 of a tropical year is about 30.44 days while the cycle of lunar phases the moons synodic period repeats every 29.53 days on average therefore the timing of the lunar phases shifts by an average of almost one day for each successive month a lunar year lasts about 354 days
photographing the moons phase everyday for a month starting in the evening after sunset and repeating roughly 24 hours and 50 minutes later and ending in the morning before sunrise and arranging the series of photos on a calendar would create a composite image like the example calendar may 8 – june 6 2005 shown on the left may 20 is blank because a picture would be taken before midnight on may 19 and the next after midnight on may 21
similarly on a calendar listing moonrise or moonset times some days will appear to be skipped when moonrise precedes midnight one night the next moonrise will follow midnight on the next night so too with moonset the skipped day is just a feature of the moons eastward movement in relation to the sun which at most latitudes causes the moon to rise later each day the moon follows a predictable orbit every month


 calculating phase 

each of the 4 lunar phases lasts approximately 7 days 7.4 days but varies slightly due to lunar apogee and perigee
the number of days counted from the time of the new moon is the moons age each complete cycle of phases is called a lunation
the approximate age of the moon and hence the approximate phase can be calculated for any date by calculating the number of days since a known new moon such as january 1 1900 or august 11 1999 and reducing this modulo 29.530588853 the length of a synodic month the difference between two dates can be calculated by subtracting the julian day number of one from that of the other or there are simpler formulae giving for instance the number of days since december 31 1899 however this calculation assumes a perfectly circular orbit and makes no allowance for the time of day at which the new moon happened therefore may be incorrect by several hours it also becomes less accurate the larger the difference between the required date and the reference date it is accurate enough to use in a novelty clock application showing moon phase but specialist usage taking account of lunar apogee and perigee requires a more elaborate calculation


 effect of parallax 
the earth subtends an angle of about two degrees when seen from the moon this means that an observer on earth who sees the moon when it is close to the eastern horizon sees it from an angle that is about two degrees different from the line of sight of an observer who sees the moon on the western horizon the moon moves about 12 degrees around its orbit per day so if these observers were stationary they would see the phases of the moon at times that differ by about one-sixth of a day or four hours but in reality the observers are on the surface of the rotating earth so someone who sees the moon on the eastern horizon at one moment sees it on the western horizon about 12 hours later this adds an oscillation to the apparent progression of the lunar phases they appear to occur more slowly when the moon is high in the sky than when it is below the horizon the moon appears to move jerkily and the phases do the same the amplitude of this oscillation is never more than about four hours which is a small fraction of a month it does not have any obvious effect on the appearance of the moon however it does affect accurate calculations of the times of lunar phases


 misconceptions 

it might be expected that once every month when the moon passes between earth and the sun during a new moon its shadow would fall on earth causing a solar eclipse but this does not happen every month nor is it true that during every full moon the earths shadow falls on the moon causing a lunar eclipse solar and lunar eclipses are not observed every month because the plane of the moons orbit around the earth is tilted by about 5° with respect to the plane of earths orbit around the sun the plane of the ecliptic thus when new and full moons occur the moon usually lies to the north or south of a direct line through the earth and sun although an eclipse can only occur when the moon is either new solar or full lunar it must also be positioned very near the intersection of earths orbital plane about the sun and the moons orbital plane about the earth that is at one of its nodes this happens about twice per year and so there are between four and seven eclipses in a calendar year most of these eclipses are partial total eclipses of the moon or sun are less frequent
