arthur leonard schawlow may 5 1921 – april 28 1999 was an american physicist and co-inventor of the laser with charles townes his central insight which townes overlooked was the use of two mirrors as the resonant cavity to take maser action to visible wavelengths he shared the 1981 nobel prize in physics with nicolaas bloembergen and kai siegbahn for his work on lasers


 biography 
schawlow was born in mount vernon new york his mother helen mason was from canada and his father arthur schawlow was a jewish immigrant from riga then russian empire now latvia schawlow was raised in his mothers protestant religion when arthur was three years old they moved to toronto ontario canada
at the age of 16 he completed high school at vaughan road academy then vaughan collegiate institute and received a scholarship in science at the university of toronto victoria college after earning his undergraduate degree schawlow continued in graduate school at the university of toronto which was interrupted due to world war ii at the end of the war he began work on his phd at the university with professor malcolm crawford he then took a postdoctoral position with charles townes at the physics department of columbia university in the fall of 1949
in 1951 he married aurelia townes younger sister to physicist charles hard townes and together they had three children arthur jr helen and edith arthur jr was autistic with very little speech ability
he considered himself to be an orthodox protestant christian and attended a methodist church
he went on to accept a position at bell labs in late 1951 he left in 1961 to join the faculty at stanford university as a professor he remained until he retired to emeritus status in 1996
schawlow and professor robert hofstadter at stanford who also had an autistic child teamed up to help each other find solutions to the condition arthur jr was put in a special center for autistic individuals and later schawlow put together an institution to care for people with autism in paradise california it was later named the arthur schawlow center in 1999 shortly before his death on the 29th of april 1999
schawlow was a promoter of the controversial method of facilitated communication with patients of autism
although his research focused on optics in particular lasers and their use in spectroscopy he also pursued investigations in the areas of superconductivity and nuclear resonance schawlow shared the 1981 nobel prize in physics with nicolaas bloembergen and kai siegbahn for their contributions to the development of laser spectroscopy
schawlow coauthored microwave spectroscopy 1955 with charles townes this classic text is still being used today schawlow co-invented the laser with townes in their seminal 1958 paper on optical masers aka lasers this was the first published idea on the laser and the first one was built in 1960 by ted maiman
in 1991 the nec corporation and the american physical society established a prize the arthur l schawlow prize in laser science the prize is awarded annually to candidates who have made outstanding contributions to basic research using lasers
schawlow died of leukemia in palo alto california


 awards 
1962 - stuart ballantine medal
1963 - young medal and prize for distinguished research in the field of optics presented by the institute of physics
1976 - awarded the frederic ives medal by osa
1981 - nobel prize for physics


 science and religion 
he participated in science and religion discussions regarding god he stated i find a need for god in the universe and in my own life
arthur schawlow was an intense fan and collector of traditional american jazz recordings as well as a supporter of instrumental groups performing this type of music
