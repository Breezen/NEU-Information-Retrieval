 solar eclipses 2000-2003 
each member in a semester series of solar eclipses repeats approximately every 177 days and 4 hours a semester at alternating nodes of the moons orbit
note partial solar eclipses on february 5 2000 and july 31 2000 occur in the previous lunar year set


 tritos series 
this eclipse is a part of a tritos cycle repeating at alternating nodes every 135 synodic months ≈ 3986.63 days or 11 years minus 1 month their appearance and longitude are irregular due to a lack of synchronization with the anomalistic month period of perigee but groupings of 3 tritos cycles ≈ 33 years minus 3 months come close ≈ 434.044 anomalistic months so eclipses are similar in these groupings


 metonic series 
the metonic series repeats eclipses every 19 years 6939.69 days lasting about 5 cycles eclipses occur in nearly the same calendar date in addition the octon subseries repeats 1/5 of that or every 3.8 years 1387.94 days
