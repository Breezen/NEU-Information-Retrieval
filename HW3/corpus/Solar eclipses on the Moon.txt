solar eclipses on the moon are caused when the earth passes in front of the sun blocking its light viewers on earth will see a lunar eclipse
the solar eclipses are only seen in the nearside portion and smaller parts of the farside where the earth is seen during librations making up the visible portion of the moon and eclipses there are seen during the lunar sunrise and sunset as well as furthermost areas of the nearside but mainly not in the polar areas of the moon as the moon revolves around the earth the earth rotates nearly 24 hours but its position at the sky is only in one position as it never changes as it does with some other moons or satellites in other planets or dwarf planets and a few asteroids even inside the solar system but are very rare in the outer part of the solar system
the next solar eclipse on the moon will be a total eclipse on july 27 2018 with the whole nearside and the tiny surroundings of the farside seeing totality


 length 
unlike the earth which sees its eclipse for up to 2 1/2 hours the longest in one area as the moons shadow touches for over 5 1/2 hours the longest some of the eclipses on the moon lasts for about 5 hours in one area the longest as the earths shadow touches for over 6 hours the longest
some eclipses are longer when the earth is slightly closer on earth the moon is seen with its apparent diameter is larger than the suns some eclipses are shorter when the earth is slightly further on earth the moon is seen with its apparent diameter is smaller than the suns
unlike the earth where its eclipses starts and ends at a different place all of its solar eclipses begins in the westernmost parts of the nearside and ends in the easternmost parts of the nearside
solar eclipses starting near and within the polar areas has only partial eclipses while solar eclipses starting at or within the equator has only total eclipses


 penumbral shadow 
in its eclipses the penumbral shadow does not appear until it is around 25–30% obscuration it gets slightly darker when the earth blocks the sunlight until it reaches totality in some eclipses
in some eclipses its penumbral shadow covers the whole surface whereas the center of the earths shadow missed a portion of the moon while every part of the nearside sees a partial eclipse they are very rare the last century that not all parts of the nearside and the surrounding parts of the farside saw only as partial was the 18th century on earth they are seen as a total penumbral eclipse
it is a narrow path for the moon to pass within the penumbra and outside the umbra it can happen on the earths northern or southern penumbral edges
these eclipses can last up to about over 4 1/2 hours without having any part of the moon notably especially at its poles having totality


 center of the earths shadow 
unlike the earth which receives the smallest portion being inside the center of the moons shadow during total solar eclipses during its total eclipses on the moon the center of the earths shadow covers the whole nearside part of the moon and lasts much longer than on earth with up to around 1.8 hours some total-partial eclipses have a most half or a part of the moon being in the center of the earths shadow
unlike the earth which it umbral shadow shows black as the moon has no atmosphere the surface appears not just black but red and brown according to the danjon scale because the only sunlight available is refracted through the earths atmosphere on the edges of the earth forming an atmospheric ring as it is shown in the sky in a painting by lucien rudaux


 temperatures during long totality 

during eclipses with long totality temperatures plunges but not in many parts of its mares especially oceanus procellarum and mare tranquillitatis and mid to large craters especially with basalt floor mostly in the middle portion of the moon some young craters and a few distant large craters notably tycho being located at 43.31°s where the temperatures remains high some craters are slightly cooler but as warm as the surface and warmer than areas outside the mares basins such as copernicus and langrenus


 partial eclipses 
on the moon when there is a partial eclipse one example is when half of the sun is blocked north or south a part of the moon has a partial eclipse north or south in some partial eclipses when the center of the earths shadow misses the moon one example is one hemisphere has a partial eclipse and the other does not in some eclipses when the center of the earths shadow covers a part or most one part has a total eclipse and one part has a partial eclipse partialtotal eclipses together with simiply partial last for up to about 6 hours without having totality in all parts of the nearside and a very small part of the farside next to the nearside partialtotal eclipses alone in between partial lasts for up to about 3 1/2 hours


 at its edges of the nearside and its small surroundings 
at the edges of the nearside and a small surrounding part in the farside where the earth is mostly half or partly seen in the west some solar eclipses begins at sunrise and the sun is seen after sunrise in some eclipses the sun is half seen in some eclipses it is partly eclipsed in the east some solar eclipses ends at sunset and the sun is seen before sunset in some eclipses the sun is half seen it also occur in several polar areas in that part of the moon the earth is seen in the upper parts of the crater its hills and its mountains and a few areas such as lunar seas plains in some parts it can be seen through a deep crater hollow while most or much of the lower parts around ground level and in some parts the middle parts the earth is never visible and its eclipses are never seen as the crater and its mountains including crater ones blocks the view in areas around 7–8 degrees near the farside a part of the earths view is blocked in some eclipses it begins not long after sunrise in the west and beings not long before sunset in the east at that location they are seen in higher parts and most of the middle portions
at the furthermost areas of the farside within the nearside a part of the earth is seen but only in the highest portions


 exception on one part of the moon 
much of the farside portion about 91 are free of solar eclipses as the earth is never seen there
also it is not seen in the fringes of the nearside within the farside it is not seen in the lower and most of the middle parts around it it is not seen in the lower parts also in that location and around it the eclipses are never seen in most crater hollows some of it the lowest part of some crater hollows also eclipses are never seen in crater hollows in the polar regions where the sun never shines between the 75th and the 80th parallel north or south the eclipses are never seen in most crater hollows such as the middle and notably the lowest portions


 history 
in early lunar history after around 4.3 billion years ago when the moon was formed the moon was closer to its current orbit the totality of its eclipses lasted longer the current eclipses millions of years later totality shrank and the partial portion of the eclipse was rising eclipses were more frequent tens of millions of years later eclipses became less numerous as the lunar orbit slowly moved away from the earth the view of the sun even its chromosphere was blocked by the earth around some hundreds of millions of years ago the earth blocked all of the suns chromosphere totality was slightly longer than the partial portion at the same time there were more partial eclipses on the moon as the moon recedes about 3 cm each year eclipse totality length slowly shrinks and the partial portion slowly lengthens


 saros series 
the solar saros series of the moon is the equivalent to the lunar saros series of the earth

 in popular culture 
in a package of willss cigarettes one of the tobacco cards first issued in 1928 for a few years displays the solar eclipse on the moon showing the atmospheric ring this is considered the first depiction of a solar eclipse as seen on the moon
