the heliosphere is the bubble-like region of space dominated by the sun which extends far beyond the orbit of pluto plasma blown out from the sun known as the solar wind creates and maintains this bubble against the outside pressure of the interstellar medium the hydrogen and helium gas that permeates the milky way galaxy the solar wind flows outward from the sun until encountering the termination shock where motion slows abruptly the voyager spacecraft have explored the outer reaches of the heliosphere passing through the shock and entering the heliosheath a transitional region which is in turn bounded by the outermost edge of the heliosphere called the heliopause the shape of the heliosphere is controlled by the interstellar medium through which it is traveling as well as the sun and is not perfectly spherical the limited data available and unexplored nature of these structures have resulted in many theories the word heliosphere is said to have been coined by alexander j dessler who is credited with first use of the word in the scientific literature
on september 12 2013 nasa announced that voyager 1 left the heliosphere on august 25 2012 when it measured a sudden increase in plasma density of about forty times because the heliopause marks one boundary between the suns solar wind and the rest of the galaxy a spacecraft such as voyager 1 which has departed the heliosphere can be said to have reached interstellar space


 summary 

except for regions near obstacles such as planets or comets the heliosphere is dominated by material emanating from the sun although cosmic rays fast-moving neutral atoms and cosmic dust can penetrate the heliosphere from the outside originating at the extremely hot surface of the corona solar wind particles reach escape velocity streaming outwards at 300 to 800 kms 671 thousand to 1.79 million mph or 1 to 2.9 million kmh as it begins to interact with the interstellar medium its velocity slows to a stop the point where the solar wind becomes slower than the speed of sound is called the termination shock the solar wind continues to slow as it passes through the heliosheath leading to a boundary called the heliopause where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance the termination shock was traversed by voyager 1 in 2004 and voyager 2 in 2007
it was thought that beyond the heliopause there was a bow shock but data from interstellar boundary explorer suggested the velocity of the sun through the interstellar medium is too low for it to form it may be a more gentle bow wave voyager data led to a new theory that the heliosheath has magnetic bubbles and a stagnation zone
the stagnation region within the heliosheath starting around 113 au 1.69×1010 km 1.05×1010 mi was detected by voyager 1 in 2010 there the solar wind velocity drops to zero the magnetic field intensity doubles and high-energy electrons from the galaxy increase 100-fold starting in may 2012 at 120 au 1.8×1010 km 1.1×1010 mi voyager 1 detected a sudden increase in cosmic rays an apparent signature of approach to the heliopause in december 2012 nasa announced that in late august 2012 voyager 1 at about 122 au 1.83×1010 km 1.13×1010 mi from the sun entered a new region they called the magnetic highway an area still under the influence of the sun but with some dramatic differences in the summer of 2013 nasa announced that voyager 1 had reached interstellar space as of august 25 2012
cassini and ibex data challenged the heliotail theory in 2009 in july 2013 ibex results revealed a 4-lobed tail on the solar systems heliosphere


 solar wind 

the solar wind consists of particles ionized atoms from the solar corona and fields in particular magnetic fields because the sun rotates once approximately every 25 days the magnetic field transported by the solar wind gets wrapped into a spiral variations in the suns magnetic field are carried outward by the solar wind and can produce magnetic storms in the earths own magnetosphere


 structure 


 heliospheric current sheet 

the heliospheric current sheet is a ripple in the heliosphere created by the rotating magnetic field of the sun extending throughout the heliosphere it is considered the largest structure in the solar system and is said to resemble a ballerinas skirt


 outer structure 
the outer structure of the heliosphere is determined by the interactions between the solar wind and the winds of interstellar space the solar wind streams away from the sun in all directions at speeds of several hundred kms in the earths vicinity at some distance from the sun well beyond the orbit of neptune this supersonic wind must slow down to meet the gases in the interstellar medium this takes place in several stages
the solar wind is traveling at supersonic speeds within the solar system at the termination shock a standing shock wave the solar wind falls below the speed of sound and becomes subsonic
it was previously thought that once subsonic the solar wind would be shaped by the ambient flow of the interstellar medium forming blunt nose on one side and comet-like heliotail behind a region called the heliosheath however observations in 2009 showed that this model is incorrect as of 2011 it is thought to be filled with a magnetic bubble foam
the outer surface of the heliosheath where the heliosphere meets the interstellar medium is called the heliopause this is the edge of the entire heliosphere observations in 2009 led to changes to this model
in theory the heliopause causes turbulence in the interstellar medium as the sun orbits the galactic center outside the heliopause would be a turbulent region caused by the pressure of the advancing heliopause against the interstellar medium however the velocity of solar wind relative to the interstellar medium is probably too low for a bow shock


 termination shock 

the termination shock is the point in the heliosphere where the solar wind slows down to subsonic speed relative to the sun because of interactions with the local interstellar medium this causes compression heating and a change in the magnetic field in the solar system the termination shock is believed to be 75 to 90 astronomical units from the sun in 2004 voyager 1 crossed the suns termination shock followed by voyager 2 in 2007
the shock arises because solar wind particles are emitted from the sun at about 400 kms while the speed of sound in the interstellar medium is about 100 kms the exact speed depends on the density which fluctuates considerably the interstellar medium although very low in density nonetheless has a constant pressure associated with it the pressure from the solar wind decreases with the square of the distance from the sun as one moves far enough away from the sun the pressure of the solar wind drops to where it can no longer maintain supersonic flow against the pressure of the interstellar medium at which point the solar wind slows to below its speed of sound causing a shock wave further from the sun the termination shock is followed by the heliopause where the two pressures become equal and solar wind particles are stopped by the interstellar medium
other termination shocks can be seen in terrestrial systems perhaps the easiest may be seen by simply running a water tap into a sink creating a hydraulic jump upon hitting the floor of the sink the flowing water spreads out at a speed that is higher than the local wave speed forming a disk of shallow rapidly diverging flow analogous to the tenuous supersonic solar wind around the periphery of the disk a shock front or wall of water forms outside the shock front the water moves slower than the local wave speed analogous to the subsonic interstellar medium
evidence presented at a meeting of the american geophysical union in may 2005 by ed stone suggests that the voyager 1 spacecraft passed the termination shock in december 2004 when it was about 94 au from the sun by virtue of the change in magnetic readings taken from the craft in contrast voyager 2 began detecting returning particles when it was only 76 au from the sun in may 2006 this implies that the heliosphere may be irregularly shaped bulging outwards in the suns northern hemisphere and pushed inward in the south


 heliosheath 

the heliosheath is the region of the heliosphere beyond the termination shock here the wind is slowed compressed and made turbulent by its interaction with the interstellar medium its distance from the sun is approximately 80 to 100 astronomical units au at its closest point
a proposed model hypothesizes that the heliosheath is shaped like the coma of a comet and trails several times that distance in the direction opposite to the suns path through space at its windward side its thickness is estimated to be between 10 and 100 au however observations in 2009 showed that model may be incorrect
the voyager 1 and voyager 2 spacecraft have studied the heliosheath in late 2010 voyager 1 reached a region of the heliosheath where the solar winds velocity had dropped to zero in 2011 astronomers announced that the voyagers had determined that the heliosheath is not smooth but is filled with 100 million-mile-wide bubbles created by the impact of the solar wind and the interstellar medium voyager 1 and 2 began detecting evidence for the bubbles in 2007 and 2008 respectively the probably sausage-shaped bubbles are formed by magnetic reconnection between oppositely oriented sectors of the solar magnetic field as the solar wind slows down they probably represent self-contained structures that have detached from the interplanetary magnetic field


 heliopause 
the heliopause is the theoretical boundary where the suns solar wind is stopped by the interstellar medium where the solar winds strength is no longer great enough to push back the stellar winds of the surrounding stars this is the boundary where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance the crossing of the heliopause should be signaled by a sharp drop in the temperature of charged particles a change in the direction of the magnetic field and an increase in the number of galactic cosmic rays in may 2012 voyager 1 detected a rapid increase in such cosmic rays a 9% increase in a month following a more gradual increase of 25% from jan 2009 to jan 2012 suggesting it was approaching the heliopause in the fall of 2013 nasa announced that voyager 1 had crossed the heliopause as of august 25 2012 this was at a distance of 121 au 18 billion km from the sun contrary to predictions data from voyager 1 indicates the magnetic field of the galaxy is aligned with the solar magnetic field


 heliotail 
the heliotail is the tail of the heliosphere and thus the solar systems tail it can be compared to the tail of a comet however a comets tail does not stretch behind it as it moves it is always pointing away from the sun the tail is a region where the suns solar wind slows down and ultimately escapes the heliosphere slowly evaporating because of charge exchange the shape of the heliotail newly found by nasas interstellar boundary explorer - ibex is that of a four-leaf clover the particles in the tail do not shine therefore it cannot be seen with conventional optical instruments ibex made the first observations of the heliotail by measuring the energy of energetic neutral atoms neutral particles created by collisions in the solar systems boundary zone
the tail has been shown to contain fast and slow particles the slow particles are on the side and the fast particles are encompassed in the center the shape of the tail can be linked to the sun sending out fast solar winds near its poles and slow solar wind near its equator more recently the clover-shaped tail moves further away from the sun which makes the charged particles begin to morph into a new orientation


 space beyond the heliosphere 

the heliopause is the final known boundary between the heliosphere and the interstellar space that is filled with material especially plasma not from our own star the sun but from other stars even so just outside the heliosphere ie the solar bubble there is a transitional region as detected by voyager 1 just as some interstellar pressure was detected as early as 2004 some of the suns material seeps into the interstellar medium the heliosphere is thought to reside in the local interstellar cloud inside the local bubble which is a region in the orion arm of the milky way galaxy
outside the heliosphere there is a forty-fold increase in plasma density there is also a radical reduction in the detection of certain types of particles from the sun and a large increase in galactic cosmic rays
the flow of the interstellar medium ism into the heliosphere has been measured by at least 11 different spacecraft as of 2013 by 2013 it was suspected that the direction of the flow had changed over time the flow coming from earths perspective from the constellation scorpius has probably changed direction by several degrees since the 1970s


 hydrogen wall 

according to one hypothesis there exists a region of hot hydrogen known as the hydrogen wall between the bow shock and the heliopause the wall is composed of interstellar material interacting with the edge of the heliosphere one paper released in 2013 studied the concept of a bow wave and hydrogen wall
another hypothesis suggests that the heliopause could be smaller on the side of the solar system facing the suns orbital motion through the galaxy it may also vary depending on the current velocity of the solar wind and the local density of the interstellar medium it is known to lie far outside the orbit of neptune the current mission of the voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft is to find and study the termination shock heliosheath and heliopause meanwhile the interstellar boundary explorer ibex mission is attempting to image the heliopause from earth orbit within two years of its 2008 launch initial results october 2009 from ibex suggest that previous assumptions are insufficiently cognisant of the true complexities of the heliopause
when particles emitted by the sun bump into the interstellar ones they slow down while releasing energy many particles accumulate in and around the heliopause highly energised by their negative acceleration creating a shock wave an alternative definition is that the heliopause is the magnetopause between the solar systems magnetosphere and the galaxys plasma currents


 bow shock 

it was long hypothesized that the sun produces a shock wave in its travels within the interstellar medium it would occur if the interstellar medium is moving supersonically toward the sun since its solar wind moves away from the sun supersonically when the interstellar wind hits the heliosphere it slows and creates a region of turbulence a bow shock was thought to possibly occur at about 230 au but in 2012 it was determined it probably does not exist this conclusion resulted from new measurements the velocity of the lism local interstellar medium relative to the suns was previously measured to be 26.3 kms by ulysses whereas ibex measured it at 23.2 kms
this phenomenon has been observed outside the solar system around stars other than the sun by nasas now retired orbital galex telescope the red giant star mira in the constellation cetus has been shown to have both a debris tail of ejecta from the star and a distinct shock in the direction of its movement through space at over 130 kilometers per second


 observational methods 


 detection by spacecraft 
the precise distance to and shape of the heliopause is still uncertain interplanetaryinterstellar spacecraft such as pioneer 10 pioneer 11 new horizons and voyager 2 are traveling outward through the solar system and will eventually pass through the heliopause contact to pioneer 10 and 11 has been lost


 cassini results 
rather than a comet-like shape the heliosphere appears to be bubble-shaped according to data from cassinis ion and neutral camera mimi  inca rather than being dominated by the collisions between the solar wind and the interstellar medium the inca ena maps suggest that the interaction is controlled more by particle pressure and magnetic field energy density


 ibex results 

initial data from interstellar boundary explorer ibex launched in october 2008 revealed a previously unpredicted very narrow ribbon that is two to three times brighter than anything else in the sky initial interpretations suggest that the interstellar environment has far more influence on structuring the heliosphere than anyone previously believed no one knows what is creating the ena energetic neutral atoms ribbon 
the ibex results are truly remarkable what we are seeing in these maps does not match with any of the previous theoretical models of this region it will be exciting for scientists to review these ena maps and revise the way we understand our heliosphere and how it interacts with the galaxy in october 2010 significant changes were detected in the ribbon after 6 months based on the second set of ibex observations ibex data did not support the existence of a bow shock but there might be a bow wave according to one study


 locally 

of particular interest is the earths interaction with the heliosphere but its extent and interaction with other bodies in the solar system have also been studied some examples of missions that have or continue to collect data related to the heliosphere include see also list of heliophysics missions
solar anomalous and magnetospheric particle explorer
solar and heliospheric observatory
solar dynamics observatory
stereo
ulysses spacecraft
during a total eclipse the high-temperature corona can be more readily observed from earth solar observatories during the apollo program the solar wind was measured on the moon via the solar wind composition experiment some examples of earth surface based solar observatories include the mcmath–pierce solar telescope or the newer gregor solar telescope and the refurbished big bear solar observatory


 timeline 
as of march 2005 it was reported that measurements by the solar wind anisotropies swan instrument on board the solar and heliospheric observatory soho have shown that the heliosphere the solar wind-filled volume which prevents the solar system from becoming embedded in the local ambient interstellar medium is not axisymmetrical but is distorted very likely under the effect of the local galactic magnetic field
as of 2008 there is a previously unpredicted narrow ribbon of enas
as of october 2009 the heliosphere may be bubble not comet shaped
as of october 2010 significant changes were detected in the ribbon after 6 months based on the second set of ibex observations
as of june 2011 the heliosheath area is thought to be filled with magnetic bubbles each about 1 au wide creating a foamy zone the theory helps explain in situ heliosphere measurements by the two voyager probes
as of may 2012 ibex data implies there is probably not a bow shock
as of june 2012 at 119 au voyager 1 detected an increase in cosmic rays
between late august and early september 2012 voyager 1 witnessed a sharp drop in protons from the sun from 25 particles per sec in late august to about 2 particles per second by early october it was later determined that it entered interstellar space on august 25 2012
