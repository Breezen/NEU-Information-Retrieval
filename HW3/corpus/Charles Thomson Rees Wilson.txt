charles thomson rees wilson ch frs 14 february 1869 â€“ 15 november 1959 was a scottish physicist and meteorologist who won the nobel prize in physics for his invention of the cloud chamber


 education and early life 
wilson was born in the parish of glencorse midlothian to annie clark harper and john wilson a sheep farmer after his father died in 1873 he moved with his family to manchester with financial support from his step-brother he studied biology at owens college now the university of manchester with the intent of becoming a doctor in 1887 he graduated from the college with a bsc he won a scholarship to attend sidney sussex college cambridge where he became interested in physics and chemistry in 1892 he received 1st class honours in both parts of the natural science tripos


 career 
he became particularly interested in meteorology and in 1893 he began to study clouds and their properties beginning in 1894 he worked for some time at the observatory on ben nevis where he made observations of cloud formation he was particularly fascinated by the appearance of glories he then tried to reproduce this effect on a smaller scale at the cavendish laboratory in cambridge expanding humid air within a sealed container he later experimented with the creation of cloud trails in his chamber by condensation onto ions generated by radioactivity several of his cloud chambers survive
wilson was made fellow of sidney sussex college and university lecturer and demonstrator in 1900 he was known by some as a poor lecturer due to a pronounced stutter


 contributions 
the invention of the cloud chamber was by far wilsons signature accomplishment earning him the nobel prize for physics in 1927 the cavendish laboratory praised him for the creation of a novel and striking method of investigating the properties of ionized gases the cloud chamber allowed huge experimental leaps forward in the study of subatomic particles and the field of particle physics generally some have credited wilson with making the study of particles possible at all
wilson published numerous papers on meteorology and physics on topics including x-rays ionization thundercloud formation and other meteorological events wilson may also have observed a sprite in 1924 65 years before their official discovery weather was a focus of wilsons work throughout his career from his early observations at ben nevis to his final paper on thunderclouds


 method 
retrospectively wilsons experimental method has received some attention from scholars
in a period of scientific inquiry characterized by a divide between analytical and morphological scientists wilsons method of inquiry represented a hybrid while some scientists believed phenomena should be observed in pure nature others proposed laboratory-controlled experiments as the premier method for inquiry wilson used a combination of methods in his experiments and investigations wilsons work made things visible whose properties had only previously been deduced indirectly
he has been called almost the last of the great individual experimenters in physics he used his cloud chamber in various ways to demonstrate the operating principles of things like subatomic particles and x-rays but his primary interest and the subject of the bulk of his papers was meteorology


 awards honours and legacy 
wilson was elected a fellow of the royal society frs in 1900

for the invention of the cloud chamber he received the nobel prize in physics in 1927 becoming the only scottish-born person to do so he shared this prize with arthur compton despite this great contribution to particle physics he remained interested in atmospheric physics specifically atmospheric electricity for his entire career for example his last research paper published in 1956 when he was in his late eighties at that time he was the oldest frs to publish a paper in the royal societys journals was on atmospheric electricity
the wilson crater on the moon is named for him alexander wilson and ralph elmer wilson the wilson condensation cloud formations that occur after large explosions such as nuclear detonations are named after him the wilson society the scientific society of sidney sussex college cambridge is named for him as is the ctr wilson institute for atmospheric electricity the atmospheric electricity special interest group of the royal meteorological society
the archives of charles thomson rees wilson are maintained by the archives of the university of glasgow
in 2012 the royal society of edinburgh held a meeting in honor of wilson the great scottish physicist


 personal life 
in 1908 wilson married jessie fraser the daughter of a minister from glasgow the couple had four children his family knew him as patient and curious and fond of taking walks in the hills near his home he died at his home in carlops on 15 november 1959 surrounded by his family
