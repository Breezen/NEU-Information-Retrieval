the moon is made of green cheese is a statement referring to a fanciful belief that the moon is composed of cheese in its original formulation as a proverb and metaphor for credulity with roots in fable this refers to the perception of a simpleton who sees a reflection of the moon in water and mistakes it for a round cheese wheel it is widespread as a folkloric motif among many of the worlds cultures and the notion has also found its way into childrens folklore and modern popular culture
the phrase green cheese in this proverb simply refers to a young cheese sometimes cream cheese is used though modern people may interpret the color reference literally
there was never an actual historical popular belief that the moon is made of green cheese cf the myth of the flat earth it was typically used as an example of extreme credulity a meaning that was clear and commonly understood as early as 1638


 fable 
there exists a family of stories in comparative mythology in diverse countries that concern a simpleton who sees a reflection of the moon and mistakes it for a round cheese

 the servian tale where the fox leads the wolf to believe the moon reflection in the water is a cheese and the wolf bursts in the attempt to drink up the water to get at the cheese the zulu tale of the hyena that drops the bone to go after the moon reflection in the water the gascon tale of the peasant watering his ass on a moonlight night a cloud obscures the moon and the peasant thinking the ass has drunk the moon kills the beast to recover the moon the turkish tale of the khoja nasru-d-din who thinks the moon has fallen into the well and gets a rope and chain with which to pull it out in his efforts the rope breaks and he falls back but seeing the moon in the sky praises allah that the moon is safe the scotch tale of the wolf fishing with his tail for the moon reflection


 the wolf and the fox story type 
this folkloric motif is first recorded in literature during the high middle ages by the french rabbi rashi with a rabbinic parable in his commentary weaving together three biblical quotations given in the main text including one on sour grapes into a reconstruction of some of the talmudic rabbi meirs supposed three hundred fox fables משלות שועלים in later works משלי שועלים in the tractate sanhedrin

a fox once craftily induced a wolf to go and join the jews in their sabbath preparations and share in their festivities on his appearing in their midst the jews fell upon him with sticks and beat him he therefore came back determined to kill the fox but the latter pleaded it is no fault of mine that you were beaten but they have a grudge against your father who once helped them in preparing their banquet and then consumed all the choice bits and was i beaten for the wrong done by my father cried the indignant wolf yes replied the fox the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge however he continued come with me and i will supply you with abundant food he led him to a well which had a beam across it from either end of which hung a rope with a bucket attached the fox entered the upper bucket and descended into the well whilst the lower one was drawn up where are you going asked the wolf the fox pointing to the cheese-like reflection of the moon replied here is plenty of meat and cheese get into the other bucket and come down at once the wolf did so and as he descended the fox was drawn up and how am i to get out demanded the wolf ah said the fox the righteous is delivered out of trouble and the wicked cometh in his stead is it not written just balances just weights

rashi as the first literary reference may reflect the well-known beast fable tradition of french folklore or a more obscure such tradition in jewish folklore see also the tradition in berechiah ha-nakdan the near-contemporary iraqi rabbi hai gaon also reconstructed this rabbi meir tale sharing some elements of rashis story but with a lion caught in a trapping pit rather than a wolf in a well — however rashi may have actively adapted contemporary french folklore to the talmudic passage as was homiletically practiced in different jewish communities though the tale itself is probably of non-jewish european origin rashis form and elements are likely closer to the original in oral folklore than the somewhat later variation recorded featuring reynard rashis version already includes the fox the wolf the well and the moon that are seen in later versions petrus alphonsi a spanish jewish convert to christianity popularized this tale in europe in his collection disciplina clericalis

the variation featuring reynard the fox appeared soon after petrus alphonsi in the french classic le roman de renart as renart et ysengrin dans le puits in branch iv the mooncheese element is absent it is replaced by a promise of paradise at the bottom of the well but such a version is alluded to in another part of the collection this was the first reynard tale to be adapted into english as the middle english þe vox and þe wolf preceding chaucers the nuns priests tale and the much later work of william caxton later still the middle scots the fox the wolf and the husbandman does include the mooncheese element la fontaine includes the story in the french classic compilation fables le loup et le renard in book xi the german tale of the wolf and the fox in grimm replaces the well with a well-stocked cellar where a newly satiated wolf is trapped and subject to the farmers revenge being now too overstuffed to escape through the exit
one of the facets of this morphology is grouped as the wolf dives into the water for reflected cheese type 34 of the aarne–thompson classification of folktales where the moons reflection is mistaken for cheese in the section devoted to tales of the clever fox it can also be grouped as the moon in the well type 1335a in the section devoted to stories about a fool referring to stories where the simpleton believes the moon itself is a tangible object in the water
the use of the words the moon is made of green cheese in a passive sentence creates a dilemma of syntax depending upon whether it is considered to be a phrase and its larger context


 proverb 
the moon is made of green cheese was one of the most popular proverbs in 16th and 17th-century english literature and it was also in use after this time it likely originated in this formulation in 1546 when the proverbs of john heywood claimed the moon is made of a greene cheese a common variation at that time was to make one believe the moon is made of green cheese ie to hoax
in french there is the proverb il veut prendre la lune avec les dents he wants to take the moon with his teeth alluded to in rabelais
the characterization is also common in stories of gothamites including the moonrakers of wiltshire who were said to have taken advantage of this trope and the assumption of their own naivete to hide their smuggling activities from government officials


 childlore and popular culture 
a 1902 survey of childlore by psychologist g stanley hall in the united states found that though most young children were unsure of the moons composition that it was made of cheese was the single most common explanation

careful inquiry and reminiscence concerning the substance of the moon show that eighteen children of 423 averaging five years thought it made of cheese sometime the mice eat it horseshoe-shaped or that it could be fed by throwing cheese up so clouds could catch it or it was green because the man in the moon fed on green grass its spots were mould it was really green but looked yellow because wrapped in yellow cheese cloth it was cheese mixed with wax or with melted lava which might be edible there were many rats mice and skippers there it grew big from a starry speck of light by eating cheese

before that time and since the idea of the moon actually being made of cheese has appeared as a humorous conceit in much of childrens popular culture with astronomical themes cf the man in the moon and in adult references to it
