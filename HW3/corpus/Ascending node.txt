an orbital node is either of the two points where an orbit intersects a plane of reference to which it is inclined a non-inclined orbit which is contained in the reference plane has no nodes


 planes of reference 
common planes of reference include the following
for a geocentric orbit earths equatorial plane in this case non-inclined orbits are called equatorial
for a heliocentric orbit the ecliptic or invariable plane in this case non-inclined orbits are called ecliptic
for an orbit outside the solar system the plane through the primary perpendicular to a line through the observer and the primary called the plane of the sky


 node distinction 

if a reference direction from one side of the plane of reference to the other is defined the two nodes can be distinguished for geocentric and heliocentric orbits the ascending node or north node is where the orbiting object moves north through the plane of reference and the descending node or south node is where it moves south through the plane in the case of objects outside the solar system the ascending node is the node where the orbiting secondary passes away from the observer and the descending node is the node where it moves towards the observer p 137
the position of the node may be used as one of a set of parameters called orbital elements which describe the orbit this is done by specifying the longitude of the ascending node or sometimes the longitude of the node
the line of nodes is the intersection of the objects orbital plane with the plane of reference it passes through the two nodes


 symbols and nomenclature 
the symbol of the ascending node is  unicode u260a ☊ and the symbol of the descending node is  unicode u260b ☋ in medieval and early modern times the ascending and descending nodes were called the dragons head latin caput draconis arabic ras al-jauzahar and dragons tail latin cauda draconis respectively p 141  p 245 these terms originally referred to the times when the moon crossed the apparent path of the sun in the sky also corruptions of the arabic term such as ganzaar genzahar geuzaar and zeuzahar were used in the medieval west to denote either of the nodes pp 196–197  p 65  pp 95–96 the greek terms αναβιβάζων and καταβιβάζων were also used for the ascending and descending nodes giving rise to the english words anabibazon and catabibazon  ¶27


 lunar nodes 

for the orbit of the moon around earth the plane is taken to be the ecliptic not the equatorial plane the gravitational pull of the sun upon the moon causes its nodes to gradually precess westward completing a cycle in approximately 18.6 years
