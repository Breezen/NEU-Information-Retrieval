the bohr–einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between albert einstein and niels bohr their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science an account of the debates was written by bohr in an article titled discussions with einstein on epistemological problems in atomic physics despite their differences of opinion regarding quantum mechanics bohr and einstein had a mutual admiration that was to last the rest of their lives
the debates represent one of the highest points of scientific research in the first half of the twentieth century because it called attention to an element of quantum theory quantum non-locality which is central to our modern understanding of the physical world the consensus view of professional physicists has been that bohr proved victorious in his defense of quantum theory and definitively established the fundamental probabilistic character of quantum measurement


 pre-revolutionary debates 
einstein was the first physicist to say that plancks discovery of the quantum h would require a rewriting of the laws of physics to support his point in 1905 he proposed that light sometimes acts as a particle which he called a light quantum see photon and wave–particle duality bohr was one of the most vocal opponents of the photon idea and did not openly embrace it until 1925 the photon appealed to einstein because he saw it as a physical reality although a confusing one behind the numbers bohr disliked it because it made the choice of mathematical solution arbitrary he did not like a scientists having to choose between equations
1913 brought the bohr model of the hydrogen atom which made use of the quantum to explain the atomic spectrum einstein was at first skeptical but quickly changed his mind and admitted his shift in mindset


 the quantum revolution 
the quantum revolution of the mid-1920s occurred under the direction of both einstein and bohr and their post-revolutionary debates were about making sense of the change the shocks for einstein began in 1925 when werner heisenberg introduced matrix equations that removed the newtonian elements of space and time from any underlying reality the next shock came in 1926 when max born proposed that mechanics were to be understood as a probability without any causal explanation
einstein rejected this interpretation in a 1926 letter to max born einstein wrote i at any rate am convinced that he god does not throw dice
at the fifth solvay conference held in october 1927 heisenberg and born concluded that the revolution was over and nothing further was needed it was at that last stage that einsteins skepticism turned to dismay he believed that much had been accomplished but the reasons for the mechanics still needed to be understood
einsteins refusal to accept the revolution as complete reflected his desire to see developed a model for the underlying causes from which these apparent random statistical methods resulted he did not reject the idea that positions in space-time could never be completely known but did not want to allow the uncertainty principle to necessitate a seemingly random non-deterministic mechanism by which the laws of physics operated einstein himself was a statistical thinker but disagreed that no more needed to be discovered and clarified bohr meanwhile was dismayed by none of the elements that troubled einstein he made his own peace with the contradictions by proposing a principle of complementarity that emphasized the role of the observer over the observed


 post-revolution first stage 
as mentioned above einsteins position underwent significant modifications over the course of the years in the first stage einstein refused to accept quantum indeterminism and sought to demonstrate that the principle of indeterminacy could be violated suggesting ingenious thought experiments which should permit the accurate determination of incompatible variables such as position and velocity or to explicitly reveal simultaneously the wave and the particle aspects of the same process


 einsteins argument 
the first serious attack by einstein on the orthodox conception took place during the fifth solvay international conference on electrons and photons in 1927 einstein pointed out how it was possible to take advantage of the universally accepted laws of conservation of energy and of impulse momentum in order to obtain information on the state of a particle in a process of interference which according to the principle of indeterminacy or that of complementarity should not be accessible

in order to follow his argumentation and to evaluate bohrs response it is convenient to refer to the experimental apparatus illustrated in figure a a beam of light perpendicular to the x axis propagates in the direction z and encounters a screen s1 with a narrow relative to the wavelength of the ray slit after having passed through the slit the wave function diffracts with an angular opening that causes it to encounter a second screen s2 with two slits the successive propagation of the wave results in the formation of the interference figure on the final screen f
at the passage through the two slits of the second screen s2 the wave aspects of the process become essential in fact it is precisely the interference between the two terms of the quantum superposition corresponding to states in which the particle is localized in one of the two slits which implies that the particle is guided preferably into the zones of constructive interference and cannot end up in a point in the zones of destructive interference in which the wave function is nullified it is also important to note that any experiment designed to evidence the corpuscular aspects of the process at the passage of the screen s2 which in this case reduces to the determination of which slit the particle has passed through inevitably destroys the wave aspects implies the disappearance of the interference figure and the emergence of two concentrated spots of diffraction which confirm our knowledge of the trajectory followed by the particle
at this point einstein brings into play the first screen as well and argues as follows since the incident particles have velocities practically perpendicular to the screen s1 and since it is only the interaction with this screen that can cause a deflection from the original direction of propagation by the law of conservation of impulse which implies that the sum of the impulses of two systems which interact is conserved if the incident particle is deviated toward the top the screen will recoil toward the bottom and vice versa in realistic conditions the mass of the screen is so large that it will remain stationary but in principle it is possible to measure even an infinitesimal recoil if we imagine taking the measurement of the impulse of the screen in the direction x after every single particle has passed we can know from the fact that the screen will be found recoiled toward the top bottom whether the particle in question has been deviated toward the bottom or top and therefore through which slit in s2 the particle has passed but since the determination of the direction of the recoil of the screen after the particle has passed cannot influence the successive development of the process we will still have an interference figure on the screen f the interference takes place precisely because the state of the system is the superposition of two states whose wave functions are non-zero only near one of the two slits on the other hand if every particle passes through only the slit b or the slit c then the set of systems is the statistical mixture of the two states which means that interference is not possible if einstein is correct then there is a violation of the principle of indeterminacy


 bohrs response 
bohrs response was to illustrate einsteins idea more clearly using the diagram in figure c figure c shows a fixed screen s1 that is bolted down then try to imagine one that can slide up or down along a rod instead of a fixed bolt bohr observes that extremely precise knowledge of any potential vertical motion of the screen is an essential presupposition in einsteins argument in fact if its velocity in the direction x before the passage of the particle is not known with a precision substantially greater than that induced by the recoil that is if it were already moving vertically with an unknown and greater velocity than that which it derives as a consequence of the contact with the particle then the determination of its motion after the passage of the particle would not give the information we seek however bohr continues an extremely precise determination of the velocity of the screen when one applies the principle of indeterminacy implies an inevitable imprecision of its position in the direction x before the process even begins the screen would therefore occupy an indeterminate position at least to a certain extent defined by the formalism now consider for example the point d in figure a where the interference is destructive it is obvious that any displacement of the first screen would make the lengths of the two paths a–b–d and a–c–d different from those indicated in the figure if the difference between the two paths varies by half a wavelength at point d there will be constructive rather than destructive interference the ideal experiment must average over all the possible positions of the screen s1 and for every position there corresponds for a certain fixed point f a different type of interference from the perfectly destructive to the perfectly constructive the effect of this averaging is that the pattern of interference on the screen f will be uniformly grey once more our attempt to evidence the corpuscular aspects in s2 has destroyed the possibility of interference in f which depends crucially on the wave aspects

it should be noted that as bohr recognized for the understanding of this phenomenon it is decisive that contrary to genuine instruments of measurement these bodies along with the particles would constitute in the case under examination the system to which the quantum-mechanical formalism must apply with respect to the precision of the conditions under which one can correctly apply the formalism it is essential to include the entire experimental apparatus in fact the introduction of any new apparatus such as a mirror in the path of a particle could introduce new effects of interference which influence essentially the predictions about the results which will be registered at the end further along bohr attempts to resolve this ambiguity concerning which parts of the system should be considered macroscopic and which not
in particular it must be very clear thatthe unambiguous use of spatiotemporal concepts in the description of atomic phenomena must be limited to the registration of observations which refer to images on a photographic lens or to analogous practically irreversible effects of amplification such as the formation of a drop of water around an ion in a dark room
bohrs argument about the impossibility of using the apparatus proposed by einstein to violate the principle of indeterminacy depends crucially on the fact that a macroscopic system the screen s1 obeys quantum laws on the other hand bohr consistently held that in order to illustrate the microscopic aspects of reality it is necessary to set off a process of amplification which involves macroscopic apparatuses whose fundamental characteristic is that of obeying classical laws and which can be described in classical terms this ambiguity would later come back in the form of what is still called today the measurement problem
in a recent experiment an apparatus to test this debate was developed and implemented the test consisted of a free-floating molecular double slit and the momentum change of the atom scattering from it the results of this experiment were compared to quantum mechanical and semi-classical models the results revealed that the classical description of the slits used by einstein provides a surprisingly good description of the experimental results even for a microscopic system if the momentum transfer is not ascribed to a specific pathway but shared coherently and simultaneously between both


 the principle of indeterminacy applied to time and energy 

in many textbook examples and popular discussions of quantum mechanics the principle of indeterminacy is explained by reference to the pair of variables position and velocity or momentum it is important to note that the wave nature of physical processes implies that there must exist another relation of indeterminacy that between time and energy in order to comprehend this relation it is convenient to refer to the experiment illustrated in figure d which results in the propagation of a wave which is limited in spatial extension assume that as illustrated in the figure a ray which is extremely extended longitudinally is propagated toward a screen with a slit furnished with a shutter which remains open only for a very brief interval of time 
  
    
      
        δ
        t
      
    
    displaystyle delta t
   beyond the slit there will be a wave of limited spatial extension which continues to propagate toward the right
a perfectly monochromatic wave such as a musical note which cannot be divided into harmonics has infinite spatial extent in order to have a wave which is limited in spatial extension which is technically called a wave packet several waves of different frequencies must be superimposed and distributed continuously within a certain interval of frequencies around an average value such as 
  
    
      
        
          ν
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    displaystyle nu 0
   it then happens that at a certain instant there exists a spatial region which moves over time in which the contributions of the various fields of the superposition add up constructively nonetheless according to a precise mathematical theorem as we move far away from this region the phases of the various fields at any specified point are distributed causally and destructive interference is produced the region in which the wave has non-zero amplitude is therefore spatially limited it is easy to demonstrate that if the wave has a spatial extension equal to 
  
    
      
        δ
        x
      
    
    displaystyle delta x
   which means in our example that the shutter has remained open for a time 
  
    
      
        δ

        δ

        v
      
    
    displaystyle delta tdelta xv
   where v is the velocity of the wave then the wave contains or is a superposition of various monochromatic waves whose frequencies cover an interval 
  
    
      
        δ
        ν
      
    
    displaystyle delta nu 
   which satisfies the relation

  
    
      
        δ
        ν
        ≥

    displaystyle delta nu geq frac 1delta t
  
remembering that in the universal relation of planck frequency and energy are proportional

  
    
      
        e
        
        h
        ν
        
      
    
    displaystyle ehnu 
  
it follows immediately from the preceding inequality that the particle associated with the wave should possess an energy which is not perfectly defined since different frequencies are involved in the superposition and consequently there is indeterminacy in energy

  
    
      
        δ
        e
        
        h

    displaystyle delta ehdelta nu geq frac hdelta t
  
from this it follows immediately that

        δ
        t
        ≥
        h
      
    
    displaystyle delta edelta tgeq h
  
which is the relation of indeterminacy between time and energy


 einsteins second criticism 

at the sixth congress of solvay in 1930 the indeterminacy relation just discussed was einsteins target of criticism his idea contemplates the existence of an experimental apparatus which was subsequently designed by bohr in such a way as to emphasize the essential elements and the key points which he would use in his response
einstein considers a box called einsteins box see figure containing electromagnetic radiation and a clock which controls the opening of a shutter which covers a hole made in one of the walls of the box the shutter uncovers the hole for a time 
  
    
      
        δ
        t
      
    
    displaystyle delta t
   which can be chosen arbitrarily during the opening we are to suppose that a photon from among those inside the box escapes through the hole in this way a wave of limited spatial extension has been created following the explanation given above in order to challenge the indeterminacy relation between time and energy it is necessary to find a way to determine with adequate precision the energy that the photon has brought with it at this point einstein turns to his celebrated relation between mass and energy of special relativity 
  
    
      
        e
        
        m
        
          c
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    displaystyle emc2
   from this it follows that knowledge of the mass of an object provides a precise indication about its energy the argument is therefore very simple if one weighs the box before and after the opening of the shutter and if a certain amount of energy has escaped from the box the box will be lighter the variation in mass multiplied by 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    displaystyle c2
   will provide precise knowledge of the energy emitted moreover the clock will indicate the precise time at which the event of the particle’s emission took place since in principle the mass of the box can be determined to an arbitrary degree of accuracy the energy emitted can be determined with a precision 
  
    
      
        δ
        e
      
    
    displaystyle delta e
   as accurate as one desires therefore the product 
  
    
      
        δ
        e
        δ
        t
      
    
    displaystyle delta edelta t
   can be rendered less than what is implied by the principle of indeterminacy

the idea is particularly acute and the argument seemed unassailable its important to consider the impact of all of these exchanges on the people involved at the time leon rosenfeld a scientist who had participated in the congress described the event several years later
it was a real shock for bohrwho at first could not think of a solution for the entire evening he was extremely agitated and he continued passing from one scientist to another seeking to persuade them that it could not be the case that it would have been the end of physics if einstein were right but he couldnt come up with any way to resolve the paradox i will never forget the image of the two antagonists as they left the club einstein with his tall and commanding figure who walked tranquilly with a mildly ironic smile and bohr who trotted along beside him full of excitementthe morning after saw the triumph of bohr


 bohrs triumph 
the triumph of bohr consisted in his demonstrating once again that einsteins subtle argument was not conclusive but even more so in the way that he arrived at this conclusion by appealing precisely to one of the great ideas of einstein the principle of equivalence between gravitational mass and inertial mass together with the time dilation of special relativity and a consequence of these--the gravitational redshift bohr showed that in order for einsteins experiment to function the box would have to be suspended on a spring in the middle of a gravitational field in order to obtain a measurement of the weight of the box a pointer would have to be attached to the box which corresponded with the index on a scale after the release of a photon a mass 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    displaystyle m
   could be added to the box to restore it to its original position and this would allow us to determine the energy

 post-revolution second stage 

the second phase of einsteins debate with bohr and the orthodox interpretation is characterized by an acceptance of the fact that it is as a practical matter impossible to simultaneously determine the values of certain incompatible quantities but the rejection that this implies that these quantities do not actually have precise values einstein rejects the probabilistic interpretation of born and insists that quantum probabilities are epistemic and not ontological in nature as a consequence the theory must be incomplete in some way he recognizes the great value of the theory but suggests that it does not tell the whole story and while providing an appropriate description at a certain level it gives no information on the more fundamental underlying level
i have the greatest consideration for the goals which are pursued by the physicists of the latest generation which go under the name of quantum mechanics and i believe that this theory represents a profound level of truth but i also believe that the restriction to laws of a statistical nature will turn out to be transitorywithout doubt quantum mechanics has grasped an important fragment of the truth and will be a paragon for all future fundamental theories for the fact that it must be deducible as a limiting case from such foundations just as electrostatics is deducible from maxwells equations of the electromagnetic field or as thermodynamics is deducible from statistical mechanics
these thoughts of einstein would set off a line of research into hidden variable theories such as the bohm interpretation in an attempt to complete the edifice of quantum theory if quantum mechanics can be made complete in einsteins sense it cannot be done locally this fact was demonstrated by john stewart bell with the formulation of bells inequality in 1964


 post-revolution third stage 


 the argument of epr 

in 1935 einstein boris podolsky and nathan rosen developed an argument published in the magazine physical review with the title can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete based on an entangled state of two systems before coming to this argument it is necessary to formulate another hypothesis that comes out of einsteins work in relativity the principle of locality the elements of physical reality which are objectively possessed cannot be influenced instantaneously at a distance
the argument of epr was in 1957 picked up by david bohm and yakir aharonov in a paper published in physical review with the title discussion of experimental proof for the paradox of einstein rosen and podolsky the authors reformulated the argument in terms of an entangled state of two particles which can be summarized as follows
1 consider a system of two photons which at time t are located respectively in the spatially distant regions a and b and which are also in the entangled state of polarization

2 at time t the photon in region a is tested for vertical polarization suppose that the result of the measurement is that the photon passes through the filter according to the reduction of the wave packet the result is that at time t  dt the system becomes

3 at this point the observer in a who carried out the first measurement on photon 1 without doing anything else that could disturb the system or the other photon assumption r below can predict with certainty that photon 2 will pass a test of vertical polarization it follows that photon 2 possesses an element of physical reality that of having a vertical polarization
4 according to the assumption of locality it cannot have been the action carried out in a which created this element of reality for photon 2 therefore we must conclude that the photon possessed the property of being able to pass the vertical polarization test before and independently of the measurement of photon 1
5 at time t the observer in a could have decided to carry out a test of polarization at 45° obtaining a certain result for example that the photon passes the test in that case he could have concluded that photon 2 turned out to be polarized at 45° alternatively if the photon did not pass the test he could have concluded that photon 2 turned out to be polarized at 135° combining one of these alternatives with the conclusion reached in 4 it seems that photon 2 before the measurement took place possessed both the property of being able to pass with certainty a test of vertical polarization and the property of being able to pass with certainty a test of polarization at either 45° or 135° these properties are incompatible according to the formalism
6 since natural and obvious requirements have forced the conclusion that photon 2 simultaneously possesses incompatible properties this means that even if it is not possible to determine these properties simultaneously and with arbitrary precision they are nevertheless possessed objectively by the system but quantum mechanics denies this possibility and it is therefore an incomplete theory


 bohrs response 
bohrs response to this argument was published five months later than the original publication of epr in the same magazine physical review and with exactly the same title as the original the crucial point of bohrs answer is distilled in a passage which he later had republished in paul arthur schilpps book albert einstein scientist-philosopher in honor of the seventieth birthday of einstein bohr attacks assumption r of epr by stating
the statement of the criterion in question is ambiguous with regard to the expression without disturbing the system in any way naturally in this case no mechanical disturbance of the system under examination can take place in the crucial stage of the process of measurement but even in this stage there arises the essential problem of an influence on the precise conditions which define the possible types of prediction which regard the subsequent behaviour of the systemtheir arguments do not justify their conclusion that the quantum description turns out to be essentially incompletethis description can be characterized as a rational use of the possibilities of an unambiguous interpretation of the process of measurement compatible with the finite and uncontrollable interaction between the object and the instrument of measurement in the context of quantum theory


 post-revolution fourth stage 
in his last writing on the topic einstein further refined his position making it completely clear that what really disturbed him about the quantum theory was the problem of the total renunciation of all minimal standards of realism even at the microscopic level that the acceptance of the completeness of the theory implied although the majority of experts in the field agree that einstein was wrong the current understanding is still not complete see interpretation of quantum mechanics there is no scientific consensus that determinism would have been refuted
