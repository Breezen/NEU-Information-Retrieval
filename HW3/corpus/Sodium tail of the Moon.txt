the moon has been shown to have a tail of sodium atoms too faint to be detected by the human eye hundreds of thousands of kilometers long the feature was discovered in 1998 as a result of scientists from boston university observing the leonid meteor shower
the moon is constantly releasing atomic sodium as a fine dust from its surface due to photon-stimulated desorption solar wind sputtering and meteorite impacts solar radiation pressure accelerates the sodium atoms away from the sun forming an elongated tail toward the antisolar direction
the continual impacts of small meteorites produce a constant tail from the moon but the leonids have intensified it thus making it more observable from earth than usual
