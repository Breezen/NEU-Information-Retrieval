the tidal force is an apparent force that stretches a body towards the center of mass of another body due to a gradient difference in strength in gravitational field from the other body it is responsible for the diverse phenomena including tides tidal locking breaking apart of celestial bodies and formation of ring systems within roche limit and in extreme cases spaghettification of objects it arises because the gravitational force exerted on one body by another is not constant across its parts the nearest side is attracted more strongly than the farthest side it is this difference that causes a body to get stretched thus the tidal force is also known as the differential force as well as a secondary effect of the gravitational force
in celestial mechanics the expression tidal force can refer to a situation in which a body or material for example tidal water is mainly under the gravitational influence of a second body for example the earth but is also perturbed by the gravitational effects of a third body for example the moon the perturbing force is sometimes in such cases called a tidal force for example the perturbing force on the moon it is the difference between the force exerted by the third body on the second and the force exerted by the third body on the first


 explanation 

when a body body 1 is acted on by the gravity of another body body 2 the field can vary significantly on body 1 between the side of the body facing body 2 and the side facing away from body 2 figure 2 shows the differential force of gravity on a spherical body body 1 exerted by another body body 2 these so-called tidal forces cause strains on both bodies and may distort them or even in extreme cases break one or the other apart the roche limit is the distance from a planet at which tidal effects would cause an object to disintegrate because the differential force of gravity from the planet overcomes the attraction of the parts of the object for one another these strains would not occur if the gravitational field were uniform because a uniform field only causes the entire body to accelerate together in the same direction and at the same rate


 effects of tidal forces 

in the case of an infinitesimally small elastic sphere the effect of a tidal force is to distort the shape of the body without any change in volume the sphere becomes an ellipsoid with two bulges pointing towards and away from the other body larger objects distort into an ovoid and are slightly compressed which is what happens to the earths oceans under the action of the moon the earth and moon rotate about their common center of mass or barycenter and their gravitational attraction provides the centripetal force necessary to maintain this motion to an observer on the earth very close to this barycenter the situation is one of the earth as body 1 acted upon by the gravity of the moon as body 2 all parts of the earth are subject to the moons gravitational forces causing the water in the oceans to redistribute forming bulges on the sides near the moon and far from the moon
when a body rotates while subject to tidal forces internal friction results in the gradual dissipation of its rotational kinetic energy as heat in the case for the earth and earths moon the loss of rotational kinetic energy results in a gain of about 2 milliseconds per century if the body is close enough to its primary this can result in a rotation which is tidally locked to the orbital motion as in the case of the earths moon tidal heating produces dramatic volcanic effects on jupiters moon io stresses caused by tidal forces also cause a regular monthly pattern of moonquakes on earths moon
tidal forces contribute to ocean currents which moderate global temperatures by transporting heat energy toward the poles it has been suggested that in addition to other factors harmonic beat variations in tidal forcing may contribute to climate changes however no strong link has been found to date
tidal effects become particularly pronounced near small bodies of high mass such as neutron stars or black holes where they are responsible for the spaghettification of infalling matter tidal forces create the oceanic tide of earths oceans where the attracting bodies are the moon and to a lesser extent the sun tidal forces are also responsible for tidal locking tidal acceleration and tidal heating tides may also induce seismicity
by generating conducting fluids within the interior of the earth tidal forces also affect the earths magnetic field


 mathematical treatment 

for a given externally generated gravitational field the tidal acceleration at a point with respect to a body is obtained by vectorially subtracting the gravitational acceleration at the center of the body due to the given externally generated field from the gravitational acceleration due to the same field at the given point correspondingly the term tidal force is used to describe the forces due to tidal acceleration note that for these purposes the only gravitational field considered is the external one the gravitational field of the body as shown in the graphic is not relevant in other words the comparison is with the conditions at the given point as they would be if there were no externally generated field acting unequally at the given point and at the center of the reference body the externally generated field is usually that produced by a perturbing third body often the sun or the moon in the frequent example-cases of points on or above the earths surface in a geocentric reference frame
tidal acceleration does not require rotation or orbiting bodies for example the body may be freefalling in a straight line under the influence of a gravitational field while still being influenced by changing tidal acceleration
by newtons law of universal gravitation and laws of motion a body of mass m at distance r from the center of a sphere of mass m feels a force

the tidal accelerations at the surfaces of planets in the solar system are generally very small for example the lunar tidal acceleration at the earths surface along the moon-earth axis is about 1.1 × 10−7 g while the solar tidal acceleration at the earths surface along the sun-earth axis is about 0.52 × 10−7 g where g is the gravitational acceleration at the earths surface hence the tide-raising force acceleration due to the sun is about 45% of that due to the moon the solar tidal acceleration at the earths surface was first given by newton in the principia
