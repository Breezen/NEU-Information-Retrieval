a wrinkle ridge is a type of feature commonly found on lunar maria these features are low sinuous ridges formed on the mare surface that can extend for up to several hundred kilometers wrinkle ridges are tectonic features created when the basaltic lava cooled and contracted they frequently outline ring structures buried within the mare follow circular patterns outlining the mare or intersect protruding peaks they are sometimes called veins due to their resemblance to the veins that protrude from beneath the skin these are found near craters
wrinkle ridges are named with the latin designation dorsum plural dorsa the standard iau nomenclature uses the names of people to identify wrinkle ridges on the moon thus the dorsa burnet are named for thomas burnet and the dorsum owen is named after george owen of henllys

wrinkle ridges can also be found on mars for example in chryse planitia as well as on several of the asteroids that have been visited by spacecraft as well as mercury and a couple of moons of jupiter and saturn although several hypotheses have been advanced as causes of martian wrinkle ridges today they are generally considered to be of tectonic origin they involve folding and faulting they are evidence of compressional stresses in mars’ crust the stress created a crack fault where one side was pushed on top of the other side also known as a thrust fault
