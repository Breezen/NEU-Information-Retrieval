a total solar eclipse occurred on 3 may 1715 a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between earth and the sun thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the sun for a viewer on earth totality occurs in a narrow path across earths surface with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide the 1715 total eclipse was visible across england and wales northern europe and northern asia

the 1715 eclipse is known as halleys eclipse after edmond halley 1656–1742 who predicted this eclipse to within 4 minutes accuracy halley observed the eclipse from london where the city of london enjoyed 3 minutes 33 seconds of totality he also drew a predictive map showing the path of totality across england the original map was about 20 miles off the observed eclipse path mainly due to his use of inaccurate lunar ephemeris after the eclipse he corrected the eclipse path and added the path and description of the 1724 total solar eclipse
drawing upon lunar tables made by the first astronomer royal john flamsteed william whiston produced a more technical predictive eclipse map around the same time as halley both halleys and whistons maps were published by john senex in march 1715
totality was observed in england from cornwall in the south-west to lincolnshire and norfolk in the east it was also observed in ireland where large crowds turned out in dublin to watch it the weather in dublin was exceptionally cold and wet and the eminent judge joseph deane caught a fatal chill as a result
note great britain didnt adopt the gregorian calendar until 1752 so the date was at the time considered 22 april 1715
