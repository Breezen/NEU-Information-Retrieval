historically belgium lay in the area known as the low countries a somewhat larger area than the current benelux group of states that also included parts of northern france and western germany the region was called belgica in latin after the roman province of gallia belgica from the end of the middle ages until the 17th century the area of belgium was a prosperous and cosmopolitan centre of commerce and culture from the 16th century until the belgian revolution in 1830 when belgium seceded from the netherlands the area of belgium served as the battleground between many european powers causing it to be dubbed the battlefield of europe a reputation strengthened by both world wars
belgium is a federal constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance it is divided into three highly autonomous regions and three communities that exist next to each other its two largest regions are the dutch-speaking region of flanders in the north and the mostly french-speaking southern part of the wallonia region the brussels-capital region is an officially bilingual french and dutch enclave within the flemish region a german-speaking community exists in eastern wallonia belgiums linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its political history and complex system of governance made up of six different governments
belgium participated in the industrial revolution and during the course of the 20th century possessed a number of colonies in africa the second half of the 20th century was marked by rising tensions between the dutch-speaking and the french-speaking citizens fueled by differences in language and culture and the unequal economic development of flanders and wallonia this continuing antagonism has led to several far-reaching reforms resulting in a transition from a unitary to a federal arrangement during the period from 1970 to 1993 despite the reforms tensions between the groups have remained if not increased there is significant separatism particularly among the flemish controversial language laws exist such as the municipalities with language facilities and the formation of a coalition government took 18 months following the june 2010 federal election a world record unemployment in wallonia is more than double that of flanders which boomed after the war

 history 


 pre-independent belgium 

the name belgium is derived from gallia belgica a roman province in the northernmost part of gaul that before roman invasion in 100 bc was inhabited by the belgae a mix of celtic and germanic peoples a gradual immigration by germanic frankish tribes during the 5th century brought the area under the rule of the merovingian kings a gradual shift of power during the 8th century led the kingdom of the franks to evolve into the carolingian empire
the treaty of verdun in 843 divided the region into middle and west francia and therefore into a set of more or less independent fiefdoms which during the middle ages were vassals either of the king of france or of the holy roman emperor
many of these fiefdoms were united in the burgundian netherlands of the 14th and 15th centuries emperor charles v extended the personal union of the seventeen provinces in the 1540s making it far more than a personal union by the pragmatic sanction of 1549 and increased his influence over the prince-bishopric of liège
the eighty years war 1568–1648 divided the low countries into the northern united provinces belgica foederata in latin the federated netherlands and the southern netherlands belgica regia the royal netherlands the latter were ruled successively by the spanish spanish netherlands and the austrian habsburgs austrian netherlands and comprised most of modern belgium this was the theatre of most franco-spanish and franco-austrian wars during the 17th and 18th centuries
following the campaigns of 1794 in the french revolutionary wars the low countries—including territories that were never nominally under habsburg rule such as the prince-bishopric of liège—were annexed by the french first republic ending austrian rule in the region the reunification of the low countries as the united kingdom of the netherlands occurred at the dissolution of the first french empire in 1815 after the defeat of napoleon


 independent belgium 

in 1830 the belgian revolution led to the separation of the southern provinces from the netherlands and to the establishment of a catholic and bourgeois officially french-speaking and neutral independent belgium under a provisional government and a national congress since the installation of leopold i as king on 21 july 1831 now celebrated as belgiums national day belgium has been a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy with a laicist constitution based on the napoleonic code although the franchise was initially restricted universal suffrage for men was introduced after the general strike of 1893 with plural voting until 1919 and for women in 1949
the main political parties of the 19th century were the catholic party and the liberal party with the belgian labour party emerging towards the end of the 19th century french was originally the single official language adopted by the nobility and the bourgeoisie it progressively lost its overall importance as dutch became recognized as well this recognition became official in 1898 and in 1967 the parliament accepted a dutch version of the constitution
the berlin conference of 1885 ceded control of the congo free state to king leopold ii as his private possession from around 1900 there was growing international concern for the extreme and savage treatment of the congolese population under leopold ii for whom the congo was primarily a source of revenue from ivory and rubber production many congolese were killed by leopolds agents for failing to meet production quotas for ivory and rubber it is estimated that nearly 10 million were killed during the leopold period in 1908 this outcry led the belgian state to assume responsibility for the government of the colony henceforth called the belgian congo a belgian commission in 1919 estimated that congos population was half what it was in 1879
germany invaded belgium in august 1914 as part of the schlieffen plan to attack france and much of the western front fighting of world war i occurred in western parts of the country the opening months of the war were known as the rape of belgium due to german excesses belgium assumed control of the german colonies of ruanda-urundi modern-day rwanda and burundi during the war and in 1924 the league of nations mandated them to belgium in the aftermath of the first world war belgium annexed the prussian districts of eupen and malmedy in 1925 thereby causing the presence of a german-speaking minority

german forces again invaded the country in may 1940 and 40,690 belgians over half of them jews were killed during the subsequent occupation and the holocaust from september 1944 to february 1945 the allies liberated belgium after world war ii a general strike forced king leopold iii to abdicate in 1951 since many belgians felt he had collaborated with germany during the war the belgian congo gained independence in 1960 during the congo crisis ruanda-urundi followed with its independence two years later belgium joined nato as a founding member and formed the benelux group of nations with the netherlands and luxembourg
belgium became one of the six founding members of the european coal and steel community in 1951 and of the european atomic energy community and european economic community established in 1957 the latter has now become the european union for which belgium hosts major administrations and institutions including the european commission the council of the european union and the extraordinary and committee sessions of the european parliament


 geography 

belgium shares borders with france 620 km germany 167 km luxembourg 148 km and the netherlands 450 km its total surface including water area is 30,528 square kilometres from which land area alone 30,278 km2 it lies between latitudes 49°30 and 51°30 n and longitudes 2°33 and 6°24 e
belgium has three main geographical regions the coastal plain in the northwest and the central plateau both belong to the anglo-belgian basin and the ardennes uplands in the southeast to the hercynian orogenic belt the paris basin reaches a small fourth area at belgiums southernmost tip belgian lorraine
the coastal plain consists mainly of sand dunes and polders further inland lies a smooth slowly rising landscape irrigated by numerous waterways with fertile valleys and the northeastern sandy plain of the campine kempen the thickly forested hills and plateaux of the ardennes are more rugged and rocky with caves and small gorges extending westward into france this area is eastwardly connected to the eifel in germany by the high fens plateau on which the signal de botrange forms the countrys highest point at 694 metres 2,277 ft
the climate is maritime temperate with significant precipitation in all seasons köppen climate classification cfb like most of northwest europe the average temperature is lowest in january at 3 °c 37.4 °f and highest in july at 18 °c 64.4 °f the average precipitation per month varies between 54 millimetres 2.1 in for february and april to 78 mm 3.1 in for july averages for the years 2000 to 2006 show daily temperature minimums of 7 °c 44.6 °f and maximums of 14 °c 57.2 °f and monthly rainfall of 74 mm 2.9 in these are about 1 °c and nearly 10 millimetres above last centurys normal values respectively
phytogeographically belgium is shared between the atlantic european and central european provinces of the circumboreal region within the boreal kingdom according to the world wide fund for nature the territory of belgium belongs to the ecoregion of atlantic mixed forests because of its high population density industrialization and its location in the centre of western europe belgium still faces some environmental problems however due to consistent efforts by the various levels of government in belgium the state of the environment in belgium is gradually improving this led to belgium being ranked as one of the top 10 countries 9 out of 132 in terms of environmental protection trends and to belgium being ranked in 2012 as the 24th country out of 132 for environmental protection belgium moreover has one of europes highest waste recycling rates in particular the flemish region of belgium has the highest waste diversion rate in europe almost 75 percent of the residential waste produced there is reused recycled or composted


 provinces 

the territory of belgium is divided into three regions two of which the flemish region and walloon region are in turn subdivided into provinces the third region the brussels capital region is neither a province nor a part of a province


 politics 

belgium is a constitutional popular monarchy and a federal parliamentary democracy the bicameral federal parliament is composed of a senate and a chamber of representatives the former is made up of 50 senators appointed by the parliaments of the communities and regions and 10 co-opted senators prior to 2014 most of the senates members were directly elected the chambers 150 representatives are elected under a proportional voting system from 11 electoral districts belgium has compulsory voting and thus maintains one of the highest rates of voter turnout in the world
the king currently philippe is the head of state though with limited prerogatives he appoints ministers including a prime minister that have the confidence of the chamber of representatives to form the federal government the council of ministers is composed of no more than fifteen members with the possible exception of the prime minister the council of ministers is composed of an equal number of dutch-speaking members and french-speaking members the judicial system is based on civil law and originates from the napoleonic code the court of cassation is the court of last resort with the court of appeal one level below


 political culture 
belgiums political institutions are complex most political power is organized around the need to represent the main cultural communities since about 1970 the significant national belgian political parties have split into distinct components that mainly represent the political and linguistic interests of these communities the major parties in each community though close to the political centre belong to three main groups christian democrats liberals and social democrats further notable parties came into being well after the middle of last century mainly around linguistic nationalist or environmental themes and recently smaller ones of some specific liberal nature

a string of christian democrat coalition governments from 1958 was broken in 1999 after the first dioxin crisis a major food contamination scandal a rainbow coalition emerged from six parties the flemish and the french-speaking liberals social democrats and greens later a purple coalition of liberals and social democrats formed after the greens lost most of their seats in the 2003 election
the government led by prime minister guy verhofstadt from 1999 to 2007 achieved a balanced budget some tax reforms a labour-market reform scheduled nuclear phase-out and instigated legislation allowing more stringent war crime and more lenient soft drug usage prosecution restrictions on withholding euthanasia were reduced and same-sex marriage legalized the government promoted active diplomacy in africa and opposed the invasion of iraq it is the only country that does not have age restrictions on euthanasia
verhofstadts coalition fared badly in the june 2007 elections for more than a year the country experienced a political crisis this crisis was such that many observers speculated on a possible partition of belgium from 21 december 2007 until 20 march 2008 the temporary verhofstadt iii government was in office this coalition of the flemish and francophone christian democrats the flemish and francophone liberals together with the francophone social democrats was an interim government until 20 march 2008
on that day a new government led by flemish christian democrat yves leterme the actual winner of the federal elections of june 2007 was sworn in by the king on 15 july 2008 leterme announced the resignation of the cabinet to the king as no progress in constitutional reforms had been made in december 2008 he once more offered his resignation to the king after a crisis surrounding the sale of fortis to bnp paribas at this juncture his resignation was accepted and christian democratic and flemish herman van rompuy was sworn in as prime minister on 30 december 2008
after herman van rompuy was designated the first permanent president of the european council on 19 november 2009 he offered the resignation of his government to king albert ii on 25 november 2009 a few hours later the new government under prime minister yves leterme was sworn in on 22 april 2010 leterme again offered the resignation of his cabinet to the king after one of the coalition partners the openvld withdrew from the government and on 26 april 2010 king albert officially accepted the resignation
the parliamentary elections in belgium on 13 june 2010 saw the flemish nationalist n-va become the largest party in flanders and the socialist party ps the largest party in wallonia until december 2011 belgium was governed by letermes caretaker government awaiting the end of the deadlocked negotiations for formation of a new government by 30 march 2011 this set a new world record for the elapsed time without an official government previously held by war-torn iraq finally in december 2011 the di rupo government led by walloon socialist prime minister elio di rupo was sworn in
the 2014 federal election coinciding with the regional elections resulted in a further electoral gain for the flemish nationalist n-va although the incumbent coalition composed of flemish and french-speaking social democrats liberals and christian democrats maintains a solid majority in parliament and in all electoral constituencies on 22 july 2014 king philippe nominated charles michel mr and kris peeters cdv to lead the formation of a new federal cabinet composed of the flemish parties n-va cdv open vld and the french-speaking mr which resulted in the michel government it is the first time n-va is part of the federal cabinet while the french-speaking side is represented only by the mr which achieved a minority of the public votes in wallonia


 communities and regions 

following a usage which can be traced back to the burgundian and habsburg courts in the 19th century it was necessary to speak french to belong to the governing upper class and those who could only speak dutch were effectively second-class citizens late that century and continuing into the 20th century flemish movements evolved to counter this situation
while the people in southern belgium spoke french or dialects of french and most brusselers adopted french as their first language the flemings refused to do so and succeeded progressively in making dutch an equal language in the education system following world war ii belgian politics became increasingly dominated by the autonomy of its two main linguistic communities intercommunal tensions rose and the constitution was amended to minimise the potential for conflict
based on the four language areas defined in 1962–63 the dutch bilingual french and german language areas consecutive revisions of the countrys constitution in 1970 1980 1988 and 1993 established a unique form of a federal state with segregated political power into three levels
the federal government based in brussels
the three language communities
the flemish community dutch-speaking
the french community french-speaking
the german-speaking community

the three regions
the flemish region subdivided into five provinces
the walloon region subdivided into five provinces
the brussels-capital region

the constitutional language areas determine the official languages in their municipalities as well as the geographical limits of the empowered institutions for specific matters although this would allow for seven parliaments and governments when the communities and regions were created in 1980 flemish politicians decided to merge both thus the flemings just have one single institutional body of parliament and government is empowered for all except federal and specific municipal matters
the overlapping boundaries of the regions and communities have created two notable peculiarities the territory of the brussels-capital region which came into existence nearly a decade after the other regions is included in both the flemish and french communities and the territory of the german-speaking community lies wholly within the walloon region conflicts about jurisdiction between the bodies are resolved by the constitutional court of belgium the structure is intended as a compromise to allow different cultures to live together peacefully


 locus of policy jurisdiction 
the federal states authority includes justice defence federal police social security nuclear energy monetary policy and public debt and other aspects of public finances state-owned companies include the belgian post group and belgian railways the federal government is responsible for the obligations of belgium and its federalized institutions towards the european union and nato it controls substantial parts of public health home affairs and foreign affairs the budget—without the debt—controlled by the federal government amounts to about 50% of the national fiscal income the federal government employs around 12% of the civil servants
communities exercise their authority only within linguistically determined geographical boundaries originally oriented towards the individuals of a communitys language culture including audiovisual media education and the use of the relevant language extensions to personal matters less directly connected with language comprise health policy curative and preventive medicine and assistance to individuals protection of youth social welfare aid to families immigrant assistance services and so on
regions have authority in fields that can be broadly associated with their territory these include economy employment agriculture water policy housing public works energy transport the environment town and country planning nature conservation credit and foreign trade they supervise the provinces municipalities and intercommunal utility companies
in several fields the different levels each have their own say on specifics with education for instance the autonomy of the communities neither includes decisions about the compulsory aspect nor allows for setting minimum requirements for awarding qualifications which remain federal matters each level of government can be involved in scientific research and international relations associated with its powers the treaty-making power of the regions and communities governments is the broadest of all the federating units of all the federations all over the world


 foreign relations 

because of its location at the crossroads of western europe belgium has historically been the route of invading armies from its larger neighbours with virtually defenceless borders belgium has traditionally sought to avoid domination by the more powerful nations which surround it through a policy of mediation the belgians have been strong advocates of european integration both the european union and nato are headquartered in belgium


 armed forces 

the belgian armed forces have about 47,000 active troops in 2010 belgiums defence budget totaled €3.95 billion representing 1.12% of its gdp they are organized into one unified structure which consists of four main components land component or the army air component or the air force naval component or the navy medical component the operational commands of the four components are subordinate to the staff department for operations and training of the ministry of defence which is headed by the assistant chief of staff operations and training and to the chief of defence
the effects of the second world war made collective security a priority for belgian foreign policy in march 1948 belgium signed the treaty of brussels and then joined nato in 1948 however the integration of the armed forces into nato did not begin until after the korean war the belgians along with the luxembourg government sent a detachment of battalion strength to fight in korea known as the belgian united nations command this mission was the first in a long line of un missions which the belgians supported currently the belgian naval component is working closely together with the dutch navy under the command of the admiral benelux


 economy 

belgiums strongly globalized economy and its transport infrastructure are integrated with the rest of europe its location at the heart of a highly industrialized region helped make it the worlds 15th largest trading nation in 2007 the economy is characterized by a highly productive work force high gnp and high exports per capita belgiums main imports are raw materials machinery and equipment chemicals raw diamonds pharmaceuticals foodstuffs transportation equipment and oil products its main exports are machinery and equipment chemicals finished diamonds metals and metal products and foodstuffs
the belgian economy is heavily service-oriented and shows a dual nature a dynamic flemish economy and a walloon economy that lags behind one of the founding members of the european union belgium strongly supports an open economy and the extension of the powers of eu institutions to integrate member economies since 1922 through the belgium-luxembourg economic union belgium and luxembourg have been a single trade market with customs and currency union

belgium was the first continental european country to undergo the industrial revolution in the early 19th century liège and charleroi rapidly developed mining and steelmaking which flourished until the mid-20th century in the sambre and meuse valley and made belgium among one of the three most industrialized nations in the world from 1830 to 1910 however by the 1840s the textile industry of flanders was in severe crisis and the region experienced famine from 1846 to 1850
after world war ii ghent and antwerp experienced a rapid expansion of the chemical and petroleum industries the 1973 and 1979 oil crises sent the economy into a recession it was particularly prolonged in wallonia where the steel industry had become less competitive and experienced serious decline in the 1980s and 1990s the economic centre of the country continued to shift northwards and is now concentrated in the populous flemish diamond area
by the end of the 1980s belgian macroeconomic policies had resulted in a cumulative government debt of about 120% of gdp as of 2006 the budget was balanced and public debt was equal to 90.30% of gdp in 2005 and 2006 real gdp growth rates of 1.5% and 3.0 respectively were slightly above the average for the euro area unemployment rates of 8.4% in 2005 and 8.2% in 2006 were close to the area average by october 2010 this had grown to 8.5% compared to an average rate of 9.6% for the european union as a whole eu 27 from 1832 until 2002 belgiums currency was the belgian franc belgium switched to the euro in 2002 with the first sets of euro coins being minted in 1999 the standard belgian euro coins designated for circulation show the portrait of the monarch first king albert ii since 2013 king philippe
despite an 18% decrease observed from 1970 to 1999 belgium still had in 1999 the highest rail network density within the european union with 113.8 km1 000 km2 on the other hand the same period of time 1970–1999 has seen a huge growth 56 of the motorway network in 1999 the density of km motorways per 1000 km2 and 1000 inhabitants amounted to 55.1 and 16.5 respectively and were significantly superior to the eus means of 13.7 and 15.9

belgium experiences some of the most congested traffic in europe in 2010 commuters to the cities of brussels and antwerp spent respectively 65 and 64 hours a year in traffic jams like in most small european countries more than 80% of the airways traffic is handled by a single airport the brussels airport the ports of antwerp and zeebrugge bruges share more than 80% of belgian maritime traffic antwerp being the second european harbour with a gross weight of goods handled of 115 988 000 t in 2000 after a growth of 10.9% over the preceding five years in 2016 the port of antwerp handled 214 million tons after a year-on-year growth of 2.7
there is a large economic gap between flanders and wallonia wallonia was historically wealthy compared to flanders mostly due to its heavy industries but the decline of the steel industry post-world war ii led to the regions rapid decline whereas flanders rose swiftly since then flanders has been prosperous among the wealthiest regions in europe whereas wallonia has been languishing as of 2007 the unemployment rate of wallonia is over double that of flanders the divide has played a key part in the tensions between the flemish and walloons in addition to the already-existing language divide pro-independence movements have gained high popularity in flanders as a consequence the separatist new flemish alliance n-va party for instance is the largest party in belgium


 science and technology 

contributions to the development of science and technology have appeared throughout the countrys history the 16th century early modern flourishing of western europe included cartographer gerardus mercator anatomist andreas vesalius herbalist rembert dodoens and mathematician simon stevin among the most influential scientists
chemist ernest solvay and engineer zenobe gramme école industrielle de liège gave their names to the solvay process and the gramme dynamo respectively in the 1860s bakelite was developed in 1907–1909 by leo baekeland ernest solvay also acted as a major philanthropist and gave its name to the solvay institute of sociology the solvay brussels school of economics and management and the international solvay institutes for physics and chemistry which are now part of the université libre de bruxelles in 1911 he started a series of conferences the solvay conferences on physics and chemistry which have had a deep impact on the evolution of quantum physics and chemistry a major contribution to fundamental science was also due to a belgian monsignor georges lemaître catholic university of leuven who is credited with proposing the big bang theory of the origin of the universe in 1927
three nobel prizes in physiology or medicine were awarded to belgians jules bordet université libre de bruxelles in 1919 corneille heymans university of ghent in 1938 and albert claude université libre de bruxelles together with christian de duve université catholique de louvain in 1974 françois englert université libre de bruxelles was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 2013 ilya prigogine université libre de bruxelles was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in 1977 two belgian mathematicians have been awarded the fields medal pierre deligne in 1978 and jean bourgain in 1994

 functional urban areas 


 languages 

belgium has three official languages dutch french and german a number of non-official minority languages are spoken as well as no census exists there are no official statistical data regarding the distribution or usage of belgiums three official languages or their dialects however various criteria including the languages of parents of education or the second-language status of foreign born may provide suggested figures an estimated 60% of the belgian population speaks dutch often referred to as flemish and 40% of the population speaks french french-speaking belgians are often referred to as walloons although the french speakers in brussels are not walloons
total dutch speakers are 6.23 million concentrated in the northern flanders region while french speakers number 3.32 million in wallonia and an estimated 870,000 or 85 in the officially bilingual brussels-capital region the german-speaking community is made up of 73,000 people in the east of the walloon region around 10,000 german and 60,000 belgian nationals are speakers of german roughly 23,000 more german speakers live in municipalities near the official community

 religion 

since the countrys independence roman catholicism counterbalanced by strong freethought movements has had an important role in belgiums politics however belgium is largely a secular country as the laicist constitution provides for freedom of religion and the government generally respects this right in practice during the reigns of albert i and baudouin the monarchy had a reputation of deeply rooted catholicism
roman catholicism has traditionally been belgiums majority religion being especially strong in flanders however by 2009 sunday church attendance was 5% for belgium in total 3% in brussels and 5.4% in flanders church attendance in 2009 in belgium was roughly half of the sunday church attendance in 1998 11% for the total of belgium in 1998 despite the drop in church attendance catholic identity nevertheless remains an important part of belgiums culture
according to the eurobarometer 2010 37% of belgian citizens responded that they believe there is a god 31% answered that they believe there is some sort of spirit or life-force 27% answered that they do not believe there is any sort of spirit god or life-force 5% did not respond according to the eurobarometer 2015 60.7% of the total population of belgium adhered to christianity with roman catholicism being the largest denomination with 52.9 protestants comprised 2.1% and orthodox christians were the 1.6% of the total non religious people comprised the 32.0% of the population and were divided between atheists 14.9 and agnostics 17.1 a further 5.2% of the population was muslim and 2.1% were believers in other religions the same survey held in 2012 found that christianity was the largest religion in belgium accounting 65% of belgians
