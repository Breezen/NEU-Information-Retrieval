the daguerreotype  french daguerréotype process or daguerreotypy was the first publicly available photographic process and for nearly twenty years it was the one most commonly used
invented by louis-jacques-mandé daguerre and introduced worldwide in 1839 daguerreotype was almost completely superseded by 1860 with new less expensive processes yielding more readily viewable images during the past few decades there has been a small revival of daguerreotypy among photographers interested in making artistic use of early photographic processes
to make the image a daguerreotypist would polish a sheet of silver-plated copper to a mirror finish treat it with fumes that made its surface light sensitive expose it in a camera for as long as was judged to be necessary which could be as little as a few seconds for brightly sunlit subjects or much longer with less intense lighting make the resulting latent image on it visible by fuming it with mercury vapor remove its sensitivity to light by liquid chemical treatment rinse and dry it then seal the easily marred result behind glass in a protective enclosure
the image is on a mirror-like silver surface normally kept under glass and will appear either positive or negative depending on the angle at which it is viewed how it is lit and whether a light or dark background is being reflected in the metal the darkest areas of the image are simply bare silver lighter areas have a microscopically fine light-scattering texture the surface is very delicate and even the lightest wiping can permanently scuff it some tarnish around the edges is normal
several types of antique photographs most often ambrotypes and tintypes but sometimes even old prints on paper are very commonly misidentified as daguerreotypes especially if they are in the small ornamented cases in which daguerreotypes made in the us and uk were usually housed the name daguerreotype correctly refers only to one very specific image type and medium the product of a process that was in wide use only from the early 1840s to the late 1850s


 history 

since the renaissance era artists and inventors had searched for a mechanical method of capturing visual scenes using the camera obscura artists would manually trace what they saw or use the optical image in the camera as a basis for solving the problems of perspective and parallax and deciding color values the camera obscuras optical reduction of a real scene in three-dimensional space to a flat rendition in two dimensions influenced western art so that at one point it was thought that images based on optical geometry perspective belonged to a more advanced civilization later with the advent of modernism the absence of perspective in oriental art from china japan and in persian miniatures was revalued in the early seventeenth century the italian physician and chemist angelo sala wrote that powdered silver nitrate was blackened by the sun but did not find any practical application of the phenomenon
the discovery and commercial availability of the halides iodine bromine and chlorine a few years earlier iodine was discovered by courtois in 1811 bromine by löwig in 1825 and balard in 1826 independently and chlorine by scheele in 1774 meant that silver photographic processes that rely on the reduction of silver iodide silver bromide and silver chloride to metallic silver became feasible the daguerreotype is one of these processes but was not the first as niépce had experimented with paper silver chloride negatives while wedgwoods experiments were with silver nitrate as were schultzes stencils of letters hippolyte bayard had been persuaded by arago to wait before making his paper process public
previous discoveries of photosensitive methods and substances—including silver nitrate by albertus magnus in the 13th century a silver and chalk mixture by johann heinrich schulze in 1724 and joseph niépces bitumen-based heliography in 1822 contributed to development of the daguerreotype
the first reliably documented attempt to capture the image formed in a camera obscura was made by thomas wedgwood as early as the 1790s but according to an 1802 account of his work by sir humphry davy

the images formed by means of a camera obscura have been found too faint to produce in any moderate time an effect upon the nitrate of silver to copy these images was the first object of mr wedgwood in his researches on the subject and for this purpose he first used the nitrate of silver which was mentioned to him by a friend as a substance very sensible to the influence of light but all his numerous experiments as to their primary end proved unsuccessful


 development in france 
in 1829 french artist and chemist louis-jacques-mandé daguerre when obtaining a camera obscura for his work on theatrical scene painting from the optician chevalier was put into contact with nicéphore niépce who had already managed to make a record of an image from a camera obscura using the process he invented heliography
daguerre met with niépce and entered into correspondence with him niépce had invented an early internal combustion engine the pyréolophore together with his brother claude and made improvements to the velocipede as well as experimenting with lithography and related processes their correspondence reveals that niépce was at first reluctant to divulge any details of his work with photographic images to guard against letting any secrets out before the invention had been improved they used a numerical code for security 15 for example signified the tanning action of the sun on human skin action solaire sur les corps 34 – a camera obscura chambre noir 73 – sulphuric acid

the written contract drawn up between nicéphore niépce and daguerre  includes an undertaking by niépce to release details of the process he had invented – the asphalt process or heliography daguerre was sworn to secrecy under penalty of damages and undertook to design a camera and improve the process the improved process was eventually named the physautotype
niépces early experiments had derived from his interest in lithography and centered around capturing the image in a camera then called a camera obscura to result in an engraving that could be printed somehow by lithography the asphalt process or heliography required exposures that were so long that arago said it was not fit for use nevertheless without niépces experiments it is unlikely that daguerre would have been able to build on them to adapt and improve what turned out to be the daguerreotype process
after niépces death in 1833 his son isidore inherited rights in the contract and a new version was drawn up between daguerre and isidore isidore signed the document admitting that the old process had been improved to the limits that were possible and that a new process that would bear daguerres name alone was sixty to eighty times as rapid as the old asphalt bitumen one his father had invented this was the daguerreotype process that used iodized silvered plates and was developed with mercury fumes
to exploit the invention four hundred shares would be on offer for a thousand francs each secrecy would be lifted after a hundred shares had been sold or the rights of the process could be bought for twenty thousand francs
daguerre wrote to isidore niepce on 2 january 1839 about his discussion with arago

he sees difficulty with this proceeding by subscription it is almost certain — just as i myself have been convinced ever since looking on my first specimens — that subscription would not serve everyone says it is superb but it will cost us the thousand francs before we learn it the process and be able to judge if it could remain secret m de mandelot himself knows several persons who could subscribe but will not do so because they think it the secret would be revealed by itself and now i have proof that many think in this way i entirely agree with the idea of m arago that is get the government to purchase this discovery and that he himself would pursue this in the chambre i have already seen several deputies who are of the same opinion and would give support  this way it seems to me to have the most chance of success thus my dear friend i think it is the best option and everything makes me think we will not regret it for a start m arago will speak next monday at the académie des sciences 

isidore did not contribute anything to the invention of the daguerreotype and he was not let in on the details of the invention nevertheless he benefited from the state pension awarded to him together with daguerre
miles berry a patent agent acting on daguerres and isidore niépces behalf in england wrote a six-page memorial to the board of the treasury in an attempt to repeat the french arrangement in great britain for the purpose of throwing it open in england for the benefit of the public

inform party that parliament has placed no funds
at the disposal of the treasury
from which a purchase of this description could be made
indecipherable signature

the treasury wrote to miles berry on 3 april to inform him of their decision

to miles berry esq 66 chancery lane
sir
having laid before the lords c your application on behalf of messrs daguerre  niepce that government would purchase their patent right to the invention known as the daguerreotype i have it in command to acquaint you that parliament has placed no funds at the disposal of their lordships from which a purchase of this description could be made
3rd april 1840 signed a gordon
entry in margin application refused

without bills being passed by parliament as had been arranged in france arago having presented a bill in the house of deputies and gay-lussac in the chamber of peers there was no possibility of repeating the french arrangement in england which is why the daguerreotype was given free to the world by the french government with the exception of england and wales for which richard beard controlled the patent rights
daguerre patented his process in england and richard beard patented his improvements to the process in scotland during this time the astronomer and member of the house of deputies françois arago had sought a solution whereby the invention would be given free to the world by the passing of acts in the french parliament richard beard controlled most of the licences in england and wales with the exception of antoine claudet who had purchased a licence directly from daguerre
in the us alexander s wolcott invented the mirror daguerreotype camera according to john johnsons account in one single day after reading the description of the daguerreotype process published in english translation
johnsons father travelled to england with some specimen portraits to patent the camera and met with richard beard who bought the patent for the camera and a year later bought the patent for the daguerreotype outright johnson assisted beard in setting up a portrait studio on the roof of the regent street polytechnic and managed beards daguerreotype studio in derby and then manchester for some time before returning to the us
wolcotts mirror camera that gave postage stamp sized miniatures was in use for about two years before it was replaced by petzvals portrait lens that gave larger and sharper images
antoine claudet had purchased a licence from daguerre directly to produce daguerreotypes
his uncle the banker vital roux arranged that he should head the glass factory at choisy-le-roi together with georges bontemps and moved to england to represent the factory with a showroom in high holborn at one stage beard sued claudet with the aim of claiming that he had a monopoly of daguerreotypy in england but lost niépces aim originally had been to find a method to reproduce prints and drawings for lithography he had started out experimenting with light sensitive materials and had made a contact print from a drawing and then went on to successfully make the first photomechanical record of an image in a camera obscura — the worlds first photograph niépces method was to coat a pewter plate with bitumen of judea asphalt and the action of the light differentially hardened the bitumen the plate was washed with a mixture of oil of lavender and turpentine leaving a relief image later daguerres and niépces improvement to the heliograph process the physautotype reduced the exposure to eight hours
early experiments required hours of exposure in the camera to produce visible results modern photo-historians consider the stories of daguerre discovering mercury development by accident because of a bowl of mercury left in a cupboard or alternatively a broken thermometer to be spurious 
another story of a fortunate accident which modern photohistorians are now doubtful about and was related by louis figuier of a silver spoon lying on an iodized silver plate which left its design on the plate by light perfectly noticing this daguerre supposedly wrote to niépce on 21 may 1831 suggesting the use of iodized silver plates as a means of obtaining light images in the camera
daguerre did not give a clear account of his method of discovery and allowed these legends to become current after the secrecy had been lifted
letters from niépce to daguerre dated 24 june and 8 november 1831 show that niépce was unsuccessful in obtaining satisfactory results following daguerres suggestion although he had produced a negative on an iodized silver plate in the camera niépces letters to daguerre dated 29 january and 3 march 1832 show that the use of iodized silver plates was due to daguerre and not niépce
jean-baptiste dumas who was president of the national society for the encouragement of science société dencouragement pour lindustrie nationale and a chemist put his laboratory at daguerres disposal according to austrian chemist josef maria eder daguerre was not versed in chemistry and it was dumas who suggested daguerre use sodium hyposulfite discovered by herschel in 1819 as a fixer to dissolve the unexposed silver salts


 first mention in print 1835 and public announcement 1839 
a paragraph tacked onto the end of a review of one of daguerres diorama spectacles in the journal des artistes on 27 september 1835 a diorama painting of a landslide that occurred in la vallée de goldau made passing mention of rumour that was going around the paris studios of daguerres attempts to make a visual record on metal plates of the fleeting image produced by the camera obscura

it is said that daguerre has found the means to collect on a plate prepared by him the image produced by the camera obscura in such a way that a portrait a landscape or any view projected upon this plate by the ordinary camera obscura leaves an imprint in light and shade there and thus presents the most perfect of all drawings  a preparation put over this image preserves it for an indefinite time  the physical sciences have perhaps never presented a marvel comparable to this one

a further clue to fixing the date of invention of the process is that when the paris correspondent of the london periodical the athenaeum reported the public announcement of the daguerreotype in 1839 he mentioned that the daguerreotypes now being produced were considerably better than the ones he had seen four years earlier
at a joint meeting of the french academy of sciences and the académie des beaux-arts held at the institut de françe on monday 19 august 1839françois arago briefly referred to the earlier process that niépce had developed and daguerre had helped to improve without mentioning them by name the heliograph and the physautotype in rather disparaging terms stressing their inconvenience and disadvantages such as that exposures were so long as eight hours that required a full days exposure during which time the sun had moved across the sky removing all trace of halftones or modelling in round objects and the photographic layer was apt to peel off in patches while praising the daguerreotype in glowing terms overlooking nicéphore niépces contribution in this way led niépces son isidore to resent his father being ignored as having been the first to capture the image produced in a camera by chemical means and isidore wrote a pamphlet in defence of his fathers reputation histoire de la decouverte improprement nommé daguerréotypehistory of the discovery improperly named the daguerreotype with a note on its real inventor joseph nicéphore niépce
daguerre was present but complained of a sore throat later that year william fox talbot announced his silver chloride sensitive paper process
together these announcements caused early commentators to choose the 1839 as the year photography was born or made public later it became known that niépces role had been downplayed in aragos efforts to publicize the daguerreotype and the first photograph is recorded in eders history of photography as having been taken in 1826 or 1827 niépces reputation as the real inventor of photography became known through his son isidores indignation that his fathers early experiments had been overlooked or ignored although nicéphore had revealed his process which at the time was secret
the phrase the birth of photography has been used by different authors to mean different things - either the publicizing of the process in 1839 as a metaphor to indicate that previous to that the daguerreotype process had been kept secret or the date the first photograph was taken by or with a camera using the asphalt process or heliography thought to have been 1822 but eders research indicates that the date was more probably 1826 or later and fox talbots first photographs had been made in the brilliant summer of 1835
daguerre and niépce had together signed an agreement in which remuneration for the invention would be paid for by subscription however the campaign they launched to finance the invention failed françois arago whose views on the system of patenting inventions can be gathered from speeches he made later in the house of deputies he apparently thought the english patent system had advantages over the french one did not think the idea of raising money by subscription to be a good one and supported daguerre by arranging for motions to be passed in both houses of the french parliament
daguerre did not patent and profit from his invention in the usual way instead it was arranged that the french government would acquire the rights in exchange for a lifetime pensions to daguerre and to niépces son and heir isidore the government would then present the daguerreotype process free to the world as a gift which it did on 19 august 1839 however five days previously to this miles berry a patent agent acting on daguerres behalf filed for patent no 8194 of 1839 a new or improved method of obtaining the spontaneous reproduction of all the images received in the focus of the camera obscura the patent applied to england wales and the town of berwick-upon-tweed and in all her majestys colonies and plantations abroad this was the usual wording of english patent specifications before 1852 it was only after the 1852 act which unified the patent systems of england ireland and scotland that a single patent protection was automatically extended to the whole of the british isles including the channel isles and the isle of man richard beard bought the patent rights from miles berry and also obtained a scottish patent which he apparently did not enforce the united kingdom and the colonies and plantations abroad therefore became the only places where a license was legally required to make and sell daguerreotypes
much of daguerres early work was destroyed when his home and studio caught fire on 8 march 1839 while the painter samuel morse was visiting from the us  malcolm daniel points out that fewer than twenty-five securely attributed photographs by daguerre survive—a mere handful of still lifes parisian views and portraits from the dawn of photography


 camera obscura 

the camera obscura latin for dark chamber in its simplest form is a naturally occurring phenomenon
a broad leaved tree in bright sunshine will provide conditions that fulfil the requirements of a pinhole camera or a camera obscura a bright light source the sun the shade that the leafy canopy provides and a flat surface onto which the image is projected and of course holes formed by the gaps between the leaves the suns image will show as a round disc and in a partial eclipse as a crescent
a clear description of a camera obscura is given by leonardo da vinci in codex atlanticus 1502 he called it oculus artificialis which means the artificial eye

if the facade of a building or a place or a landscape is illuminated by the sun and a small hole is drilled in the wall of a room in a building facing this which is not directly lighted by the sun then all objects illuminated by the sun will send their images through this aperture and will appear upside down on the wall facing the hole

in another notebook he wrote

you will catch these pictures on a piece of white paper which placed vertically in the room not far from that opening and you will see all the above-mentioned objects on this paper in their natural shapes or colors but they will appear smaller and upside down on account of crossing of the rays at that aperture if these pictures originate from a place which is illuminated by the sun they will appear colored on the paper exactly as they are the paper should be very thin and must be viewed from the back

in the 16th century daniele barbaro suggested replacing the small hole with a larger hole and an old mans spectacle lens a biconvex lens for correcting long-sightedness which produced a much brighter and sharper image
by the late 18th century small easily portable box-form units equipped with a simple lens an internal mirror and a ground glass screen had become popular among affluent amateurs for making sketches of landscapes and architecture the camera was pointed at the scene and steadied a sheet of thin paper was placed on top of the ground glass then a pencil or pen could be used to trace over the image projected from within the beautiful but fugitive little light-paintings on the screen inspired several people to seek some way of capturing them more completely and effectively—and automatically—by means of chemistry
daguerre a skilled professional artist was familiar with the camera obscura as an aid for establishing correct proportion and perspective sometimes very useful when planning out the celebrated theatrical scene backdrops he painted and the even larger ultra-realistic panoramas he exhibited in his popular diorama


 plate manufacture 
the daguerreotype image is formed on a highly polished silver surface usually the silver is a thin layer on a copper substrate but other metals such as brass can be used for the substrate and daguerreotypes can also be made on solid silver sheets a surface of very pure silver is preferable but sterling 92.5% pure or us coin 90% pure or even lower grades of silver are functional in 19th century practice the usual stock material sheffield plate was produced by a process sometimes called plating by fusion a sheet of sterling silver was heat-fused onto the top of a thick copper ingot when the ingot was repeatedly rolled under pressure to produce thin sheets the relative thicknesses of the two layers of metal remained constant the alternative was to electroplate a layer of pure silver onto a bare copper sheet the two technologies were sometimes combined the sheffield plate being given a finishing coat of pure silver by electroplating
in order that the corners of the plate would not tear the buffing material when the plate was polished the edges of the plate were bent back using patented devices that could also serve as plate holders to avoid touching the surface of the plate during processing


 the process 


 polishing 
to optimize the image quality of the end product the silver side of the plate had to be polished to as nearly perfect a mirror finish as possible the silver had to be completely free of tarnish or other contamination when it was sensitized so the daguerreotypist had to perform at least the final portion of the polishing and cleaning operation not too long before use in the 19th century the polishing was done with a buff covered with hide or velvet first using rotten stone then jewelers rouge then lampblack originally the work was entirely manual but buffing machinery was soon devised to assist finally the surface was swabbed with nitric acid to burn off any residual organic matter


 sensitization 
in darkness or by the light of a safelight the silver surface was exposed to halogen fumes originally only iodine fumes from iodine crystals at room temperature were used producing a surface coating of silver iodide but it was soon found that a subsequent exposure to bromine fumes greatly increased the sensitivity of the silver halide coating exposure to chlorine fumes or a combination of bromine and chlorine fumes could also be used a final re-fuming with iodine was typical


 exposure 
the plate was then carried to the camera in a light-tight plate holder withdrawing a protective dark slide or opening a pair of doors in the holder exposed the sensitized surface within the dark camera and removing a cap from the camera lens began the exposure creating an invisible latent image on the plate depending on the sensitization chemistry used the brightness of the lighting and the light-concentrating power of the lens the required exposure time ranged from a few seconds to many minutes after the exposure was judged to be complete the lens was capped and the holder was again made light-tight and removed from the camera


 development 
the latent image was developed to visibility by several minutes of exposure to the fumes given off by heated mercury in a purpose-made developing box the toxicity of mercury was well known in the 19th century but precautionary measures were rarely taken today however the hazards of contact with mercury and other chemicals traditionally used in the daguerreotype process are taken more seriously as is the risk of release of those chemicals into the environment
in the becquerel variation of the process published in 1840 but very seldom used in the 19th century the plate sensitized by fuming with iodine alone was developed by overall exposure to sunlight passing through yellow or red glass the silver iodide in its unexposed condition was insensitive to the red end of the visible spectrum of light and was unaffected but the latent image created in the camera by the blue violet and ultraviolet rays color-sensitized each point on the plate proportionally so that this color-filtered sunbath intensified it to full visibility as if the plate had been exposed in the camera for hours or days to produce a visible image without development


 fixing 
after development the light sensitivity of the plate was arrested by removing the remaining silver halide with a mild solution of sodium thiosulfate daguerres initial method was to use a hot saturated solution of common salt
gilding also called gold toning was an addition to daguerres process introduced by hippolyte fizeau in 1840 it soon became part of the standard procedure to give the steely gray image a slightly warmer tone and physically reinforce the powder-like silver particles of which it was composed a gold chloride solution was pooled onto the surface and the plate was briefly heated over a flame then drained rinsed and dried without this treatment the image was as delicate as the dust on a butterflys wing


 casing and other display options 

even when strengthened by gilding the image surface was still very easily marred and the silver was subject to tarnishing from exposure to the air so the finished plate was bound up with a protective cover glass and sealed with strips of paper soaked in gum arabic in the us and uk a gilt brass mat called a preserver in the us and a pinchbeck in britain was normally used to separate the image surface from the glass in continental europe a thin cardboard mat or passepartout usually served that purpose
there were two main methods of finishing daguerreotypes for protection and display
in the us and britain the tradition of preserving miniature paintings in a wooden case covered with leather or paper stamped with a relief pattern continued through to the daguerreotype some daguerreotypists were portrait artists who also offered miniature portraits black-lacquered cases ornamented with inset mother of pearl were sometimes used the more substantial union case was made from a mixture of colored sawdust and shellac the main component of wood varnish formed in a heated mold to produce a decorative sculptural relief the word union referred to the sawdust and varnish mixture—the manufacture of union cases began in 1856 in all types of cases the inside of the cover was lined with velvet or plush or satin to provide a dark surface to reflect into the plate for viewing and to protect the cover glass some cases however held two daguerreotypes opposite each other the cased images could be set out on a table or displayed on a mantelpiece most cases were small and lightweight enough to easily carry in a pocket although that was not normally done the other approach common in france and the rest of continental europe was to hang the daguerreotype on the wall in a frame either simple or elaborate
conservators were able to determine that a daguerreotype of walt whitman was made in new orleans with the main clue being the type of frame which was made for wall hanging in the french and continental style supporting evidence of the new orleans origin was a scrap of paper from le mesager a new orleans bilingual newspaper of the time which had been used to glue the plate into the frame other clues used by historians to identify daguerreotypes are hallmarks in the silver plate and the distinctive patterns left by different photographers when polishing the plate with a leather buff which leaves extremely fine parallel lines discernible on the surface
as the daguerreotype itself is on a relatively thin sheet of soft metal it was easily sheared down to sizes and shapes suited for mounting into lockets as was done with miniature paintings other imaginative uses of daguerreotype portraits were to mount them in watch fobs and watch cases jewel caskets and other ornate silver or gold boxes the handles of walking sticks and in brooches bracelets and other jewelry now referred to by collectors as daguerreian jewelry the cover glass or crystal was sealed either directly to the edges of the daguerreotype or to the opening of its receptacle and a protective hinged cover was usually provided


 unusual characteristics 

daguerreotypes are normally laterally reversed—mirror images—because they are necessarily viewed from the side that originally faced the camera lens although a daguerreotypist could attach a mirror or reflective prism in front of the lens to obtain a right-reading result in practice this was rarely done
the use of either type of attachment caused some light loss somewhat increasing the required exposure time and unless they were of very high optical quality they could degrade the quality of the image right-reading text or right-handed buttons on mens clothing in a daguerreotype may only be evidence that it is a copy of a typical wrong-reading original
the experience of viewing a daguerreotype is unlike that of viewing any other type of photograph the image does not sit on the surface of the plate after flipping from positive to negative as the viewing angle is adjusted viewers experience an apparition in space a mirage that arises once the eyes are properly focused of course when reproduced via other processes this effect associated with viewing an original daguerreotype will no longer be apparent other processes that have a similar viewing experience are holograms on credit cards or lippmann plates
although daguerreotypes are unique images they could be copied by re-daguerreotyping the original copies were also produced by lithography or engraving today they can be digitally scanned
a well-exposed and sharp large-format daguerreotype is able to faithfully record fine detail at a resolution that todays digital cameras are not able to match
as arago pointed out in his presentation of the process to the french chamber of deputies the expense of the silver may be offset by being able to wipe a plate clean and produce images again and again on the same plate


 reduction of exposure time 
in the early 1840s two innovations were introduced that dramatically shortened the required exposure times a lens that produced a much brighter image in the camera and a modification of the chemistry used to sensitize the plate
the very first daguerreotype cameras used chevalier lenses which were slow about f14 they projected a sharp and undistorted but dim image onto the plate such a lens was necessary in order to produce the highly detailed results which had elicited so much astonishment and praise when daguerreotypes were first exhibited results which the purchasers of daguerreotype equipment expected to achieve using this lens and the original sensitizing method an exposure of several minutes was required to photograph even a very brightly sunlit scene a much faster lens could have been provided—simply omitting the integral fixed diaphragm from the chevalier lens would have increased its working aperture to about f4.7 and reduced the exposure time by nearly 90 percent—but because of the existing state of lens design the much shorter exposure would have been at the cost of a peripherally distorted and very much less clear image with uncommon exceptions daguerreotypes made before 1841 were of immobile subjects such as landscapes public or historic buildings monuments statuary and still life arrangements attempts at portrait photography with the chevalier lens required the sitter to face into the sun for several minutes while trying to remain motionless and look pleasant usually producing repulsive and unflattering results
in 1841 the petzval portrait lens was introduced professor andreas von ettingshausen brought the need for a faster lens for daguerreotype cameras to his colleague professor petzvals attention who went ahead in cooperation with the voigtländer firm to design a lens that would reduce the time needed to expose daguerreotype plates for portraiture petzval was not aware of the scale of his invention at the start of his work on the lens and later regretted not having secured his rights by obtaining letters patent on his invention it was the first lens to be designed using mathematical computation and a team of mathematicians whose speciality was in fact calculating the trajectories of ballistics was put at petzvals disposal by the archduke ludvig it was scientifically designed and optimized for its purpose with a working aperture of about f3.6 an exposure only about one-fifteenth as long as that required when using a chevalier lens was sufficient although it produced an acceptably sharp image in the central area of the plate where the sitters face was likely to be the image quality dropped off toward the edges so for this and other reasons it was unsuitable for landscape photography and not a general replacement for chevalier-type lenses petzval intended his lens to be convertible with two alternative rear components one for portraiture and the other for landscape and architecture
the other major innovation was a chemical one in daguerres original process the plate was sensitized by exposure to iodine fumes alone a breakthrough came with the discovery that when exposure to bromine or chlorine fumes was correctly combined with this the sensitivity of the plate could be greatly increased which in turn greatly reduced the required exposure time to between fifteen and thirty seconds in favorable lighting conditions according to eder several experimenters discovered the propensity of using chlorine and bromine in addition to iodine wolcott whose wolcotts mixture was marketed by his partner john johnson that they called quickstuff two unrelated individuals with the surname goddard – philadelphia physician and chemist paul beck goddard and john frederick goddard who lectured at the adelaide gallery before assisting beard with setting up the first daguerreotype portraiture studio on the roof of the regent street polytechnic john frederick goddard was the first to publish information that bromine increased the sensitivity of daguerreotype plates in the literary gazette of 12 december 1840  and in vienna krachowila and the natterer brothers


 unusual daguerreotype cameras 
a number of innovative camera designs appeared
one early attempt to address the lack of a good fast lens for portraiture and the subject of the first us patent for photographic apparatus was alexander wolcotts camera which used a concave mirror instead of a lens and operated on the principle of the reflecting telescope the mirror was fitted at one end of the camera and focusing was done by adjusting the position of the plate in a holder that slid along a rail designed solely for portraiture this arrangement produced a far brighter image than a chevalier lens or even the later petzval lens but image quality was only marginal and the design was only practical for use with small plates
friedrich voigtländers small all-metal daguerrotype camera 1841 was small enough to be carried it was fitted with a f3.5 petzval portrait lens at the front and a focusing lens at the back and took round plates only 600 of these cameras were produced
the directions for the use of the voigtländer camera read as follows

directions for the use of the new daguerreotype apparatus for the making of portraits executed according to the calculations of professor petzval by voigtländer and son vienna printed by jpsollinger august 1 1841

the person to be photographed must be seated in the open air for an exposure by overcast dark skies in winter 3 ½ minutes is sufficient on a sunny day in the shade 1½ to 2 minutes are enough and in direct sunlight it requires no more than 40–45 seconds the last however is seldom employed on account of the deep shadows direct sunlight creates

the stated exposure times are evidently for plates sensitized with iodine only improved sensitization methods were just being introduced in 1841–42
in 1845 friedrich von martens invented the first panoramic camera for curved daguerreotype plates with a lens that turned to cover an angle of 150 degrees it was called megaskop-kamera of panorama-kamera
netto constructed in 1841 a studio in which the front part of the camera with the lens was built into the wall between the studio and the adjoining darkroom the rear part of the camera being inside the darkroom


 portraiture 
in one early attempt at portraiture a swedish amateur daguerreotypist caused his sitter nearly to lose an eye because of practically staring into the sun during the five-minute exposure

even with fast lenses and much more sensitive plates under portrait studio lighting conditions an exposure of several seconds was necessary on the brightest of days and on hazy or cloudy days the sitter had to remain still for considerably longer the head rest was already in use for portrait painting
establishments producing daguerreotype portraits generally had a daylight studio built on the roof much like a greenhouse whereas later in the history of photography artificial electric lighting was done in a dark room building up the light with hard spotlights and softer floodlights the daylight studio was equipped with screens and blinds to control the light to reduce it and make it unidirectional or diffuse it to soften harsh direct lighting blue filtration was sometimes used to make it easier for the sitter to tolerate the strong light as a daguerreotype plate was almost exclusively sensitive to light at the blue end of the spectrum and filtering out everything else did not significantly increase the exposure time
usually it was arranged so that sitters leaned their elbows on a support such as a posing table the height of which could be adjusted or else head rests were used that did not show in the picture and this led to most daguerreotype portraits having stiff lifeless poses some exceptions exist with lively expressions full of character as photographers saw the potential of the new medium and would have used the tableau vivant technique these are represented in museum collections and are the most sought after by private collectors today in the case of young children their mothers were sometimes hidden in the frame to calm them and keep them still so as to prevent blurring
the image in a daguerreotype is often described as being formed by the amalgam or alloy of mercury and silver because mercury vapor from a pool of heated mercury is used to develop the plate but using the becquerel process using a red filter and two-and-a-half stops extra exposure daguerreotypes can be produced without mercury and chemical analysis shows that there is no mercury in the final image with the becquerel process this brings into question the theory that the image is formed of amalgam with mercury development
although the daguerreotype process could only produce a single image at a time copies could be created by re-daguerreotyping the original although this proved difficult according to joseph maria eder as with any original photograph that is copied the contrast increases with a daguerreotype any writing will appear back to front recopying a daguerreotype will make the writing appear normal and rings worn on the fingers will appear on the correct hand another device to make a daguerreotype the right way round would be to use a mirror when taking the photograph
the daguerreotypes of the 1852 omaha indian native american delegation in the smithsonian include a daguerrotype copied in the camera recognizable by the contrast being high and a black line down the side of the plate


 proliferation 

andré-adolphe-eugène disdéri and jules itier of france and johann baptist isenring of switzerland became prominent daguerreotypists in britain however richard beard bought the british daguerreotype patent from miles berry in 1841 and closely controlled his investment selling licenses throughout the country and prosecuting infringers among others antoine claudet and thomas richard williams produced daguerreotypes in the uk
daguerreotype photography spread rapidly across the united states after the discovery first appeared in us newspapers in february 1839  in the early 1840s the invention was introduced in a period of months to practitioners in the united states by samuel morse inventor of the telegraph code
it is possible that morse may have been the first american to view a daguerreotype first-hand morses experience with art and technology in the early 1800s attracted him to the daguerreotype in the summers of 1820 and 1821 he conducted proto-photographic experiments with benjamin silliman in his piece the gallery of the louvre morse used a camera obscura to precisely capture the gallery which he then used to create the final painting
morse met the inventor of the daguerreotype louis-jacques-mande daguerre in paris in january 1839 when daguerres invention was announced 2 while the daguerreotype fascinated morse he was concerned about how the new invention would compete with his telegraph however morses viewing of the daguerreotype alleviated his fears when he saw how revolutionary its technology was morse wrote a letter to his brother sidney describing daguerres invention which sidney then published in the new-york observer on april 20 1839 while this was not the first report of the daguerreotype to appear in america it was the first in-person report to appear in the united states
morses account of the brand-new invention interested the american public and through further publishings the technique of the daguerreotype integrated into the united states magazines and newspapers included essays applauding the daguerreotype for advancing democratic american values because it could create an image without painting which was less efficient and more expensive the introduction of the daguerreotype to america also promoted progress of ideals and technology for example an article published in the boston daily advertiser on february 23 1839 described the daguerreotype as having similar properties of the camera obscura but introduced its remarkable capability of fixing the image permanently on the paper or making a permanent drawing by the agency of light alone which combined old and new concepts for readers to understand
by 1853 an estimated three million daguerreotypes per year were being produced in the united states alone one of these original morse daguerreotype cameras is currently on display at the national museum of american history a branch of the smithsonian institution in washington dc a flourishing market in portraiture sprang up predominantly the work of itinerant practitioners who traveled from town to town for the first time in history people could obtain an exact likeness of themselves or their loved ones for a modest cost making portrait photographs extremely popular with those of modest means celebrities and everyday people sought portraits and workers would save an entire days income to have a daguerreotype taken of them including occupational portraits
notable us daguerreotypists of the mid-19th century included james presley ball samuel bemis abraham bogardus mathew brady thomas martin easterly françois fleischbein jeremiah gurney john plumbe jr albert southworth augustus washington ezra greenleaf weld and john adams whipple
this method spread to other parts of the world as well
the first daguerreotype in australia was taken in 1841 but no longer survives the oldest surviving australian daguerreotype is a portrait of dr william bland taken in 1845
in jamaica adolphe duperly a frenchman produced a booklet of daguerreotypes daguerian excursions in jamaica being a collection of views  taken on the spot with the daguerreotype which probably appeared in 1844
in 1857 ichiki shirō created the first known japanese photograph a portrait of his daimyō shimazu nariakira the photograph was designated an important cultural property by the government of japan


 astronomical application in the 1870s 
in 1839 françois arago had in his address to the french chamber of deputies outlined a wealth of possible applications including astronomy and indeed the daguerreotype was still occasionally used for astronomical photography in the 1870s
although the collodion wet plate process offered a cheaper and more convenient alternative for commercial portraiture and for other applications with shorter exposure times when the transit of venus was about to occur and observations were to be made from several sites on the earths surface in order to calculate astronomical distances daguerreotypy proved a more accurate method of making visual recordings through telescopes because it was a dry process with greater dimensional stability whereas collodion glass plates were exposed wet and the image would become slightly distorted when the emulsion dried


 late and modern use 
although the daguerreotype process is sometimes said to have died out completely in the early 1860s documentary evidence indicates that some very slight use of it persisted more or less continuously throughout the following 150 years of its supposed extinction a few first-generation daguerreotypists refused to entirely abandon their old medium when they started making the new cheaper easier to view but comparatively drab ambrotypes and tintypes historically minded photographers of subsequent generations often fascinated by daguerreotypes sometimes experimented with making their own or even revived the process commercially as a retro portraiture option for their clients these eccentric late uses were extremely unusual and surviving examples reliably dated to between the 1860s and the 1960s are now exceedingly rare
the daguerreotype experienced a minor renaissance in the late 20th century and the process is currently practiced by a handful of enthusiastic devotees there are thought to be fewer than 100 worldwide see list of artists on cdagsorg in links below in recent years artists like jerry spagnoli adam fuss patrick bailly-maître-grand alyssa c salomon and chuck close have reintroduced the medium to the broader art world the use of electronic flash in modern daguerreotypy has solved many of the problems connected with the slow speed of the process when using daylight
international group exhibitions of contemporary daguerreotypists works have been held notably the 2009 exhibition in bry sur marne france with 182 daguerreotypes by forty-four artists and the 2013 imageobject exhibition in new york city showcasing seventy-five works by thirty-three artists the astolat dollhouse castle also displays daguerreotypes the appeal of the medium lies in the magic mirror effect of light striking the polished silver plate and revealing a silvery image which can seem ghostly and ethereal even while being perfectly sharp and in the dedication and handcrafting required to make a daguerreotype
