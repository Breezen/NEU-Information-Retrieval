the apollo program also known as project apollo was the third united states human spaceflight program carried out by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa which accomplished landing the first humans on the moon from 1969 to 1972 first conceived during dwight d eisenhowers administration as a three-man spacecraft to follow the one-man project mercury which put the first americans in space apollo was later dedicated to president john f kennedys national goal of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth by the end of the 1960s which he proposed in an address to congress on may 25 1961
kennedys goal was accomplished on the apollo 11 mission when astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin landed their lunar module lm on july 20 1969 and walked on the lunar surface while michael collins remained in lunar orbit in the commandservice module csm and all three landed safely on earth on july 24 five subsequent apollo missions also landed astronauts on the moon the last in december 1972 in these six spaceflights twelve men walked on the moon

apollo ran from 1961 to 1972 with the first manned flight in 1968 it achieved its goal of manned lunar landing despite the major setback of a 1967 apollo 1 cabin fire that killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test after the first landing sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunar geological and astrophysical exploration budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings but the apollo 13 landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the moon which destroyed the service modules capability to provide electrical power crippling the csms propulsion and life support systems the crew returned to earth safely by using the lunar module as a lifeboat for these functions apollo used saturn family rockets as launch vehicles which were also used for an apollo applications program which consisted of skylab a space station that supported three manned missions in 1973–74 and the apollo–soyuz test project a joint us-soviet union earth-orbit mission in 1975
apollo set several major human spaceflight milestones it stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low earth orbit apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body while the final apollo 17 mission marked the sixth moon landing and the ninth manned mission beyond low earth orbit the program returned 842 pounds 382 kg of lunar rocks and soil to earth greatly contributing to the understanding of the moons composition and geological history the program laid the foundation for nasas subsequent human spaceflight capability and funded construction of its johnson space center and kennedy space center apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and manned spaceflight including avionics telecommunications and computers


 background 
the apollo program was conceived during the eisenhower administration in early 1960 as a follow-up to project mercury while the mercury capsule could only support one astronaut on a limited earth orbital mission apollo would carry three astronauts possible missions included ferrying crews to a space station circumlunar flights and eventual manned lunar landings the program was named after the greek god of light music and the sun by nasa manager abe silverstein who later said that i was naming the spacecraft like id name my baby silverstein chose the name at home one evening early in 1960 because he felt apollo riding his chariot across the sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program


 spacecraft feasibility studies 

in july 1960 nasa deputy administrator hugh l dryden announced the apollo program to industry representatives at a series of space task group conferences preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with a mission module cabin separate from the command module piloting and re-entry cabin and a propulsion and equipment module on august 30 a feasibility study competition was announced and on october 25 three study contracts were awarded to general dynamicsconvair general electric and the glenn l martin company meanwhile nasa performed its own in-house spacecraft design studies led by maxime faget to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs


 political pressure builds 

in november 1960 john f kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised american superiority over the soviet union in the fields of space exploration and missile defense up to the election of 1960 kennedy had been speaking out against the missile gap that he and many other senators felt had formed between the soviets and themselves due to the inaction of president eisenhower beyond military power kennedy used aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige pledging to make the us not first but first and first if but first period despite kennedys rhetoric he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the apollo program once he became president he knew little about the technical details of the space program and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a manned moon landing when kennedys newly appointed nasa administrator james e webb requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency kennedy supported an acceleration of nasas large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue
on april 12 1961 soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person to fly in space reinforcing american fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the soviet union at a meeting of the us house committee on science and astronautics one day after gagarins flight many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that america would catch up kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news refusing to make a commitment on americas response to the soviets

on april 20 kennedy sent a memo to vice president lyndon b johnson asking johnson to look into the status of americas space program and into programs that could offer nasa the opportunity to catch up johnson responded approximately one week later concluding that we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership his memo concluded that a manned moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the united states would achieve it first
on may 25 1961 twenty days after the first us manned spaceflight freedom 7 kennedy proposed the manned moon landing in a special message to the congress on urgent national needs

now it is time to take longer strides - time for a great new american enterprise - time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement which in many ways may hold the key to our future on earth
i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind or more important in the long-range exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish full text 


 nasa expansion 
at the time of kennedys proposal only one american had flown in space—less than a month earlier—and nasa had not yet sent an astronaut into orbit even some nasa employees doubted whether kennedys ambitious goal could be met by 1963 kennedy even came close to agreeing to a joint us-ussr moon mission to eliminate duplication of effort
with the clear goal of a manned landing replacing the more nebulous goals of space stations and circumlunar flights nasa decided that in order to make progress quickly it would discard the feasibility study designs of convair ge and martin and proceed with fagets command  service module design the mission module was determined to be only useful as an extra room and therefore deemed unnecessary they used fagets design as the specification for another competition for spacecraft procurement bids in october 1961 on november 28 1961 it was announced that north american aviation had won the contract although its bid was not rated as good as martins webb dryden and robert seamans chose it in preference due to north americans longer association with nasa and its predecessor
landing men on the moon by the end of 1969 required the most sudden burst of technological creativity and the largest commitment of resources 25 billion 107 billion in 2016 dollars ever made by any nation in peacetime at its peak the apollo program employed 400,000 people and required the support of over 20,000 industrial firms and universities
on july 1 1960 nasa established the marshall space flight center msfc in huntsville alabama msfc designed the heavy lift-class saturn launch vehicles which would be required for apollo


 manned spacecraft center 

it became clear that managing the apollo program would exceed the capabilities of robert r gilruths space task group which had been directing the nations manned space program from nasas langley research center so gilruth was given authority to grow his organization into a new nasa center the manned spacecraft center msc a site was chosen in houston texas on land donated by rice university and administrator webb announced the conversion on september 19 1961 it was also clear nasa would soon outgrow its practice of controlling missions from its cape canaveral air force station launch facilities in florida so a new mission control center would be included in the msc

in september 1962 by which time two project mercury astronauts had orbited the earth gilruth had moved his organization to rented space in houston and construction of the msc facility was under way kennedy visited rice to reiterate his challenge in a famous speech

but why some say the moon why choose this as our goal and they may well ask why climb the highest mountain why 35 years ago fly the atlantic 
we choose to go to the moon we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept one we are unwilling to postpone and one we intend to win   full text 

the msc was completed in september 1963 it was renamed by the us congress in honor of lyndon johnson soon after his death in 1973


 launch operations center 

it also became clear that apollo would outgrow the canaveral launch facilities in florida the two newest launch complexes were already being built for the saturn i and ib rockets at the northernmost end lc-34 and lc-37 but an even bigger facility would be needed for the mammoth rocket required for the manned lunar mission so land acquisition was started in july 1961 for a launch operations center loc immediately north of canaveral at merritt island the design development and construction of the center was conducted by kurt h debus a member of dr wernher von brauns original v-2 rocket engineering team debus was named the locs first director construction began in november 1962 upon kennedys death president johnson issued an executive order on november 29 1963 to rename the loc and cape canaveral in honor of kennedy
the loc included launch complex 39 a launch control center and a 130 million cubic foot 3.7 million cubic meter vertical assembly building vab in which the space vehicle launch vehicle and spacecraft would be assembled on a mobile launcher platform and then moved by a transporter to one of several launch pads although at least three pads were planned only two designated a and b were completed in october 1965 the loc also included an operations and checkout building ocb to which gemini and apollo spacecraft were initially received prior to being mated to their launch vehicles the apollo spacecraft could be tested in two vacuum chambers capable of simulating atmospheric pressure at altitudes up to 250,000 feet 76 km which is nearly a vacuum


 organization 
administrator webb realized that in order to keep apollo costs under control he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization so he recruited dr george e mueller for a high management job mueller accepted on the condition that he have a say in nasa reorganization necessary to effectively administer apollo webb then worked with associate administrator later deputy administrator seamans to reorganize the office of manned space flight omsf on july 23 1963 webb announced muellers appointment as deputy associate administrator for manned space flight to replace then associate administrator d brainerd holmes on his retirement effective september 1 under webbs reorganization the directors of the manned spacecraft center gilruth marshall space flight center von braun and the launch operations center debus effectively reported to mueller
based on his industry experience on air force missile projects mueller realized some skilled managers could be found among high-ranking officers in the united states air force so he got webbs permission to recruit general samuel c phillips who gained a reputation for his effective management of the minuteman program as omsf program controller phillips superior officer bernard a schriever agreed to loan phillips to nasa along with a staff of officers under him on the condition that phillips be made apollo program director mueller agreed and phillips managed apollo from january 1964 until it achieved the first manned landing in july 1969 after which he returned to air force duty


 choosing a mission mode 

once kennedy had defined a goal the apollo mission planners were faced with the challenge of designing a spacecraft that could meet it while minimizing risk to human life cost and demands on technology and astronaut skill four possible mission modes were considered
direct ascent the spacecraft would be launched as a unit and travel directly to the moon and land it would return leaving its landing stage on the moon this design would have required development of the extremely powerful nova launch vehicle
earth orbit rendezvous eor multiple rocket launches up to 15 in some plans would carry parts of a direct ascent spacecraft and propulsion units for translunar injection tli these would be assembled into a single spacecraft in earth orbit
lunar orbit rendezvous lor a single saturn v could launch a spacecraft that was composed of a mother ship which would remain in orbit around the moon while a smaller two-stage lander would carry two astronauts to the surface return to dock with the mother ship and then be discarded landing only a small part of the spacecraft on the moon and returning an even smaller part to lunar orbit minimized the total mass to be launched from the earth
lunar surface rendezvous two spacecraft would be launched in succession the first an automated vehicle carrying propellant for the return to earth would land on the moon to be followed some time later by the manned vehicle propellant would have to be transferred from the automated vehicle to the manned vehicle

in early 1961 direct ascent was generally the mission mode in favor at nasa many engineers feared that a rendezvous—let alone a docking—neither of which had been attempted even in earth orbit would be extremely difficult in lunar orbit dissenters including john houbolt at langley research center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the lor approach throughout 1960 and 1961 houbolt campaigned for the recognition of lor as a viable and practical option bypassing the nasa hierarchy he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to associate administrator robert seamans while acknowledging that he spoke somewhat as a voice in the wilderness houbolt pleaded that lor should not be discounted in studies of the question
 seamans establishment of an ad-hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant nicholas e golovin in july 1961 to recommend a launch vehicle to be used in the apollo program represented a turning point in nasas mission mode decision this committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice and recommended in favor of a hybrid eor-lor mode its consideration of lor—as well as houbolts ceaseless work—played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach in late 1961 and early 1962 members of the manned spacecraft center began to come around to support lor including the newly hired deputy director of the office of manned space flight joseph shea who became a champion of lor the engineers at marshall space flight center msfc which had much to lose from the decision took longer to become convinced of its merits but their conversion was announced by wernher von braun at a briefing on june 7 1962
but even after nasa reached internal agreement it was far from smooth sailing kennedys science advisor jerome wiesner who had expressed his opposition to manned spaceflight to kennedy before the president took office and had opposed the decision to land men on the moon hired golovin who had left nasa to chair his own space vehicle panel ostensibly to monitor but actually to second-guess nasas decisions on the saturn v launch vehicle and lor by forcing shea seamans and even webb to defend themselves delaying its formal announcement to the press on july 11 1962 and forcing webb to still hedge the decision as tentative
wiesner kept up the pressure even making the disagreement public during a two-day september visit by the president to marshall space flight center wiesner blurted out no thats no good in front of the press during a presentation by von braun webb jumped in and defended von braun until kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was still subject to final review webb held firm and issued a request for proposal to candidate lunar excursion module lem contractors wiesner finally relented unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in kennedys office because of the presidents involvement with the october cuban missile crisis and fear of kennedys support for webb nasa announced the selection of grumman as the lem contractor in november 1962
space historian james hansen concludes that

without nasas adoption of this stubbornly held minority opinion in 1962 the united states may still have reached the moon but almost certainly it would not have been accomplished by the end of the 1960s president kennedys target date

the lor method had the advantage of allowing the lander spacecraft to be used as a lifeboat in the event of a failure of the command ship some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen a 1964 msc study concluded the lm as lifeboat  was finally dropped because no single reasonable csm failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the sps ironically just such a failure happened on apollo 13 when an oxygen tank explosion left the csm without electrical power the lunar module provided propulsion electrical power and life support to get the crew home safely


 spacecraft 

fagets preliminary apollo design employed a cone-shaped command module supported by one of several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power sized appropriately for the space station cislunar and lunar landing missions once kennedys moon landing goal became official detailed design began of a commandservice module csm in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module the final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the csms role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew along with a new spacecraft the lunar excursion module lem later shortened to lunar module lm which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the csm


 commandservice module 

the command module cm was the conical crew cabin designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an earth ocean landing it was the only component of the apollo spacecraft to survive without major configuration changes as the program evolved from the early apollo study designs its exterior was covered with an ablative heat shield and had its own reaction control system rcs engines to control its attitude and steer its atmospheric entry path parachutes were carried to slow its descent to splashdown the module was 11.42 feet 3.48 m tall 12.83 feet 3.91 m in diameter and weighed approximately 12,250 pounds 5,560 kg
a cylindrical service module sm supported the command module with a service propulsion engine and an rcs with propellants and a fuel cell power generation system with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen reactants a high-gain s-band antenna was used for long-distance communications on the lunar flights on the extended lunar missions an orbital scientific instrument package was carried the service module was discarded just before re-entry the module was 24.6 feet 7.5 m long and 12.83 feet 3.91 m in diameter the initial lunar flight version weighed approximately 51,300 pounds 23,300 kg fully fueled while a later version designed to carry a lunar orbit scientific instrument package weighed just over 54,000 pounds 24,000 kg
north american aviation won the contract to build the csm and also the second stage of the saturn v launch vehicle for nasa because the csm design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the csm off the moon and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight also there was no provision for docking with the lunar module a 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as block i which would be used for early testing while block ii the actual lunar spacecraft would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in block i development


 lunar module 

the lunar module lm was designed to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the command module not designed to fly through the earths atmosphere or return to earth its fuselage was designed totally without aerodynamic considerations and was of an extremely lightweight construction it consisted of separate descent and ascent stages each with its own engine the descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant surface stay consumables and surface exploration equipment the ascent stage contained the crew cabin ascent propellant and a reaction control system the initial lm model weighed approximately 33,300 pounds 15,100 kg and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours an extended lunar module weighed over 36,200 pounds 16,400 kg and allowed surface stays of over 3 days the contract for design and construction of the lunar module was awarded to grumman aircraft engineering corporation and the project was overseen by thomas j kelly


 launch vehicles 

before the apollo program began wernher von braun and his team of rocket engineers had started work on plans for very large launch vehicles the saturn series and the even larger nova series in the midst of these plans von braun was transferred from the army to nasa and made director of the marshall space flight center the initial direct ascent plan to send the three-man apollo commandservice module directly to the lunar surface on top of a large descent rocket stage would require a nova-class launcher with a lunar payload capability of over 180,000 pounds 82,000 kg the june 11 1962 decision to use lunar orbit rendezvous enabled the saturn v to replace the nova and the msfc proceeded to develop the saturn rocket family for apollo


 little joe ii 

since apollo like mercury would require a launch escape system les in case of a launch failure a relatively small rocket was required for qualification flight testing of this system a size bigger than the naa little joe would be required so the little joe ii was built by general dynamicsconvair after an august 1963 qualification test flight four les test flights a-001 through 004 were made at the white sands missile range between may 1964 and january 1966


 saturn i 

since apollo like mercury used more than one launch vehicle for space missions nasa used spacecraft-launch vehicle combination series numbers as-10x for saturn i as-20x for saturn ib and as-50x for saturn v compare mercury-redstone 3 mercury-atlas 6 to designate and plan all missions rather than numbering them sequentially as in project gemini this was changed by the time manned flights began
saturn i the first us heavy lift launch vehicle was initially planned to launch partially equipped csms in low earth orbit tests the s-i first stage burned rp-1 with liquid oxygen lox oxidizer in eight clustered rocketdyne h-1 engines to produce 1,500,000 pounds-force 6,670 kn of thrust the s-iv second stage used six liquid hydrogen-fueled pratt  whitney rl-10 engines with 90,000 pounds-force 400 kn of thrust a planned centaur s-v third stage with two rl-10 engines never flew on saturn i
the first four saturn i test flights were launched from lc-34 with only live first stages carrying dummy upper stages filled with water the first flight with a live s-iv was launched from lc-37 this was followed by five launches of boilerplate csms designated as-101 through as-105 into orbit in 1964 and 1965 the last three of these further supported the apollo program by also carrying pegasus satellites which verified the safety of the translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity of micrometeorite impacts
in september 1962 nasa planned to launch four manned csm flights on the saturn i from late 1965 through 1966 concurrent with project gemini the 22,500-pound 10,200 kg payload capacity would have severely limited the systems which could be included so the decision was made in october 1963 to use the uprated saturn ib for all manned earth orbital flights


 saturn ib 

the saturn ib was an upgraded version of the saturn i the s-ib first stage increased the thrust to 1,600,000 pounds-force 7,120 kn by uprating the h-1 engine the second stage replaced the s-iv with the s-ivb-200 powered by a single j-2 engine burning liquid hydrogen fuel with lox to produce 200,000 pounds-force 890 kn of thrust a restartable version of the s-ivb was used as the third stage of the saturn v the saturn ib could send over 40,000 pounds 18,100 kg into low earth orbit sufficient for a partially fueled csm or the lm saturn ib launch vehicles and flights were designated with an as-200 series number as indicating apollo saturn and the 2 indicating the second member of the saturn rocket family


 saturn v 

saturn v launch vehicles and flights were designated with an as-500 series number as indicating apollo saturn and the 5 indicating saturn v the three-stage saturn v was designed to send a fully fueled csm and lm to the moon it was 33 feet 10.1 m in diameter and stood 363 feet 110.6 m tall with its 96,800-pound 43,900 kg lunar payload its capability grew to 103,600 pounds 47,000 kg for the later advanced lunar landings the s-ic first stage burned rp-1lox for a rated thrust of 7,500,000 pounds-force 33,400 kn which was upgraded to 7,610,000 pounds-force 33,900 kn the second and third stages burned liquid hydrogen and the third stage was a modified version of the s-ivb with thrust increased to 230,000 pounds-force 1,020 kn and capability to restart the engine for translunar injection after reaching a parking orbit


 astronauts 

nasas director of flight crew operations during the apollo program was donald k deke slayton one of the original mercury seven astronauts who was medically grounded in september 1962 due to a heart murmur slayton was responsible for making all gemini and apollo crew assignments

thirty-two astronauts were assigned to fly missions in the apollo program twenty-four of these left earths orbit and flew around the moon between december 1968 and december 1972 three of them twice half of the 24 walked on the moons surface though none of them returned to it after landing once one of the moonwalkers was a trained geologist of the 32 gus grissom ed white and roger chaffee were killed during a ground test in preparation for the apollo 1 mission
the apollo astronauts were chosen from the project mercury and gemini veterans plus from two later astronaut groups all missions were commanded by gemini or mercury veterans crews on all development flights except the earth orbit csm development flights through the first two landings on apollo 11 and apollo 12 included at least two sometimes three gemini veterans dr harrison schmitt a geologist was the first nasa scientist astronaut to fly in space and landed on the moon on the last mission apollo 17 schmitt participated in the lunar geology training of all of the apollo landing crews
nasa awarded all 32 of these astronauts its highest honor the distinguished service medal given for distinguished service ability or courage and personal contribution representing substantial progress to the nasa mission the medals were awarded posthumously to grissom white and chaffee in 1969 then to the crews of all missions from apollo 8 onward the crew that flew the first earth orbital test mission apollo 7 walter m schirra donn eisele and walter cunningham were awarded the lesser nasa exceptional service medal because of discipline problems with the flight directors orders during their flight the nasa administrator in october 2008 decided to award them the distinguished service medals by this time posthumously to schirra and eisele


 lunar mission profile 
the nominal planned lunar landing mission proceeded as follows


 profile variations 
starting with apollo 13 descent orbit insertion was to be performed using the service module engine instead of the lm engine in order to allow a greater fuel reserve for landing this was actually done for the first time on apollo 14 since the apollo 13 mission was aborted before landing
the first three lunar missions apollo 8 apollo 10 and apollo 11 used a free return trajectory keeping a flight path coplanar with the lunar orbit which would allow a return to earth in case the sm engine failed to make lunar orbit insertion landing site lighting conditions on later missions dictated a lunar orbital plane change which required a course change maneuver soon after tli and eliminated the free-return option
after apollo 12 placed the second of several seismometers on the moon the s-ivbs on subsequent missions were deliberately crashed on the moon instead of being sent to solar orbit as an active seismic experiment to induce vibrations in the moon
as another active seismic experiment the jettisoned lm ascent stages on apollo 12 and later missions were deliberately crashed on the moon at known locations the only exceptions to this were the apollo 13 lm which burned up in the earths atmosphere and apollo 16 where a loss of attitude control after jettison prevented making a targeted impact


 development history 


 unmanned flight tests 

two block i csms were launched from lc-34 on suborbital flights in 1966 with the saturn ib the first as-201 launched on february 26 reached an altitude of 265.7 nautical miles 492.1 km and splashed down 4,577 nautical miles 8,477 km downrange in the atlantic ocean the second as-202 on august 25 reached 617.1 nautical miles 1,142.9 km altitude and was recovered 13,900 nautical miles 25,700 km downrange in the pacific ocean these flights validated the service module engine and the command module heat shield
a third saturn ib test as-203 launched from pad 37 went into orbit to support design of the s-ivb upper stage restart capability needed for the saturn v it carried a nosecone instead of the apollo spacecraft and its payload was the unburned liquid hydrogen fuel the behavior of which engineers measured with temperature and pressure sensors and a tv camera this flight occurred on july 5 before as-202 which was delayed because of problems getting the apollo spacecraft ready for flight


 preparation for manned flight 
two manned orbital block i csm missions were planned as-204 and as-205 the block i crew positions were titled command pilot senior pilot and pilot the senior pilot would assume navigation duties while the pilot would function as a systems engineer the astronauts would wear a modified version of the gemini spacesuit
after an unmanned lm test flight as-206 a crew would fly the first block ii csm and lm in a dual mission known as as-207/208 or as-278 each spacecraft would be launched on a separate saturn ib the block ii crew positions were titled commander cdr command module pilot cmp and lunar module pilot lmp the astronauts would begin wearing a new apollo a6l spacesuit designed to accommodate lunar extravehicular activity eva the traditional visor helmet was replaced with a clear fishbowl type for greater visibility and the lunar surface eva suit would include a water-cooled undergarment
deke slayton the grounded mercury astronaut who became director of flight crew operations for the gemini and apollo programs selected the first apollo crew in january 1966 with grissom as command pilot white as senior pilot and rookie donn f eisele as pilot but eisele dislocated his shoulder twice aboard the kc135 weightlessness training aircraft and had to undergo surgery on january 27 slayton replaced him with chaffee nasa announced the final crew selection for as-204 on march 21 1966 with the backup crew consisting of gemini veterans james mcdivitt and david scott with rookie russell l rusty schweickart mercurygemini veteran wally schirra eisele and rookie walter cunningham were announced on september 29 as the prime crew for as-205
in december 1966 the as-205 mission was canceled since the validation of the csm would be accomplished on the 14-day first flight and as-205 would have been devoted to space experiments and contribute no new engineering knowledge about the spacecraft its saturn ib was allocated to the dual mission now redesignated as-205/208 or as-258 planned for august 1967 mcdivitt scott and schweickart were promoted to the prime as-258 crew and schirra eisele and cunningham were reassigned as the apollo 1 backup crew


 program delays 
the spacecraft for the as-202 and as-204 missions were delivered by north american aviation to the kennedy space center with long lists of equipment problems which had to be corrected before flight these delays caused the launch of as-202 to slip behind as-203 and eliminated hopes the first manned mission might be ready to launch as soon as november 1966 concurrently with the last gemini mission eventually the planned as-204 flight date was pushed to february 21 1967
north american aviation was prime contractor not only for the apollo csm but for the saturn v s-ii second stage as well and delays in this stage pushed the first unmanned saturn v flight as-501 from late 1966 to november 1967 the initial assembly of as-501 had to use a dummy spacer spool in place of the stage
the problems with north american were severe enough in late 1965 to cause manned space flight administrator george mueller to appoint program director samuel phillips to head a tiger team to investigate north americans problems and identify corrections phillips documented his findings in a december 19 letter to naa president lee atwood with a strongly worded letter by mueller and also gave a presentation of the results to mueller and deputy administrator robert seamans meanwhile grumman was also encountering problems with the lunar module eliminating hopes it would be ready for manned flight in 1967 not long after the first manned csm flights


 apollo 1 fire 

grissom white and chaffee decided to name their flight apollo 1 as a motivational focus on the first manned flight they trained and conducted tests of their spacecraft at north american and in the altitude chamber at the kennedy space center a plugs-out test was planned for january which would simulate a launch countdown on lc-34 with the spacecraft transferring from pad-supplied to internal power if successful this would be followed by a more rigorous countdown simulation test closer to the february 21 launch with both spacecraft and launch vehicle fueled
the plugs-out test began on the morning of january 27 1967 and immediately was plagued with problems first the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits which delayed the sealing of the hatch then communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown during this hold an electrical fire began in the cabin and spread quickly in the high pressure 100% oxygen atmosphere pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin inner wall burst allowing the fire to erupt onto the pad area and frustrating attempts to rescue the crew the astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened
nasa immediately convened an accident review board overseen by both houses of congress while the determination of responsibility for the accident was complex the review board concluded that deficiencies existed in command module design workmanship and quality control at the insistence of nasa administrator webb north american removed harrison storms as command module program manager webb also reassigned apollo spacecraft program office aspo manager joseph francis shea replacing him with george low

to remedy the causes of the fire changes were made in the block ii spacecraft and operational procedures the most important of which were use of a nitrogenoxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials the block ii design already called for replacement of the block i plug-type hatch cover with a quick-release outward opening door nasa discontinued the manned block i program using the block i spacecraft only for unmanned saturn v flights crew members would also exclusively wear modified fire-resistant a7l block ii space suits and would be designated by the block ii titles regardless of whether a lm was present on the flight or not


 unmanned saturn v and lm tests 
on april 24 1967 mueller published an official apollo mission numbering scheme using sequential numbers for all flights manned or unmanned the sequence would start with apollo 4 to cover the first three unmanned flights while retiring the apollo 1 designation to honor the crew per their widows wishes
in september 1967 mueller approved a sequence of mission types which had to be successfully accomplished in order to achieve the manned lunar landing each step had to be successfully accomplished before the next ones could be performed and it was unknown how many tries of each mission would be necessary therefore letters were used instead of numbers the a missions were unmanned saturn v validation b was unmanned lm validation using the saturn ib c was manned csm earth orbit validation using the saturn ib d was the first manned csmlm flight this replaced as-258 using a single saturn v launch e would be a higher earth orbit csmlm flight f would be the first lunar mission testing the lm in lunar orbit but without landing a dress rehearsal and g would be the first manned landing the list of types covered follow-on lunar exploration to include h lunar landings i for lunar orbital survey missions and j for extended-stay lunar landings
the delay in the csm caused by the fire enabled nasa to catch up on man-rating the lm and saturn v apollo 4 as-501 was the first unmanned flight of the saturn v carrying a block i csm on november 9 1967 the capability of the command modules heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the service module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual earth-orbital reentry speed
apollo 5 as-204 was the first unmanned test flight of lm in earth orbit launched from pad 37 on january 22 1968 by the saturn ib that would have been used for apollo 1 the lm engines were successfully test-fired and restarted despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing the ascent engine was fired in abort mode known as a fire-in-the-hole test where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage although grumman wanted a second unmanned test george low decided the next lm flight would be manned
this was followed on april 4 1968 by apollo 6 as-502 which carried a csm and a lm test article as ballast the intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort using the service module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry the saturn v experienced pogo oscillation a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages two s-ii engines shut down prematurely but the remaining engines were able to compensate the damage to the third stage engine was more severe preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection mission controllers were able to use the service module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of apollo 4 based on the good performance of apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the apollo 6 problems nasa declared the saturn v ready to fly men cancelling a third unmanned test


 manned development missions 

apollo 7 launched from lc-34 on october 11 1968 was the c mission crewed by schirra eisele and cunningham it was an 11-day earth-orbital flight which tested the csm systems
apollo 8 was planned to be the d mission in december 1968 crewed by mcdivitt scott and schweickart launched on a saturn v instead of two saturn ibs in the summer it had become clear that the lm would not be ready in time rather than waste the saturn v on another simple earth-orbiting mission aspo manager george low suggested the bold step of sending apollo 8 to orbit the moon instead deferring the d mission to the next mission in march 1969 and eliminating the e mission this would keep the program on track the soviet union had sent two tortoises mealworms wine flies and other lifeforms around the moon on september 15 1968 aboard zond 5 and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts the decision was not announced publicly until successful completion of apollo 7 gemini veterans frank borman and jim lovell and rookie william anders captured the worlds attention by making ten lunar orbits in 20 hours transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface on christmas eve and returning safely to earth
the following march lm flight rendezvous and docking were successfully demonstrated in earth orbit on apollo 9 and schweickart tested the full lunar eva suit with its portable life support system plss outside the lm the f mission was successfully carried out on apollo 10 in may 1969 by gemini veterans thomas p stafford john young and eugene cernan stafford and cernan took the lm to within 50,000 feet 15 km of the lunar surface

the g mission was achieved on apollo 11 in july 1969 by an all-gemini veteran crew consisting of neil armstrong michael collins and buzz aldrin armstrong and aldrin performed the first landing at the sea of tranquility at 201740 utc on july 20 1969 they spent a total of 21 hours 36 minutes on the surface and spent 2 hours 31 minutes outside the spacecraft walking on the surface taking photographs collecting material samples and deploying automated scientific instruments while continuously sending black-and-white television back to earth the astronauts returned safely on july 24

thats one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind


 production lunar landings 

in november 1969 gemini veteran charles pete conrad and rookie alan l bean made a precision landing on apollo 12 within walking distance of the surveyor 3 unmanned lunar probe which had landed in april 1967 on the ocean of storms the command module pilot was gemini veteran richard f gordon jr conrad and bean carried the first lunar surface color television camera but it was damaged when accidentally pointed into the sun they made two evas totaling 7 hours and 45 minutes on one they walked to the surveyor photographed it and removed some parts which they returned to earth
the success of the first two landings allowed the remaining missions to be crewed with a single veteran as commander with two rookies apollo 13 launched lovell jack swigert and fred haise in april 1970 headed for the fra mauro formation but two days out a liquid oxygen tank exploded disabling the service module and forcing the crew to use the lm as a life boat to return to earth another nasa review board was convened to determine the cause which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications apollo was grounded again for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added
the contracted batch of 15 saturn vs were enough for lunar landing missions through apollo 20 nasa publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites with plans to increase the mass of the csm and lm for the last five missions along with the payload capacity of the saturn v these final missions would combine the i and j types in the 1967 list allowing the cmp to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface and allowing them to stay on the moon for over three days these missions would also carry the lunar roving vehicle lrv increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the lm also the block ii spacesuit was revised for the extended missions to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the lrv


 mission cutbacks 

about the time of the first landing in 1969 it was decided to use an existing saturn v to launch the skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several saturn ib launches this eliminated apollo 20 nasas yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing and nasa also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming space shuttle by 1971 the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19 the two unused saturn vs became museum exhibits at the john f kennedy space center on merritt island florida george c marshall space center in huntsville alabama michoud assembly facility in new orleans louisiana and lyndon b johnson space center in houston texas
the cutbacks forced mission planners to reassess the original planned landing sites in order to achieve the most effective geological sample and data collection from the remaining four missions apollo 15 had been planned to be the last of the h series missions but since there would be only two subsequent missions left it was changed to the first of three j missions
apollo 13s fra mauro mission was reassigned to apollo 14 commanded in february 1971 by mercury veteran alan shepard with stuart roosa and edgar mitchell this time the mission was successful shepard and mitchell spent 33 hours and 31 minutes on the surface and completed two evas totalling 9 hours 24 minutes which was a record for the longest eva by a lunar crew at the time
in august 1971 just after conclusion of the apollo 15 mission president richard nixon proposed canceling the two remaining lunar landing missions apollo 16 and 17 office of management and budget deputy director caspar weinberger was opposed to this and persuaded nixon to keep the remaining missions


 extended missions 

apollo 15 was launched on july 26 1971 with david scott alfred worden and james irwin scott and irwin landed on july 30 near hadley rille and spent just under two days 19 hours on the surface in over 18 hours of eva they collected about 77 kilograms 170 lb of lunar material
apollo 16 landed in the descartes highlands on april 20 1972 the crew was commanded by john young with ken mattingly and charles duke young and duke spent just under three days on the surface with a total of over 20 hours eva
apollo 17 was the last of the apollo program landing in the taurus-littrow region in december 1972 eugene cernan commanded ronald e evans and nasas first scientist-astronaut geologist dr harrison h schmitt schmitt was originally scheduled for apollo 18 but the lunar geological community lobbied for his inclusion on the final lunar landing cernan and schmitt stayed on the surface for just over three days and spent just over 23 hours of total eva

 samples returned 

the apollo program returned over 382 kg 842 lb of lunar rocks and soil to the lunar receiving laboratory in houston today 75% of the samples are stored at the lunar sample laboratory facility built in 1979
the rocks collected from the moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on earth as measured by radiometric dating techniques they range in age from about 3.2 billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria to about 4.6 billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust as such they represent samples from a very early period in the development of the solar system that are largely absent on earth one important rock found during the apollo program is dubbed the genesis rock retrieved by astronauts david scott and james irwin during the apollo 15 mission this anorthosite rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium-rich feldspar mineral anorthite and is believed to be representative of the highland crust a geochemical component called kreep was discovered by apollo 12 which has no known terrestrial counterpart kreep and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the moon was once completely molten see lunar magma ocean
almost all the rocks show evidence of impact process effects many samples appear to be pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters which is never seen on earth rocks due to the thick atmosphere many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events some of the returned samples are of impact melt materials melted near an impact crater all samples returned from the moon are highly brecciated as a result of being subjected to multiple impact events
analysis of composition of the lunar samples supports the giant impact hypothesis that the moon was created through impact of a large astronomical body with the earth


 costs 
when president kennedy first chartered the moon landing program a preliminary cost estimate of 7 billion was generated but this proved an extremely unrealistic guess of what could not possibly be determined precisely and james webb used his judgment as administrator to change the estimate to 20 billion before giving it to vice president johnson
when kennedy made his 1962 speech at rice university the annual space budget was 5.4 billion and he described this cost as 40 cents per person per week somewhat less than we pay for cigarettes and cigars every year but that the moon program would soon raise this to more than 50 cents a week for every man woman and child in the united states
webbs estimate shocked many at the time including the president but ultimately proved to be reasonably accurate in january 1969 nasa prepared an itemized estimate of the run-out cost of the apollo program the total came to 23.9 billion itemized as follows
the final cost of apollo was reported to congress as 25.4 billion in 1973 it took up the majority of nasas budget while it was being developed for example in 1966 it accounted for about 60 percent of nasas total 5.2 billion budget that was one of the biggest investment of the us in science research and development and employed thousands of american scientists a single saturn v launch in 1969 cost up to 375 million compared to the national science foundations fiscal year 1970 budget of 440 million
in 2009 nasa held a symposium on project costs which presented an estimate of the apollo program costs in 2005 dollars as roughly 170 billion 206 billion in 2016 dollars this included all research and development costs the procurement of 15 saturn v rockets 16 commandservice modules 12 lunar modules plus program support and management costs construction expenses for facilities and their upgrading and costs for flight operations this was based on a congressional budget office report a budgetary analysis of nasas new vision for space september 2004 the space review estimated in 2010 the cost of apollo from 1959 to 1973 as 20.4 billion or 109 billion in 2010 dollars 120 billion in 2016 dollars


 apollo applications program 

looking beyond the manned lunar landings nasa investigated several post-lunar applications for apollo hardware the apollo extension series apollo x proposed up to 30 flights to earth orbit using the space in the spacecraft lunar module adapter sla to house a small orbital laboratory workshop astronauts would continue to use the csm as a ferry to the station this study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty s-ivb saturn upper stage and grew into the apollo applications program aap the workshop was to be supplemented by the apollo telescope mount which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack the most ambitious plan called for using an empty s-ivb as an interplanetary spacecraft for a venus fly-by mission
the s-ivb orbital workshop was the only one of these plans to make it off the drawing board dubbed skylab it was constructed complete on the ground rather than in space and launched in 1973 using the two lower stages of a saturn v it was equipped with an apollo telescope mount skylabs last crew departed the station on february 8 1974 and the station itself re-entered the atmosphere in 1979
the apollo-soyuz test project also used apollo hardware for the first joint nation space flight paving the way for future cooperation with other nations in the space shuttle and international space station programs


 recent observations 

in september 2007 the x prize foundation and google announced the google lunar x prize to be awarded for a robotic lunar landing mission which transmits close-up images of the apollo lunar modules and other artificial objects on the surface
in 2008 japan aerospace exploration agencys selene probe observed evidence of the halo surrounding the apollo 15 lunar module blast crater while orbiting above the lunar surface in 2009 nasas robotic lunar reconnaissance orbiter while orbiting 50 kilometers 31 mi above the moon began photographing the remnants of the apollo program left on the lunar surface and photographed each site where manned apollo flights landed all of the u s flags left on the moon during the apollo missions were found to still be standing with the exception of the one left during the apollo 11 mission which was blown over during that missions lift-off from the lunar surface and return to the mission command module in lunar orbit the degree to which these flags retain their original colors remains unknown
in a november 16 2009 editorial the new york times opined

theres something terribly wistful about these photographs of the apollo landing sites the detail is such that if neil armstrong were walking there now we could make him out make out his footsteps even like the astronaut footpath clearly visible in the photos of the apollo 14 site perhaps the wistfulness is caused by the sense of simple grandeur in those apollo missions perhaps too it’s a reminder of the risk we all felt after the eagle had landed – the possibility that it might be unable to lift off again and the astronauts would be stranded on the moon but it may also be that a photograph like this one is as close as we’re able to come to looking directly back into the human past
there the apollo 11 lunar module sits parked just where it landed 40 years ago as if it still really were 40 years ago and all the time since merely imaginary


 legacy 


 science and engineering 

the apollo program has been called the greatest technological achievement in human history apollo stimulated many areas of technology leading to over 1,800 spinoff products as of 2015 the flight computer design used in both the lunar and command modules was along with the polaris and minuteman missile systems the driving force behind early research into integrated circuits ic by 1963 apollo was using 60 percent of the united states production of ics the crucial difference between the requirements of apollo and the missile programs was apollos much greater need for reliability while the navy and air force could work around reliability problems by deploying more missiles the political and financial cost of failure of an apollo mission was unacceptably high


 cultural impact 

the crew of apollo 8 sent the first live televised pictures of the earth and the moon back to earth and read from the creation story in the book of genesis on christmas eve 1968 an estimated one quarter of the population of the world saw—either live or delayed—the christmas eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the moon and an estimated one fifth of the population of the world watched the live transmission of the apollo 11 moonwalk

the apollo program also affected environmental activism in the 1970s due to photos taken by the astronauts the most famous taken by the apollo 17 astronauts is the blue marble this image which was released during a surge in environmentalism became a symbol of the environmental movement as a depiction of earths frailty vulnerability and isolation amid the vast expanse of space
according to the economist apollo succeeded in accomplishing president kennedys goal of taking on the soviet union in the space race and beat it by accomplishing a singular and significant achievement and thereby showcased the superiority of the free-market system as represented by the us the publication noted the irony that in order to achieve the goal the program required the organization of tremendous public resources within a vast centralized government bureaucracy
there are those who despite evidence to the contrary deny that the moon landings took place the apollo moon landing hoax claims helped propel conspiracy theories into a quasi-political narrative


 apollo 11 broadcast data restoration project 

as part of apollo 11s 40th anniversary in 2009 nasa spearheaded an effort to digitally restore the existing videotapes of the missions live televised moonwalk after an exhaustive three-year search for missing tapes of the original video of the apollo 11 moonwalk nasa concluded the data tapes had more than likely been accidentally erased

were all saddened that theyre not there we all wish we had 20-20 hindsight i dont think anyone in the nasa organization did anything wrong i think it slipped through the cracks and nobodys happy about it

the moon landing data was recorded by a special apollo tv camera which recorded in a format incompatible with broadcast tv this resulted in lunar footage that had to be converted for the live television broadcast and stored on magnetic telemetry tapes during the following years a magnetic tape shortage prompted nasa to remove massive numbers of magnetic tapes from the national archives and records administration to be recorded over with newer satellite data stan lebar who led the team that designed and built the lunar television camera at westinghouse electric corporation also worked with nafzger to try to locate the missing tapes

so i dont believe that the tapes exist today at all it was a hard thing to accept but there was just an overwhelming amount of evidence that led us to believe that they just dont exist anymore and you have to accept reality

with a budget of 230,000 the surviving original lunar broadcast data from apollo 11 was compiled by nafzger and assigned to lowry digital for restoration the video was processed to remove random noise and camera shake without destroying historical legitimacy the images were from tapes in australia the cbs news archive and kinescope recordings made at johnson space center the restored video remaining in black and white contains conservative digital enhancements and did not include sound quality improvements
