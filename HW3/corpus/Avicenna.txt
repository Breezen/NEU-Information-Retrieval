avicenna  also ibn sīnā or abu ali sina persian ابن سینا‎ c 980 – june 1037 was a persian polymath who is regarded as one of the most significant physicians astronomers thinkers and writers of the islamic golden age he has been described as the father of early modern medicine of the 450 works he is known to have written around 240 have survived including 150 on philosophy and 40 on medicine
his most famous works are the book of healing a philosophical and scientific encyclopedia and the canon of medicine a medical encyclopedia which became a standard medical text at many medieval universities and remained in use as late as 1650 in 1973 avicennas canon of medicine was reprinted in new york
besides philosophy and medicine avicennas corpus includes writings on astronomy alchemy geography and geology psychology islamic theology logic mathematics physics and works of poetry


 name 
avicenna is a latin corruption of the arabic patronym ibn sīnā ابن سينا meaning son of sina a rare persian masculine given name of uncertain etymology however avicenna was not the son but the great-great-grandson of a man named sina his full name was abū ʿalī al-ḥusayn ibn ʿabd allāh ibn al-ḥasan ibn ʿalī ibn sīnā أبو علي الحسين بن عبد الله بن الحسن بن علي بن سينا


 circumstances 
ibn sina created an extensive corpus of works during what is commonly known as the islamic golden age in which the translations of greco-roman persian and indian texts were studied extensively greco-roman mid- and neo-platonic and aristotelian texts translated by the kindi school were commented redacted and developed substantially by islamic intellectuals who also built upon persian and indian mathematical systems astronomy algebra trigonometry and medicine the samanid dynasty in the eastern part of persia greater khorasan and central asia as well as the buyid dynasty in the western part of persia and iraq provided a thriving atmosphere for scholarly and cultural development under the samanids bukhara rivaled baghdad as a cultural capital of the islamic world
the study of the quran and the hadith thrived in such a scholarly atmosphere philosophy fiqh and theology kalaam were further developed most noticeably by avicenna and his opponents al-razi and al-farabi had provided methodology and knowledge in medicine and philosophy avicenna had access to the great libraries of balkh khwarezm gorgan rey isfahan and hamadan various texts such as the ahd with bahmanyar show that he debated philosophical points with the greatest scholars of the time aruzi samarqandi describes how before avicenna left khwarezm he had met al-biruni a famous scientist and astronomer abu nasr iraqi a renowned mathematician abu sahl masihi a respected philosopher and abu al-khayr khammar a great physician


 biography 


 early life 
avicenna was born c 980 in afshana a village near bukhara in present-day uzbekistan the capital of the samanids a persian dynasty in central asia and greater khorasan his mother named sitāra was from bukhara his father abdullāh was a respected ismaili scholar from balkh an important town of the samanid empire in what is today balkh province afghanistan his father worked in the government of samanid in the village kharmasain a sunni regional power after five years his younger brother mahmoud was born avicenna first began to learn the quran and literature in such a way that when he was ten years old he had essentially learned all of them
according to his autobiography avicenna had memorised the entire quran by the age of 10 he learned indian arithmetic from an indian greengrocer mahmoud massahi and he began to learn more from a wandering scholar who gained a livelihood by curing the sick and teaching the young he also studied fiqh islamic jurisprudence under the sunni hanafi scholar ismail al-zahid avicenna was taught some extent of philosophy books such as introduction isagoges porphyry philosopher euclids elements ptolemys almagest by an unpopular philosopher abu abdullah nateli who claimed philosophizing
as a teenager he was greatly troubled by the metaphysics of aristotle which he could not understand until he read al-farabis commentary on the work for the next year and a half he studied philosophy in which he encountered greater obstacles in such moments of baffled inquiry he would leave his books perform the requisite ablutions then go to the mosque and continue in prayer till light broke on his difficulties deep into the night he would continue his studies and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution forty times it is said he read through the metaphysics of aristotle till the words were imprinted on his memory but their meaning was hopelessly obscure until one day they found illumination from the little commentary by farabi which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhams so great was his joy at the discovery made with the help of a work from which he had expected only mystery that he hastened to return thanks to god and bestowed alms upon the poor
he turned to medicine at 16 and not only learned medical theory but also by gratuitous attendance of the sick had according to his own account discovered new methods of treatment the teenager achieved full status as a qualified physician at age 18 and found that medicine is no hard and thorny science like mathematics and metaphysics so i soon made great progress i became an excellent doctor and began to treat patients using approved remedies the youthful physicians fame spread quickly and he treated many patients without asking for payment
a number of theories have been proposed regarding avicennas madhab school of thought within islamic jurisprudence medieval historian ẓahīr al-dīn al-bayhaqī d 1169 considered avicenna to be a follower of the brethren of purity on the other hand dimitri gutas along with aisha khan and jules j janssens demonstrated that avicenna was a sunni hanafi however the 14th century shia faqih nurullah shushtari according to seyyed hossein nasr maintained that he was most likely a twelver shia conversely sharaf khorasani citing a rejection of an invitation of the sunni governor sultan mahmoud ghazanavi by avicenna to his court believes that avicenna was an ismaili similar disagreements exist on the background of avicennas family whereas some writers considered them sunni some more recent writers contested that they were shia


 adulthood 

ibn sinas first appointment was that of physician to the emir nuh ii who owed him his recovery from a dangerous illness 997 ibn sinas chief reward for this service was access to the royal library of the samanids well-known patrons of scholarship and scholars when the library was destroyed by fire not long after the enemies of ibn sina accused him of burning it in order for ever to conceal the sources of his knowledge meanwhile he assisted his father in his financial labors but still found time to write some of his earliest works
when ibn sina was 22 years old he lost his father the samanid dynasty came to its end in december 1004 ibn sina seems to have declined the offers of mahmud of ghazni and proceeded westwards to urgench in modern turkmenistan where the vizier regarded as a friend of scholars gave him a small monthly stipend the pay was small however so ibn sina wandered from place to place through the districts of nishapur and merv to the borders of khorasan seeking an opening for his talents qabus the generous ruler of tabaristan himself a poet and a scholar with whom ibn sina had expected to find asylum was on about that date 1012 starved to death by his troops who had revolted ibn sina himself was at this time stricken by a severe illness finally at gorgan near the caspian sea ibn sina met with a friend who bought a dwelling near his own house in which ibn sina lectured on logic and astronomy several of ibn sinas treatises were written for this patron and the commencement of his canon of medicine also dates from his stay in hyrcania
ibn sina subsequently settled at rey in the vicinity of modern tehran the home town of rhazes where majd addaula a son of the last buwayhid emir was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother seyyedeh khatun about thirty of ibn sinas shorter works are said to have been composed in rey constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son shams al-daula however compelled the scholar to quit the place after a brief sojourn at qazvin he passed southwards to hamadãn where shams al-daula another buwayhid emir had established himself at first ibn sina entered into the service of a high-born lady but the emir hearing of his arrival called him in as medical attendant and sent him back with presents to his dwelling ibn sina was even raised to the office of vizier the emir decreed that he should be banished from the country ibn sina however remained hidden for forty days in sheikh ahmed fadhels house until a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post even during this perturbed time ibn sina persevered with his studies and teaching every evening extracts from his great works the canon and the sanatio were dictated and explained to his pupils on the death of the emir ibn sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an apothecary where with intense assiduity he continued the composition of his works
meanwhile he had written to abu yafar the prefect of the dynamic city of isfahan offering his services the new emir of hamadan hearing of this correspondence and discovering where ibn sina was hiding incarcerated him in a fortress war meanwhile continued between the rulers of isfahan and hamadãn in 1024 the former captured hamadan and its towns expelling the tajik mercenaries when the storm had passed ibn sina returned with the emir to hamadan and carried on his literary labors later however accompanied by his brother a favorite pupil and two slaves ibn sina escaped from the city in the dress of a sufi ascetic after a perilous journey they reached isfahan receiving an honorable welcome from the prince


 later life and death 

the remaining ten or twelve years of ibn sīnās life were spent in the service of the kakuyid ruler muhammad ibn rustam dushmanziyar also known as ala al-dawla whom he accompanied as physician and general literary and scientific adviser even in his numerous campaigns
during these years he began to study literary matters and philology instigated it is asserted by criticisms on his style a severe colic which seized him on the march of the army against hamadan was checked by remedies so violent that ibn sina could scarcely stand on a similar occasion the disease returned with difficulty he reached hamadan where finding the disease gaining ground he refused to keep up the regimen imposed and resigned himself to his fate
his friends advised him to slow down and take life moderately he refused however stating that i prefer a short life with width to a narrow one with length on his deathbed remorse seized him he bestowed his goods on the poor restored unjust gains freed his slaves and read through the quran every three days until his death he died in june 1037 in his fifty-eighth year in the month of ramadan and was buried in hamadan iran


 philosophy 
ibn sīnā wrote extensively on early islamic philosophy especially the subjects logic ethics and metaphysics including treatises named logic and metaphysics most of his works were written in arabic – then the language of science in the middle east – and some in persian of linguistic significance even to this day are a few books that he wrote in nearly pure persian language particularly the danishnamah-yi ala philosophy for ala ad-dawla ibn sīnās commentaries on aristotle often criticized the philosopher encouraging a lively debate in the spirit of ijtihad
avicennas neoplatonic scheme of emanations became fundamental in the kalam school of theological discourse in the 12th century
his book of healing became available in europe in partial latin translation some fifty years after its composition under the title sufficientia and some authors have identified a latin avicennism as flourishing for some time paralleling the more influential latin averroism but suppressed by the parisian decrees of 1210 and 1215
avicennas psychology and theory of knowledge influenced william of auvergne bishop of paris and albertus magnus while his metaphysics influenced the thought of thomas aquinas


 metaphysical doctrine 
early islamic philosophy and islamic metaphysics imbued as it is with islamic theology distinguishes more clearly than aristotelianism between essence and existence whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental essence endures within a being beyond the accidental the philosophy of ibn sīnā particularly that part relating to metaphysics owes much to al-farabi the search for a definitive islamic philosophy separate from occasionalism can be seen in what is left of his work
following al-farabis lead avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being in which he distinguished between essence mahiat and existence wujud he argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things existence must therefore be due to an agent-cause that necessitates imparts gives or adds existence to an essence to do so the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect
avicennas consideration of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being namely impossibility contingency and necessity avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist while the contingent in itself mumkin bi-dhatihi has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction when actualized the contingent becomes a necessary existent due to what is other than itself wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi thus contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself the metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different necessary being due to itself wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi is true in itself while the contingent being is false in itself and true due to something else other than itself the necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence it is what always exists
the necessary exists due-to-its-self and has no quiddityessence mahiyya other than existence wujud furthermore it is one wahid ahad since there cannot be more than one necessary-existent-due-to-itself without differentia fasl to distinguish them from each other yet to require differentia entails that they exist due-to-themselves as well as due to what is other than themselves and this is contradictory however if no differentia distinguishes them from each other then there is no sense in which these existents are not one and the same avicenna adds that the necessary-existent-due-to-itself has no genus jins nor a definition hadd nor a counterpart nadd nor an opposite did and is detached bari from matter madda quality kayf quantity kam place ayn situation wad and time waqt
avicennas theology on metaphysical issues ilāhiyyāt has been criticized by some islamic scholars among them al-ghazali ibn taymiyya and ibn al-qayyim while discussing the views of the theists among the greek philosophers namely socrates plato and aristotle in al-munqidh min ad-dalal deliverance from error al-ghazali noted that the greek philosophers must be taxed with unbelief as must their partisans among the muslim philosophers such as ibn sina and al-farabi and their likes he added that none however of the muslim philosophers engaged so much in transmitting aristotles lore as did the two men just mentioned  the sum of what we regard as the authentic philosophy of aristotle as transmitted by al-farabi and ibn sina can be reduced to three parts a part which must be branded as unbelief a part which must be stigmatized as innovation and a part which need not be repudiated at all


 argument for gods existence 

avicenna made an argument for the existence of god which would be known as the proof of the truthful arabic al-burhan al-siddiqin avicenna argued that there must be a necessary existent arabic wajib al-wujud an entity that cannot not exist and through a series of argument he identified it with god of islam present-day historian of philosophy peter adamson called this argument one of the most influential medieval arguments for gods existence and avicennas biggest contribution to the history of philosophy


 al-biruni correspondence 
correspondence between ibn sina with his student ahmad ibn ali al-masumi and al-biruni has survived in which they debated aristotelian natural philosophy and the peripatetic school abu rayhan began by asking avicenna eighteen questions ten of which were criticisms of aristotles on the heavens


 theology 
avicenna was a devout muslim and sought to reconcile rational philosophy with islamic theology his aim was to prove the existence of god and his creation of the world scientifically and through reason and logic avicennas views on islamic theology and philosophy were enormously influential forming part of the core of the curriculum at islamic religious schools until the 19th century avicenna wrote a number of short treatises dealing with islamic theology these included treatises on the prophets whom he viewed as inspired philosophers and also on various scientific and philosophical interpretations of the quran such as how quranic cosmology corresponds to his own philosophical system in general these treatises linked his philosophical writings to islamic religious ideas for example the bodys afterlife
there are occasional brief hints and allusions in his longer works however that avicenna considered philosophy as the only sensible way to distinguish real prophecy from illusion he did not state this more clearly because of the political implications of such a theory if prophecy could be questioned and also because most of the time he was writing shorter works which concentrated on explaining his theories on philosophy and theology clearly without digressing to consider epistemological matters which could only be properly considered by other philosophers
later interpretations of avicennas philosophy split into three different schools those such as al-tusi who continued to apply his philosophy as a system to interpret later political events and scientific advances those such as al-razi who considered avicennas theological works in isolation from his wider philosophical concerns and those such as al-ghazali who selectively used parts of his philosophy to support their own attempts to gain greater spiritual insights through a variety of mystical means it was the theological interpretation championed by those such as al-razi which eventually came to predominate in the madrasahs
avicenna memorized the quran by the age of ten and as an adult he wrote five treatises commenting on suras from the quran one of these texts included the proof of prophecies in which he comments on several quranic verses and holds the quran in high esteem avicenna argued that the islamic prophets should be considered higher than philosophers


 thought experiments 

while he was imprisoned in the castle of fardajan near hamadhan avicenna wrote his famous floating man – literally falling man – thought experiment to demonstrate human self-awareness and the substantiality and immateriality of the soul avicenna believed his floating man thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input the thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air isolated from all sensations which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies he argued that in this scenario one would still have self-consciousness because it is conceivable that a person suspended in air while cut off from sense experience would still be capable of determining his own existence the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection independent of the body and an immaterial substance the conceivability of this floating man indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually which entails the souls separateness from the body avicenna referred to the living human intelligence particularly the active intellect which he believed to be the hypostasis by which god communicates truth to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature following is an english translation of the argument

one of us ie a human being should be imagined as having been created in a single stroke created perfect and complete but with his vision obscured so that he cannot perceive external entities created falling through air or a void in such a manner that he is not struck by the firmness of the air in any way that compels him to feel it and with his limbs separated so that they do not come in contact with or touch each other then contemplate the following can he be assured of the existence of himself he does not have any doubt in that his self exists without thereby asserting that he has any exterior limbs nor any internal organs neither heart nor brain nor any one of the exterior things at all but rather he can affirm the existence of himself without thereby asserting there that this self has any extension in space even if it were possible for him in that state to imagine a hand or any other limb he would not imagine it as being a part of his self nor as a condition for the existence of that self for as you know that which is asserted is different from that which is not asserted and that which is inferred is different from that which is not inferred therefore the self the existence of which has been asserted is a unique characteristic in as much that it is not as such the same as the body or the limbs which have not been ascertained thus that which is ascertained ie the self does have a way of being sure of the existence of the soul as something other than the body even something non-bodily this he knows this he should understand intuitively if it is that he is ignorant of it and needs to be beaten with a stick to realize it

however avicenna posited the brain as the place where reason interacts with sensation sensation prepares the soul to receive rational concepts from the universal agent intellect the first knowledge of the flying person would be i am affirming his or her essence that essence could not be the body obviously as the flying person has no sensation thus the knowledge that i am is the core of a human being the soul exists and is self-aware avicenna thus concluded that the idea of the self is not logically dependent on any physical thing and that the soul should not be seen in relative terms but as a primary given a substance the body is unnecessary in relation to it the soul is its perfection in itself the soul is an immaterial substance


 the canon of medicine 

avicenna authored a five-volume medical encyclopedia the canon of medicine al-qanun fit-tibb it was used as the standard medical textbook in the islamic world and europe up to the 18th century the canon still plays an important role in unani medicine


 liber primus naturalium 
avicenna considered whether events like rare diseases or disorders have natural causes he used the example of polydactyly to explain his perception that causal reasons exist for all medical events this view of medical phenomena anticipated developments in the enlightenment by seven centuries


 the book of healing 


 earth sciences 
ibn sīnā wrote on earth sciences such as geology in the book of healing while discussing the formation of mountains he explained

either they are the effects of upheavals of the crust of the earth such as might occur during a violent earthquake or they are the effect of water which cutting itself a new route has denuded the valleys the strata being of different kinds some soft some hard  it would require a long period of time for all such changes to be accomplished during which the mountains themselves might be somewhat diminished in size


 philosophy of science 
in the al-burhan on demonstration section of the book of healing avicenna discussed the philosophy of science and described an early scientific method of inquiry he discusses aristotles posterior analytics and significantly diverged from it on several points avicenna discussed the issue of a proper methodology for scientific inquiry and the question of how does one acquire the first principles of a science he asked how a scientist would arrive at the initial axioms or hypotheses of a deductive science without inferring them from some more basic premises he explains that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a relation holds between the terms which would allow for absolute universal certainty avicenna then adds two further methods for arriving at the first principles the ancient aristotelian method of induction istiqra and the method of examination and experimentation tajriba avicenna criticized aristotelian induction arguing that it does not lead to the absolute universal and certain premises that it purports to provide in its place he develops a method of experimentation as a means for scientific inquiry


 logic 
an early formal system of temporal logic was studied by avicenna although he did not develop a real theory of temporal propositions he did study the relationship between temporalis and the implication avicennas work was further developed by najm al-dīn al-qazwīnī al-kātibī and became the dominant system of islamic logic until modern times avicennian logic also influenced several early european logicians such as albertus magnus and william of ockham avicenna endorsed the law of noncontradiction proposed by aristotle that a fact could not be both true and false at the same time and in the same sense of the terminology used he stated anyone who denies the law of noncontradiction should be beaten and burned until he admits that to be beaten is not the same as not to be beaten and to be burned is not the same as not to be burned


 physics 
in mechanics ibn sīnā in the book of healing developed a theory of motion in which he made a distinction between the inclination tendency to motion and force of a projectile and concluded that motion was a result of an inclination mayl transferred to the projectile by the thrower and that projectile motion in a vacuum would not cease he viewed inclination as a permanent force whose effect is dissipated by external forces such as air resistance
the theory of motion presented by avicenna was probably influenced by the 6th-century alexandrian scholar john philoponus avicennas is a less sophisticated variant of the theory of impetus developed by buridan in the 14th century it is unclear if buridan was influenced by avicenna or by philoponus directly
in optics ibn sina was among those who argued that light had a speed observing that if the perception of light is due to the emission of some sort of particles by a luminous source the speed of light must be finite he also provided a wrong explanation of the rainbow phenomenon carl benjamin boyer described avicennas ibn sīnā theory on the rainbow as follows

independent observation had demonstrated to him that the bow is not formed in the dark cloud but rather in the very thin mist lying between the cloud and the sun or observer the cloud he thought serves simply as the background of this thin substance much as a quicksilver lining is placed upon the rear surface of the glass in a mirror ibn sīnā would change the place not only of the bow but also of the color formation holding the iridescence to be merely a subjective sensation in the eye

in 1253 a latin text entitled speculum tripartitum stated the following regarding avicennas theory on heat

avicenna says in his book of heaven and earth that heat is generated from motion in external things


 psychology 
avicennas legacy in classical psychology is primarily embodied in the kitab al-nafs parts of his kitab al-shifa the book of healing and kitab al-najat the book of deliverance these were known in latin under the title de anima treatises on the soul notably avicenna develops what is called the flying man argument in the psychology of the cure i1.7 as defense of the argument that the soul is without quantitative extension which has an affinity with descartess cogito argument or what phenomenology designates as a form of an epoche
avicennas psychology requires that connection between the body and soul be strong enough to ensure the souls individuation but weak enough to allow for its immortality avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception thus the philosophers connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception in this way bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect in sense perception the perceiver senses the form of the object first by perceiving features of the object by our external senses this sensory information is supplied to the internal senses which merge all the pieces into a whole unified conscious experience this process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body for the material body may only perceive material objects while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial universal forms the way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction which takes place in the physical body
the soul completes the action of intellection by accepting forms that have been abstracted from matter this process requires a concrete particular material to be abstracted into the universal intelligible immaterial the material and immaterial interact through the active intellect which is a divine light containing the intelligible forms the active intellect reveals the universals concealed in material objects much like the sun makes color available to our eyes


 other contributions 


 astronomy and astrology 
avicenna wrote an attack on astrology titled resāla fī ebṭāl aḥkām al-nojūm in which he cited passages from the quran to dispute the power of astrology to foretell the future he believed that each planet had some influence on the earth but argued against astrologers being able to determine the exact effects
avicennas astronomical writings had some influence on later writers although in general his work could be considered less developed than alhazen or al-biruni one important feature of his writing is that he considers mathematical astronomy as a separate discipline to astrology he criticized aristotles view of the stars receiving their light from the sun stating that the stars are self-luminous and believed that the planets are also self-luminous he claimed to have observed venus as a spot on the sun this is possible as there was a transit on may 24 1032 but avicenna did not give the date of his observation and modern scholars have questioned whether he could have observed the transit from his location at that time he may have mistaken a sunspot for venus he used his transit observation to help establish that venus was at least sometimes below the sun in ptolemaic cosmology ie the sphere of venus comes before the sphere of the sun when moving out from the earth in the prevailing geocentric model
he also wrote the summary of the almagest based on ptolemys almagest with an appended treatise to bring that which is stated in the almagest and what is understood from natural science into conformity for example avicenna considers the motion of the solar apogee which ptolemy had taken to be fixed


 chemistry 
ibn sīnā invented steam distillation and used it to produce essential oils such as rose essence forming the foundation of what later became aromatherapy
unlike for example al-razi ibn sīnā explicitly disputed the theory of the transmutation of substances commonly believed by alchemists

those of the chemical craft know well that no change can be effected in the different species of substances though they can produce the appearance of such change

four works on alchemy attributed to avicenna were translated into latin as
liber aboali abincine de anima in arte alchemiae
declaratio lapis physici avicennae filio sui aboali
avicennae de congelatione et conglutinatione lapidum
avicennae ad hasan regem epistola de re recta
liber aboali abincine de anima in arte alchemiae was the most influential having influenced later medieval chemists and alchemists such as vincent of beauvais however anawati argues following ruska that the de anima is a fake by a spanish author similarly the declaratio is believed not to be actually by avicenna the third work the book of minerals is agreed to be avicennas writing adapted from the kitab al-shifa book of the remedy ibn sina classified minerals into stones fusible substances sulfurs and salts building on the ideas of aristotle and jabir the epistola de re recta is somewhat less sceptical of alchemy anawati argues that it is by avicenna but written earlier in his career when he had not yet firmly decided that transmutation was impossible


 poetry 
almost half of ibn sīnās works are versified his poems appear in both arabic and persian as an example edward granville browne claims that the following persian verses are incorrectly attributed to omar khayyám and were originally written by ibn sīnā


 legacy 


 middle ages and renaissance 

as early as the 13th century when dante alighieri depicted him in limbo alongside the virtuous non-christian thinkers in his divine comedy such as virgil averroes homer horace ovid lucan socrates plato and saladin avicenna has been recognized by both east and west as one of the great figures in intellectual history
george sarton the author of the history of science described ibn sīnā as one of the greatest thinkers and medical scholars in history and called him the most famous scientist of islam and one of the most famous of all races places and times he was one of the islamic worlds leading writers in the field of medicine along with rhazes abulcasis ibn al-nafis and al-ibadi ibn sīnā is considered an important compiler of early muslim medicine he is remembered in the western history of medicine as a major historical figure who made important contributions to medicine and the european renaissance his medical texts were unusual in that where controversy existed between galen and aristotles views on medical matters such as anatomy he preferred to side with aristotle where necessary updating aristotles position to take into account post-aristotelian advances in anatomical knowledge aristotles dominant intellectual influence among medieval european scholars meant that avicennas linking of galens medical writings with aristotles philosophical writings in the canon of medicine along with its comprehensive and logical organisation of knowledge significantly increased avicennas importance in medieval europe in comparison to other islamic writers on medicine his influence following translation of the canon was such that from the early fourteenth to the mid-sixteenth centuries he was ranked with hippocrates and galen as one of the acknowledged authorities princeps medicorum prince of physicians


 modern reception 
in modern iran he is considered a national icon and is often regarded as one of the greatest persians to have ever lived a monument was erected outside the bukhara museum the avicenna mausoleum and museum in hamadan was built in 1952 bu-ali sina university in hamadan iran avicenna research institute in tehran iran the ibn sīnā tajik state medical university in dushanbe ibn sina academy of medieval medicine and sciences at aligarh india avicenna school in karachi and avicenna medical college in lahore pakistan ibne sina balkh medical school in his native province of balkh in afghanistan ibni sina faculty of medicine of ankara university ankara turkey the main classroom building the avicenna building of the sharif university of technology and ibn sina integrated school in marawi city philippines are all named in his honour his portrait hangs in the hall of the avicenna faculty of medicine in the university of paris there is also a crater on the moon named avicenna and a plant genus avicennia

in 1980 the soviet union which then ruled his birthplace bukhara celebrated the thousandth anniversary of avicennas birth by circulating various commemorative stamps with artistic illustrations and by erecting a bust of avicenna based on anthropological research by soviet scholars near his birthplace in qishlak afshona some 25 km 16 mi north of bukhara a training college for medical staff has been named for him on the grounds is a museum dedicated to his life times and work

the avicenna prize for ethics in science is awarded every two years by unesco and rewards individuals and groups in the field of ethics in science the prize was established in 2003 and named after avicenna the aim of the award is to promote ethical reflection on issues raised by advances in science and technology and to raise global awareness of the importance of ethics in science
in march 2008 it was announced that avicennas name would be used for new directories of education institutions for health care professionals worldwide the avicenna directories will list universities and schools where doctors public health practitioners pharmacists and others are educated the project team stated why avicenna avicenna  was  noted for his synthesis of knowledge from both east and west he has had a lasting influence on the development of medicine and health sciences the use of avicennas name symbolises the worldwide partnership that is needed for the promotion of health services of high quality

in june 2009 iran donated a persian scholars pavilion to united nations office in vienna which is placed in the central memorial plaza of the vienna international center the persian scholars pavilion at united nations in vienna austria is featuring the statues of four prominent iranian figures highlighting the iranian architectural features the pavilion is adorned with persian art forms and includes the statues of renowned iranian scientists avicenna al-biruni zakariya razi rhazes and omar khayyam

 arabic works 
the treatises of ibn sīnā influenced later muslim thinkers in many areas including theology philology mathematics astronomy physics and music his works numbered almost 450 volumes on a wide range of subjects of which around 240 have survived in particular 150 volumes of his surviving works concentrate on philosophy and 40 of them concentrate on medicine his most famous works are the book of healing and the canon of medicine
ibn sīnā wrote at least one treatise on alchemy but several others have been falsely attributed to him his logic metaphysics physics and de caelo are treatises giving a synoptic view of aristotelian doctrine though metaphysics demonstrates a significant departure from the brand of neoplatonism known as aristotelianism in ibn sīnās world arabic philosophers have hinted at the idea that ibn sīnā was attempting to re-aristotelianise muslim philosophy in its entirety unlike his predecessors who accepted the conflation of platonic aristotelian neo- and middle-platonic works transmitted into the muslim world
the logic and metaphysics have been extensively reprinted the latter eg at venice in 1493 1495 and 1546 some of his shorter essays on medicine logic etc take a poetical form the poem on logic was published by schmoelders in 1836 two encyclopaedic treatises dealing with philosophy are often mentioned the larger al-shifa sanatio exists nearly complete in manuscript in the bodleian library and elsewhere part of it on the de anima appeared at pavia 1490 as the liber sextus naturalium and the long account of ibn sinas philosophy given by muhammad al-shahrastani seems to be mainly an analysis and in many places a reproduction of the al-shifa a shorter form of the work is known as the an-najat liberatio the latin editions of part of these works have been modified by the corrections which the monastic editors confess that they applied there is also a حكمت مشرقيه hikmat-al-mashriqqiyya in latin philosophia orientalis mentioned by roger bacon the majority of which is lost in antiquity which according to averroes was pantheistic in tone
