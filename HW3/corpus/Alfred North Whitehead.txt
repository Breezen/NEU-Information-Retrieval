alfred north whitehead  15 february 1861 – 30 december 1947 was an english mathematician and philosopher he is best known as the defining figure of the philosophical school known as process philosophy which today has found application to a wide variety of disciplines including ecology theology education physics biology economics and psychology among other areas
in his early career whitehead wrote primarily on mathematics logic and physics his most notable work in these fields is the three-volume principia mathematica 1910–13 which he wrote with former student bertrand russell principia mathematica is considered one of the twentieth centurys most important works in mathematical logic and placed 23rd in a list of the top 100 english-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century by modern library
beginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to philosophy of science and finally to metaphysics he developed a comprehensive metaphysical system which radically departed from most of western philosophy whitehead argued that reality consists of processes rather than material objects and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another today whiteheads philosophical works – particularly process and reality – are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy
whiteheads process philosophy argues that there is urgency in coming to see the world as a web of interrelated processes of which we are integral parts so that all of our choices and actions have consequences for the world around us for this reason one of the most promising applications of whiteheads thought in recent years has been in the area of ecological civilization and environmental ethics pioneered by john b cobb jr


 life 


 childhood education 

alfred north whitehead was born in ramsgate kent england in 1861 his father alfred whitehead was a minister and schoolmaster of chatham house academy a school for boys established by thomas whitehead alfred norths grandfather whitehead himself recalled both of them as being very successful schoolmasters but that his grandfather was the more extraordinary man whiteheads mother was maria sarah whitehead formerly maria sarah buckmaster whitehead was apparently not particularly close with his mother as he never mentioned her in any of his writings and there is evidence that whiteheads wife evelyn had a low opinion of her
whitehead was educated at sherborne school dorset then considered one of the best public schools in the country his childhood was described as over-protected but when at school he excelled in sports and mathematics and was head prefect of his class
in 1880 whitehead began attending trinity college cambridge and studied mathematics his academic advisor was edward john routh he earned his ba from trinity in 1884 and graduated as fourth wrangler


 career 
elected a fellow of trinity in 1884 whitehead would teach and write on mathematics and physics at the college until 1910 spending the 1890s writing his treatise on universal algebra 1898 and the 1900s collaborating with his former pupil bertrand russell on the first edition of principia mathematica he was a cambridge apostle
in 1890 whitehead married evelyn wade an irish woman raised in france they had a daughter jessie whitehead and two sons thomas north whitehead and eric whitehead eric whitehead died in action at the age of 19 while serving in the royal flying corps during world war i alfreds brother henry became bishop of madras and wrote a closely observed ethnographic account of the village gods of south-india calcutta association press 1921 which is still of value today

in 1910 whitehead resigned his senior lectureship in mathematics at trinity and moved to london without first lining up another job after being unemployed for a year whitehead accepted a position as lecturer in applied mathematics and mechanics at university college london but was passed over a year later for the goldsmid chair of applied mathematics and mechanics a position for which he had hoped to be seriously considered
in 1914 whitehead accepted a position as professor of applied mathematics at the newly chartered imperial college london where his old friend andrew forsyth had recently been appointed chief professor of mathematics
in 1918 whiteheads academic responsibilities began to seriously expand as he accepted a number of high administrative positions within the university of london system of which imperial college london was a member at the time he was elected dean of the faculty of science at the university of london in late 1918 a post he held for four years a member of the university of londons senate in 1919 and chairman of the senates academic leadership council in 1920 a post which he held until he departed for america in 1924 whitehead was able to exert his newfound influence to successfully lobby for a new history of science department help establish a bachelor of science degree previously only bachelor of arts degrees had been offered and make the school more accessible to less wealthy students
toward the end of his time in england whitehead turned his attention to philosophy though he had no advanced training in philosophy his philosophical work soon became highly regarded after publishing the concept of nature in 1920 he served as president of the aristotelian society from 1922 to 1923


 move to the us 1924 
in 1924 henry osborn taylor invited the 63-year-old whitehead to join the faculty at harvard university as a professor of philosophy
during his time at harvard whitehead produced his most important philosophical contributions in 1925 he wrote science and the modern world which was immediately hailed as an alternative to the cartesian dualism that plagued popular science lectures from 1927–28 were published in 1929 as a book named process and reality which has been compared both in importance and difficulty to kants critique of pure reason
the whiteheads spent the rest of their lives in the united states alfred north retired from harvard in 1937 and remained in cambridge massachusetts until his death on 30 december 1947
the two volume biography of whitehead by victor lowe is the most definitive presentation of the life of whitehead however many details of whiteheads life remain obscure because he left no nachlass his family carried out his instructions that all of his papers be destroyed after his death additionally whitehead was known for his almost fanatical belief in the right to privacy and for writing very few personal letters of the kind that would help to gain insight on his life this led to lowe himself remarking on the first page of whiteheads biography no professional biographer in his right mind would touch him
as of 2013 the whitehead research project of the center for process studies is currently working on a critical edition of whiteheads writings


 mathematics and logic 
in addition to numerous articles on mathematics whitehead wrote three major books on the subject a treatise on universal algebra 1898 principia mathematica co-written with bertrand russell and published in three volumes between 1910 and 1913 and an introduction to mathematics 1911 the former two books were aimed exclusively at professional mathematicians while the latter book was intended for a larger audience covering the history of mathematics and its philosophical foundations principia mathematica in particular is regarded as one of the most important works in mathematical logic of the 20th century
in addition to his legacy as a co-writer of principia mathematica whiteheads theory of extensive abstraction is considered foundational for the branch of ontology and computer science known as mereotopology a theory describing spatial relations among wholes parts parts of parts and the boundaries between parts


 a treatise on universal algebra 
in a treatise on universal algebra 1898 the term universal algebra had essentially the same meaning that it has today the study of algebraic structures themselves rather than examples models of algebraic structures whitehead credits william rowan hamilton and augustus de morgan as originators of the subject matter and james joseph sylvester with coining the term itself
at the time structures such as lie algebras and hyperbolic quaternions drew attention to the need to expand algebraic structures beyond the associatively multiplicative class in a review alexander macfarlane wrote the main idea of the work is not unification of the several methods nor generalization of ordinary algebra so as to include them but rather the comparative study of their several structures in a separate review g b mathews wrote it possesses a unity of design which is really remarkable considering the variety of its themes
a treatise on universal algebra sought to examine hermann grassmanns theory of extension ausdehnungslehre booles algebra of logic and hamiltons quaternions this last number system was to be taken up in volume ii which was never finished due to whiteheads work on principia mathematica whitehead wrote in the preface

such algebras have an intrinsic value for separate detailed study also they are worthy of comparative study for the sake of the light thereby thrown on the general theory of symbolic reasoning and on algebraic symbolism in particular  the idea of a generalized conception of space has been made prominent in the belief that the properties and operations involved in it can be made to form a uniform method of interpretation of the various algebras

whitehead however had no results of a general nature his hope of forming a uniform method of interpretation of the various algebras presumably would have been developed in volume ii had whitehead completed it further work on the subject was minimal until the early 1930s when garrett birkhoff and øystein ore began publishing on universal algebras


 principia mathematica 

principia mathematica 1910–1913 is whiteheads most famous mathematical work co-written with former student bertrand russell principia mathematica is considered one of the twentieth centurys most important works in mathematics and placed 23rd in a list of the top 100 english-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century by modern library
principia mathematicas purpose was to describe a set of axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic from which all mathematical truths could in principle be proven whitehead and russell were working on such a foundational level of mathematics and logic that it took them until page 86 of volume ii to prove that 112 a proof humorously accompanied by the comment the above proposition is occasionally useful
whitehead and russell had thought originally that principia mathematica would take a year to complete it ended up taking them ten years when it came time for publication the three-volume work was so long more than 2,000 pages and its audience so narrow professional mathematicians that it was initially published at a loss of 600 pounds 300 of which was paid by cambridge university press 200 by the royal society of london and 50 apiece by whitehead and russell themselves despite the initial loss today there is likely no major academic library in the world which does not hold a copy of principia mathematica
the ultimate substantive legacy of principia mathematica is mixed it is generally accepted that kurt gödels incompleteness theorem of 1931 definitively demonstrated that for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them and hence that principia mathematica could never achieve its aims however gödel could not have come to this conclusion without whitehead and russells book in this way principia mathematicas legacy might be described as its key role in disproving the possibility of achieving its own stated goals but beyond this somewhat ironic legacy the book popularized modern mathematical logic and drew important connections between logic epistemology and metaphysics


 an introduction to mathematics 
unlike whiteheads previous two books on mathematics an introduction to mathematics 1911 was not aimed exclusively at professional mathematicians but was intended for a larger audience the book covered the nature of mathematics its unity and internal structure and its applicability to nature whitehead wrote in the opening chapter

the object of the following chapters is not to teach mathematics but to enable students from the very beginning of their course to know what the science is about and why it is necessarily the foundation of exact thought as applied to natural phenomena

the book can be seen as an attempt to understand the growth in unity and interconnection of mathematics as a whole as well as an examination of the mutual influence of mathematics and philosophy language and physics although the book is little-read in some ways it prefigures certain points of whiteheads later work in philosophy and metaphysics


 views on education 
whitehead showed a deep concern for educational reform at all levels in addition to his numerous individually written works on the subject whitehead was appointed by britains prime minister david lloyd george as part of a 20-person committee to investigate the educational systems and practices of the uk in 1921 and recommend reform
whiteheads most complete work on education is the 1929 book the aims of education and other essays which collected numerous essays and addresses by whitehead on the subject published between 1912 and 1927 the essay from which aims of education derived its name was delivered as an address in 1916 when whitehead was president of the london branch of the mathematical association in it he cautioned against the teaching of what he called inert ideas – ideas that are disconnected scraps of information with no application to real life or culture he opined that education with inert ideas is not only useless it is above all things harmful
rather than teach small parts of a large number of subjects whitehead advocated teaching a relatively few important concepts that the student could organically link to many different areas of knowledge discovering their application in actual life for whitehead education should be the exact opposite of the multidisciplinary value-free school model – it should be transdisciplinary and laden with values and general principles that provide students with a bedrock of wisdom and help them to make connections between areas of knowledge that are usually regarded as separate
in order to make this sort of teaching a reality however whitehead pointed to the need to minimize the importance of or radically alter standard examinations for school entrance whitehead writes

every school is bound on pain of extinction to train its boys for a small set of definite examinations no headmaster has a free hand to develop his general education or his specialist studies in accordance with the opportunities of his school which are created by its staff its environment its class of boys and its endowments i suggest that no system of external tests which aims primarily at examining individual scholars can result in anything but educational waste

whitehead argued that curriculum should be developed specifically for its own students by its own staff or else risk total stagnation interrupted only by occasional movements from one group of inert ideas to another
above all else in his educational writings whitehead emphasized the importance of imagination and the free play of ideas in his essay universities and their function whitehead writes provocatively on imagination

imagination is not to be divorced from the facts it is a way of illuminating the facts it works by eliciting the general principles which apply to the facts as they exist and then by an intellectual survey of alternative possibilities which are consistent with those principles it enables men to construct an intellectual vision of a new world

whiteheads philosophy of education might adequately be summarized in his statement that knowledge does not keep any better than fish in other words bits of disconnected knowledge are meaningless all knowledge must find some imaginative application to the students own lives or else it becomes so much useless trivia and the students themselves become good at parroting facts but not thinking for themselves


 philosophy and metaphysics 

whitehead did not begin his career as a philosopher in fact he never had any formal training in philosophy beyond his undergraduate education early in his life he showed great interest in and respect for philosophy and metaphysics but it is evident that he considered himself a rank amateur in one letter to his friend and former student bertrand russell after discussing whether science aimed to be explanatory or merely descriptive he wrote this further question lands us in the ocean of metaphysic onto which my profound ignorance of that science forbids me to enter ironically in later life whitehead would become one of the 20th centurys foremost metaphysicians
however interest in metaphysics – the philosophical investigation of the nature of the universe and existence – had become unfashionable by the time whitehead began writing in earnest about it in the 1920s the ever-more impressive accomplishments of empirical science had led to a general consensus in academia that the development of comprehensive metaphysical systems was a waste of time because they were not subject to empirical testing
whitehead was unimpressed by this objection in the notes of one of his students for a 1927 class whitehead was quoted as saying every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics what he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized in whiteheads view scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works all the time but such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned while whitehead acknowledged that philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles he argued that people need to continually re-imagine their basic assumptions about how the universe works if philosophy and science are to make any real progress even if that progress remains permanently asymptotic for this reason whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations as essential to both good science and good philosophy
perhaps foremost among what whitehead considered faulty metaphysical assumptions was the cartesian idea that reality is fundamentally constructed of bits of matter that exist totally independently of one another which he rejected in favor of an event-based or process ontology in which events are primary and are fundamentally interrelated and dependent on one another he also argued that the most basic elements of reality can all be regarded as experiential indeed that everything is constituted by its experience he used the term experience very broadly so that even inanimate processes such as electron collisions are said to manifest some degree of experience in this he went against descartes separation of two different kinds of real existence either exclusively material or else exclusively mental whitehead referred to his metaphysical system as philosophy of organism but it would become known more widely as process philosophy
whiteheads philosophy was highly original and soon garnered interest in philosophical circles after publishing the concept of nature in 1920 he served as president of the aristotelian society from 1922 to 1923 and henri bergson was quoted as saying that whitehead was the best philosopher writing in english so impressive and different was whiteheads philosophy that in 1924 he was invited to join the faculty at harvard university as a professor of philosophy at 63 years of age

this is not to say that whiteheads thought was widely accepted or even well understood his philosophical work is generally considered to be among the most difficult to understand in all of the western canon even professional philosophers struggled to follow whiteheads writings one famous story illustrating the level of difficulty of whiteheads philosophy centers around the delivery of whiteheads gifford lectures in 1927–28 – following arthur eddingtons lectures of the year previous – which whitehead would later publish as process and reality

eddington was a marvellous popular lecturer who had enthralled an audience of 600 for his entire course the same audience turned up to whiteheads first lecture but it was completely unintelligible not merely to the world at large but to the elect my father remarked to me afterwards that if he had not known whitehead well he would have suspected that it was an imposter making it up as he went along  the audience at subsequent lectures was only about half a dozen in all

indeed it may not be inappropriate to speculate that some fair portion of the respect generally shown to whitehead by his philosophical peers at the time arose from their sheer bafflement distinguished university of chicago divinity school theologian shailer mathews once remarked of whiteheads 1926 book religion in the making it is infuriating and i must say embarrassing as well to read page after page of relatively familiar words without understanding a single sentence
however mathews frustration with whiteheads books did not negatively affect his interest in fact there were numerous philosophers and theologians at chicagos divinity school that perceived the importance of what whitehead was doing without fully grasping all of the details and implications in 1927 they invited one of americas only whitehead experts – henry nelson wieman – to chicago to give a lecture explaining whiteheads thought wiemans lecture was so brilliant that he was promptly hired to the faculty and taught there for twenty years and for at least thirty years afterward chicagos divinity school was closely associated with whiteheads thought
shortly after whiteheads book process and reality appeared in 1929 wieman famously wrote in his 1930 review

not many people will read whiteheads recent book in this generation not many will read it in any generation but its influence will radiate through concentric circles of popularization until the common man will think and work in the light of it not knowing whence the light came after a few decades of discussion and analysis one will be able to understand it more readily than can now be done

wiemans words proved prophetic though process and reality has been called arguably the most impressive single metaphysical text of the twentieth century it has been little-read and little-understood partly because it demands – as isabelle stengers puts it – that its readers accept the adventure of the questions that will separate them from every consensus whitehead questioned western philosophys most dearly held assumptions about how the universe works but in doing so he managed to anticipate a number of 21st century scientific and philosophical problems and provide novel solutions


 whiteheads conception of reality 
whitehead was convinced that the scientific notion of matter was misleading as a way of describing the ultimate nature of things in his 1925 book science and the modern world he wrote that

there persists  a fixed scientific cosmology which presupposes the ultimate fact of an irreducible brute matter or material spread through space in a flux of configurations in itself such a material is senseless valueless purposeless it just does what it does do following a fixed routine imposed by external relations which do not spring from the nature of its being it is this assumption that i call scientific materialism also it is an assumption which i shall challenge as being entirely unsuited to the scientific situation at which we have now arrived

in whiteheads view there are a number of problems with this notion of irreducible brute matter first it obscures and minimizes the importance of change by thinking of any material thing like a rock or a person as being fundamentally the same thing throughout time with any changes to it being secondary to its nature scientific materialism hides the fact that nothing ever stays the same for whitehead change is fundamental and inescapable he emphasizes that all things flow
in whiteheads view then concepts such as quality matter and form are problematic these classical concepts fail to adequately account for change and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world they are useful abstractions but are not the worlds basic building blocks what is ordinarily conceived of as a single person for instance is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events after all people change all the time if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience these occasions of experience are logically distinct but are progressively connected in what whitehead calls a society of events by assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete what whitehead calls the fallacy of misplaced concreteness
to put it another way a thing or person is often seen as having a defining essence or a core identity that is unchanging and describes what the thing or person really is in this way of thinking things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity eg marks hair has turned gray as he has gotten older but he is still the same person but in whiteheads cosmology the only fundamentally existent things are discrete occasions of experience that overlap one another in time and space and jointly make up the enduring person or thing on the other hand what ordinary thinking often regards as the essence of a thing or the identitycore of a person is an abstract generalization of what is regarded as that person or things most important or salient features across time identities do not define people people define identities everything changes from moment to moment and to think of anything as having an enduring essence misses the fact that all things flow though it is often a useful way of speaking
whitehead pointed to the limitations of language as one of the main culprits in maintaining a materialistic way of thinking and acknowledged that it may be difficult to ever wholly move past such ideas in everyday speech after all each moment of each persons life can hardly be given a different proper name and it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is a different thing from what it was a moment ago yet the limitations of everyday living and everyday speech should not prevent people from realizing that material substances or essences are a convenient generalized description of a continuum of particular concrete processes no one questions that a ten-year-old person is quite different by the time he or she turns thirty years old and in many ways is not the same person at all whitehead points out that it is not philosophically or ontologically sound to think that a person is the same from one second to the next

a second problem with materialism is that it obscures the importance of relations it sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things the idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as being fundamentally separate in time and space and not necessarily related to anything but in whiteheads view relations take a primary role perhaps even more important than the relata themselves a student taking notes in one of whiteheads fall 1924 classes wrote that

reality applies to connections and only relatively to the things connected a is real for b and b is real for a but they are not absolutely real independent of each other

in fact whitehead describes any entity as in some sense nothing more and nothing less than the sum of its relations to other entities – its synthesis of and reaction to the world around it a real thing is just that which forces the rest of the universe to in some way conform to it that is to say if theoretically a thing made strictly no difference to any other entity ie it was not related to any other entity it could not be said to really exist relations are not secondary to what a thing is they are what the thing is
it must be emphasized however that an entity is not merely a sum of its relations but also a valuation of them and reaction to them for whitehead creativity is the absolute principle of existence and every entity whether it is a human being a tree or an electron has some degree of novelty in how it responds to other entities and is not fully determined by causal or mechanistic laws of course most entities do not have consciousness as a human beings actions cannot always be predicted the same can be said of where a trees roots will grow or how an electron will move or whether it will rain tomorrow moreover inability to predict an electrons movement for instance is not due to faulty understanding or inadequate technology rather the fundamental creativityfreedom of all entities means that there will always remain phenomena that are unpredictable
the other side of creativityfreedom as the absolute principle is that every entity is constrained by the social structure of existence ie its relations – each actual entity must conform to the settled conditions of the world around it freedom always exists within limits but an entitys uniqueness and individuality arise from its own self-determination as to just how it will take account of the world within the limits that have been set for it
in summary whitehead rejects the idea of separate and unchanging bits of matter as the most basic building blocks of reality in favor of the idea of reality as interrelated events in process he conceives of reality as composed of processes of dynamic becoming rather than static being emphasizing that all physical things change and evolve and that changeless essences such as matter are mere abstractions from the interrelated events that are the final real things that make up the world


 theory of perception 
since whiteheads metaphysics described a universe in which all entities experience he needed a new way of describing perception that was not limited to living self-conscious beings the term he coined was prehension which comes from the latin prehensio meaning to seize the term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious applying to people as well as electrons it is also intended to make clear whiteheads rejection of the theory of representative perception in which the mind only has private ideas about other entities for whitehead the term prehension indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself in this way entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations rather than being independent of them further whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes causal efficacy or physical prehension and presentational immediacy or conceptual prehension
whitehead describes causal efficacy as the experience dominating the primitive living organisms which have a sense for the fate from which they have emerged and the fate towards which they go it is in other words the sense of causal relations between entities a feeling of being influenced and affected by the surrounding environment unmediated by the senses presentational immediacy on the other hand is what is usually referred to as pure sense perception unmediated by any causal or symbolic interpretation even unconscious interpretation in other words it is pure appearance which may or may not be delusive eg mistaking an image in a mirror for the real thing
in higher organisms like people these two modes of perception combine into what whitehead terms symbolic reference which links appearance with causation in a process that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it by way of illustration whitehead uses the example of a persons encounter with a chair an ordinary person looks up sees a colored shape and immediately infers that it is a chair however an artist whitehead supposes might not have jumped to the notion of a chair but instead might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape this is not the normal human reaction most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct without even thinking about it moreover animals do the same thing using the same example whitehead points out that a dog would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such in this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions on the one hand and causal relations on the other and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality as the dog illustrates while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality as the artist illustrates


 evolution and value 
whitehead believed that when asking questions about the basic facts of existence questions about value and purpose can never be fully escaped this is borne out in his thoughts on abiogenesis or the hypothetical natural process by which life arises from simple organic compounds
whitehead makes the startling observation that life is comparatively deficient in survival value if humans can only exist for about a hundred years and rocks for eight hundred million then one is forced to ask why complex organisms ever evolved in the first place as whitehead humorously notes they certainly did not appear because they were better at that game than the rocks around them he then observes that the mark of higher forms of life is that they are actively engaged in modifying their environment an activity which he theorizes is directed toward the three-fold goal of living living well and living better in other words whitehead sees life as directed toward the purpose of increasing its own satisfaction without such a goal he sees the rise of life as totally unintelligible
for whitehead there is no such thing as wholly inert matter instead all things have some measure of freedom or creativity however small which allows them to be at least partly self-directed process philosopher david ray griffin coined the term panexperientialism the idea that all entities experience to describe whiteheads view and to distinguish it from panpsychism the idea that all matter has consciousness


 god 

whiteheads idea of god differs from traditional monotheistic notions perhaps his most famous and pointed criticism of the christian conception of god is that the church gave unto god the attributes which belonged exclusively to caesar here whitehead is criticizing christianity for defining god as primarily a divine king who imposes his will on the world and whose most important attribute is power as opposed to the most widely accepted forms of christianity whitehead emphasized an idea of god that he called the brief galilean vision of humility

it does not emphasize the ruling caesar or the ruthless moralist or the unmoved mover it dwells upon the tender elements in the world which slowly and in quietness operates by love and it finds purpose in the present immediacy of a kingdom not of this world love neither rules nor is it unmoved also it is a little oblivious as to morals it does not look to the future for it finds its own reward in the immediate present

it should be emphasized that for whitehead god is not necessarily tied to religion rather than springing primarily from religious faith whitehead saw god as necessary for his metaphysical system his system required that an order exist among possibilities an order that allowed for novelty in the world and provided an aim to all entities whitehead posited that these ordered potentials exist in what he called the primordial nature of god however whitehead was also interested in religious experience this led him to reflect more intensively on what he saw as the second nature of god the consequent nature whiteheads conception of god as a dipolar entity has called for fresh theological thinking
the primordial nature he described as the unlimited conceptual realization of the absolute wealth of potentiality ie the unlimited possibility of the universe this primordial nature is eternal and unchanging providing entities in the universe with possibilities for realization whitehead also calls this primordial aspect the lure for feeling the eternal urge of desire pulling the entities in the universe toward as-yet unrealized possibilities
gods consequent nature on the other hand is anything but unchanging – it is gods reception of the worlds activity as whitehead puts it god saves the world as it passes into the immediacy of his own life it is the judgment of a tenderness which loses nothing that can be saved in other words god saves and cherishes all experiences forever and those experiences go on to change the way god interacts with the world in this way god is really changed by what happens in the world and the wider universe lending the actions of finite creatures an eternal significance
whitehead thus sees god and the world as fulfilling one another he sees entities in the world as fluent and changing things that yearn for a permanence which only god can provide by taking them into gods self thereafter changing god and affecting the rest of the universe throughout time on the other hand he sees god as permanent but as deficient in actuality and change alone god is merely eternally unrealized possibilities and requires the world to actualize them god gives creatures permanence while the creatures give god actuality and change here it is worthwhile to quote whitehead at length

in this way god is completed by the individual fluent satisfactions of finite fact and the temporal occasions are completed by their everlasting union with their transformed selves purged into conformation with the eternal order which is the final absolute wisdom the final summary can only be expressed in terms of a group of antitheses whose apparent self-contradictions depend on neglect of the diverse categories of existence in each antithesis there is a shift of meaning which converts the opposition into a contrast
it is as true to say that god is permanent and the world fluent as that the world is permanent and god is fluent
it is as true to say that god is one and the world many as that the world is one and god many
it is as true to say that in comparison with the world god is actual eminently as that in comparison with god the world is actual eminently
it is as true to say that the world is immanent in god as that god is immanent in the world
it is as true to say that god transcends the world as that the world transcends god
it is as true to say that god creates the world as that the world creates god 
what is done in the world is transformed into a reality in heaven and the reality in heaven passes back into the world  in this sense god is the great companion – the fellow-sufferer who understands
the above is some of whiteheads most evocative writing about god and was powerful enough to inspire the movement known as process theology a vibrant theological school of thought that continues to thrive today


 religion 
for whitehead the core of religion was individual while he acknowledged that individuals cannot ever be fully separated from their society he argued that life is an internal fact for its own sake before it is an external fact relating to others his most famous remark on religion is that religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness  and if you are never solitary you are never religious whitehead saw religion as a system of general truths that transformed a persons character he took special care to note that while religion is often a good influence it is not necessarily good – an idea which he called a dangerous delusion eg a religion might encourage the violent extermination of a rival religions adherents
however while whitehead saw religion as beginning in solitariness he also saw religion as necessarily expanding beyond the individual in keeping with his process metaphysics in which relations are primary he wrote that religion necessitates the realization of the value of the objective world which is a community derivative from the interrelations of its component individuals in other words the universe is a community which makes itself whole through the relatedness of each individual entity to all the others – meaning and value do not exist for the individual alone but only in the context of the universal community whitehead writes further that each entity can find no such value till it has merged its individual claim with that of the objective universe religion is world-loyalty the spirit at once surrenders itself to this universal claim and appropriates it for itself in this way the individual and universalsocial aspects of religion are mutually dependent
whitehead also described religion more technically as an ultimate craving to infuse into the insistent particularity of emotion that non-temporal generality which primarily belongs to conceptual thought alone in other words religion takes deeply felt emotions and contextualizes them within a system of general truths about the world helping people to identify their wider meaning and significance for whitehead religion served as a kind of bridge between philosophy and the emotions and purposes of a particular society it is the task of religion to make philosophy applicable to the everyday lives of ordinary people


 influence and legacy 
isabelle stengers wrote that whiteheadians are recruited among both philosophers and theologians and the palette has been enriched by practitioners from the most diverse horizons from ecology to feminism practices that unite political struggle and spirituality with the sciences of education indeed in recent decades attention to whiteheads work has become more widespread with interest extending to intellectuals in europe and china and coming from such diverse fields as ecology physics biology education economics and psychology one of the first theologians to attempt to interact with whiteheads thought was the future archbishop of canterbury william temple in temples gifford lectures of 1932-1934 subsequently published as nature man and god whitehead is one of a number of philosophers of the emergent evolution approach temple interacts with however it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that whiteheads thought drew much attention outside of a small group of philosophers and theologians primarily americans and even today he is not considered especially influential outside of relatively specialized circles
early followers of whitehead were found primarily at the university of chicagos divinity school where henry nelson wieman initiated an interest in whiteheads work that would last for about thirty years professors such as wieman charles hartshorne bernard loomer bernard meland and daniel day williams made whiteheads philosophy arguably the most important intellectual thread running through the divinity school they taught generations of whitehead scholars the most notable of which is john b cobb jr
although interest in whitehead has since faded at chicagos divinity school cobb effectively grabbed the torch and planted it firmly in claremont california where he began teaching at claremont school of theology in 1958 and founded the center for process studies with david ray griffin in 1973 largely due to cobbs influence today claremont remains strongly identified with whiteheads process thought
but while claremont remains the most concentrated hub of whiteheadian activity the place where whiteheads thought currently seems to be growing the most quickly is in china in order to address the challenges of modernization and industrialization china has begun to blend traditions of taoism buddhism and confucianism with whiteheads constructive post-modern philosophy in order to create an ecological civilization to date the chinese government has encouraged the building of twenty-three university-based centers for the study of whiteheads philosophy and books by process philosophers john cobb and david ray griffin are becoming required reading for chinese graduate students cobb has attributed chinas interest in process philosophy partly to whiteheads stress on the mutual interdependence of humanity and nature as well as his emphasis on an educational system that includes the teaching of values rather than simply bare facts
overall however whiteheads influence is very difficult to characterize in english-speaking countries his primary works are little-studied outside of claremont and a select number of liberal graduate-level theology and philosophy programs outside of these circles his influence is relatively small and diffuse and has tended to come chiefly through the work of his students and admirers rather than whitehead himself for instance whitehead was a teacher and long-time friend and collaborator of bertrand russell and he also taught and supervised the dissertation of willard van orman quine both of whom are important figures in analytic philosophy – the dominant strain of philosophy in english-speaking countries in the 20th century whitehead has also had high-profile admirers in the continental tradition such as french post-structuralist philosopher gilles deleuze who once dryly remarked of whitehead that he stands provisionally as the last great anglo-american philosopher before wittgensteins disciples spread their misty confusion sufficiency and terror french sociologist and anthropologist bruno latour even went so far as to call whitehead the greatest philosopher of the 20th century
deleuzes and latours opinions however are minority ones as whitehead has not been recognized as particularly influential within the most dominant philosophical schools it is impossible to say exactly why whiteheads influence has not been more widespread but it may be partly due to his metaphysical ideas seeming somewhat counter-intuitive such as his assertion that matter is an abstraction or his inclusion of theistic elements in his philosophy or the perception of metaphysics itself as passé or simply the sheer difficulty and density of his prose


 process philosophy and theology 

historically whiteheads work has been most influential in the field of american progressive theology the most important early proponent of whiteheads thought in a theological context was charles hartshorne who spent a semester at harvard as whiteheads teaching assistant in 1925 and is widely credited with developing whiteheads process philosophy into a full-blown process theology other notable process theologians include john b cobb jr david ray griffin marjorie hewitt suchocki c robert mesle roland faber and catherine keller
process theology typically stresses gods relational nature rather than seeing god as impassive or emotionless process theologians view god as the fellow sufferer who understands and as the being who is supremely affected by temporal events hartshorne points out that people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers – so why would this be a praise-worthy quality in god instead as the being who is most affected by the world god is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world however process theology has been formulated in a wide variety of ways c robert mesle for instance advocates a process naturalism ie a process theology without god
in fact process theology is difficult to define because process theologians are so diverse and transdisciplinary in their views and interests john b cobb jr is a process theologian who has also written books on biology and economics roland faber and catherine keller integrate whitehead with poststructuralist postcolonialist and feminist theory charles birch was both a theologian and a geneticist franklin i gamwell writes on theology and political theory in syntheism - creating god in the internet age futurologists alexander bard and jan söderqvist repeatedly credit whitehead for the process theology they see rising out of the participatory culture expected to dominate the digital era
process philosophy is even more difficult to pin down than process theology in practice the two fields cannot be neatly separated the 32-volume state university of new york series in constructive postmodern thought edited by process philosopher and theologian david ray griffin displays the range of areas in which different process philosophers work including physics ecology medicine public policy nonviolence politics and psychology
one philosophical school which has historically had a close relationship with process philosophy is american pragmatism whitehead himself thought highly of william james and john dewey and acknowledged his indebtedness to them in the preface to process and reality charles hartshorne along with paul weiss edited the collected papers of charles sanders peirce one of the founders of pragmatism noted neopragmatist richard rorty was in turn a student of hartshorne today nicholas rescher is one example of a philosopher who advocates both process philosophy and pragmatism
in addition while they might not properly be called process philosophers whitehead has been influential in the philosophy of gilles deleuze milič čapek isabelle stengers bruno latour susanne langer and maurice merleau-ponty


 science 

scientists of the early 20th century for whom whiteheads work has been influential include physical chemist ilya prigogine biologist conrad hal waddington and geneticists charles birch and sewall wright henry murray dedicated his explorations in personality to whitehead a contemporary at harvard
in physics whiteheads theory of gravitation articulated a view that might perhaps be regarded as dual to einsteins general relativity it has been severely criticized yutaka tanaka suggested that the gravitational constant disagrees with experimental findings and proposed that einsteins work does not actually refute whiteheads formulation whiteheads view has now been rendered obsolete with the discovery of gravitational waves phenonena observed locally that largely violate the kind of local flatness of space that whitehead assumes consequently whiteheads cosmology must be regarded as a local approximation and his assumption of a uniform spatio-temporal geometry minkowskian in particular as an often-locally-adequate approximation an exact replacement of whiteheads cosmology would need to admit a riemannian geometry also although whitehead himself gave only secondary consideration to quantum theory his metaphysics of processes has proved attractive to some physicists in that field henry stapp and david bohm are among those whose work has been influenced by whitehead
in the 21 st century whiteheadian thought is still a stimulating influence timothy e eastman and hank keetons physics and whitehead 2004 and michael eppersons quantum mechanics and the philosophy of alfred north whitehead 2004 and foundations of relational realism a topological approach to quantum mechanics and the philosophy of nature 2013 aim to offer whiteheadian approaches to physics brian g henning adam scarfe and dorion sagans beyond mechanism 2013 and rupert sheldrakes science set free 2012 are examples of whiteheadian approaches to biology


 ecology economy and sustainability 

one of the most promising applications of whiteheads thought in recent years has been in the area of ecological civilization sustainability and environmental ethics
because whiteheads holistic metaphysics of value lends itself so readily to an ecological point of view many see his work as a promising alternative to the traditional mechanistic worldview providing a detailed metaphysical picture of a world constituted by a web of interdependent relations
this work has been pioneered by john b cobb jr whose book is it too late a theology of ecology 1971 was the first single-authored book in environmental ethics cobb also co-authored a book with leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist herman daly entitled for the common good redirecting the economy toward community the environment and a sustainable future 1989 which applied whiteheads thought to economics and received the grawemeyer award for ideas improving world order cobb followed this with a second book sustaining the common good a christian perspective on the global economy 1994 which aimed to challenge economists zealous faith in the great god of growth


 education 
whitehead is widely known for his influence in education theory his philosophy inspired the formation of the association for process philosophy of education appe which published eleven volumes of a journal titled process papers on process philosophy and education from 1996 to 2008 whiteheads theories on education also led to the formation of new modes of learning and new models of teaching
one such model is the anisa model developed by daniel c jordan which sought to address a lack of understanding of the nature of people in current education systems as jordan and raymond p shepard put it because it has not defined the nature of man education is in the untenable position of having to devote its energies to the development of curricula without any coherent ideas about the nature of the creature for whom they are intended
another model is the feels model developed by xie bangxiu and deployed successfully in china feels stands for five things in curriculum and education flexible-goals engaged-learner embodied-knowledge learning-through-interactions and supportive-teacher it is used for understanding and evaluating educational curriculum under the assumption that the purpose of education is to help a person become whole this work is in part the product of cooperation between chinese government organizations and the institute for the postmodern development of china
whiteheads philosophy of education has also found institutional support in canada where the university of saskatchewan created a process philosophy research unit and sponsored several conferences on process philosophy and education dr howard woodhouse at the university of saskatchewan remains a strong proponent of whiteheadian education
three recent books which further develop whiteheads philosophy of education include modes of learning whiteheads metaphysics and the stages of education 2012 by george allan and the adventure of education process philosophers on learning teaching and research 2009 by adam scarfe and educating for an ecological civilization interdisciplinary experiential and relational learning 2017 edited by marcus ford and stephen rowe beyond the modern university toward a constructive postmodern university 2002 is another text that explores the importance of whiteheads metaphysics for thinking about higher education


 business administration 
whitehead has had some influence on philosophy of business administration and organizational theory this has led in part to a focus on identifying and investigating the effect of temporal events as opposed to static things within organizations through an “organization studies” discourse that accommodates a variety of weak and strong process perspectives from a number of philosophers one of the leading figures having an explicitly whiteheadian and panexperientialist stance towards management is mark dibben who works in what he calls applied process thought to articulate a philosophy of management and business administration as part of a wider examination of the social sciences through the lens of process metaphysics for dibben this allows a comprehensive exploration of life as perpetually active experiencing as opposed to occasional – and thoroughly passive – happening dibben has published two books on applied process thought applied process thought i initial explorations in theory and research 2008 and applied process thought ii following a trail ablaze 2009 as well as other papers in this vein in the fields of philosophy of management and business ethics
margaret stout and carrie m staton have also written recently on the mutual influence of whitehead and mary parker follett a pioneer in the fields of organizational theory and organizational behavior stout and staton see both whitehead and follett as sharing an ontology that understands becoming as a relational process difference as being related yet unique and the purpose of becoming as harmonizing difference this connection is further analyzed by stout and jeannine m love in integrative process follettian thinking from ontology to administration


 political views 
whiteheads political views sometimes appear to be libertarian without the label he wrote
on the other hand many whitehead scholars read his work as providing a philosophical foundation for the social liberalism of the new liberal movement that was prominent throughout whiteheads adult life morris wrote that there is good reason for claiming that whitehead shared the social and political ideals of the new liberals
