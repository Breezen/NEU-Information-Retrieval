charles hard townes july 28 1915 – january 27 2015 was an american physicist and inventor of the maser and laser townes worked on the theory and application of the maser for which he obtained the fundamental patent and other work in quantum electronics associated with both maser and laser devices he shared the nobel prize in physics during 1964 with nikolay basov and alexander prokhorov charles was an adviser to the united states government meeting every us president from harry truman 1945 to bill clinton 1999
he directed the us government science and technology advisory committee for the apollo flights which was effective at making the program a success on schedule without exceeding its budget after becoming a professor of the university of california at berkeley during 1967 he began an astrophysical program that produced several important discoveries for example the black hole at the center of the milky way galaxy
townes was religious and believed that science and religion are converging to provide a greater understanding of the nature and purpose of the universe


 early life 
townes was born in greenville south carolina the son of henry keith townes 1876-1958 an attorney and ellen sumter townes née hard 1881-1980 he earned his bs in physics and ba in modern languages at furman university where he graduated during 1935 townes completed work for the master of arts degree in physics at duke university during 1937 and then began graduate school at the california institute of technology from which he received a phd degree during 1939 during world war ii he worked on radar bombing systems at bell labs


 career and research 

townes was appointed professor during 1950 at columbia university he served as executive director of the columbia radiation laboratory from 1950 to 1952 he was chairman of the physics department from 1952 to 1955
during 1951 he conceived a new way to create intense precise beams of coherent radiation for which he invented the acronym maser for microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation when the same principle was applied to higher frequencies the term laser was used the word light substituting for the word microwave
during 1953 townes james p gordon and h j zeiger built the first ammonia maser at columbia university this device used stimulated emission in a stream of energized ammonia molecules to produce amplification of microwaves at a frequency of about 24.0 gigahertz
from 1959 to 1961 he was on leave of absence from columbia university to serve as vice president and director of research of the institute for defense analyses in washington dc a nonprofit organization which advised the us government and was operated by eleven universities between 1961 and 1967 townes served as both provost and professor of physics at the massachusetts institute of technology then during 1967 he was appointed as a professor of physics at the university of california at berkeley where he remained for almost 50 years his status was as professor emeritus by the time of his death during 2015 between 1966 and 1970 he was chairman of the nasa science advisory committee for the apollo lunar landing program
for his creation of the maser townes along with nikolay basov and alexander prokhorov received the 1964 nobel prize in physics townes also developed the use of masers and lasers for astronomy was part of a team that first discovered complex molecules in space and determined the mass of the supermassive black hole at the centre of the milky way galaxy
during 2002–2003 townes served as a karl schwarzschild lecturer in germany and the birla lecturer and schroedinger lecturer in india


 astrophysics 
this information is drawn from the authoritative oral history on charles townes done by the bancroft library at uc berkeley and underwritten by the sloan foundation refer to other aspects of his life too


 molecular astronomy 
when charles failed to be promoted to president of mit during 1967 he accepted an offer from clark kerr to join uc berkeley and begin an astrophysical program charles soon began searching for molecules in space at the time most astronomers thought that molecules could not exist in space because uv rays would destroy them townes eventually discovered ammonia and water in dust clouds which shielded them from damaging rays by essentially doing microwave spectroscopy on the sky this created the topic of molecularmillimeter astronomy which continues to find many complex molecules some the precursors to life


 galactic center 
the center of our milky way galaxy had long puzzled astronomers and thick dust obscures our view of it in visible light during the mid to late 1970s townes together with eric wollman john lacy thomas geballe and fred baas studied sagittarius a the h ii region at the galactic center at infrared wavelengths they observed ionized neon gas swirling around the center at such velocities that the mass at the very center must be approximately equal to that of 3 million suns such a large mass in such a small space implied that the central object the radio source sagittarius a contains a supermassive black hole sgr a was one of the first black holes detected its mass is now more accurately determined to be 4.3 million solar masses


 shapes and sizes of stars 
charles most recent technological creation has been the infrared spatial interferometer isi with walt fitelson ed wishnow and others the project combines three mobile infrared detectors aligned by lasers that study the same star if each telescope is 10 meters from the other it creates an impression of a 30-meter lens isi observations of betelgeuse a red giant in the shoulder of the constellation orion found that it is increasing and decreasing in size at the rate of 1% per year 15% over 15 years isi produces extremely high angular and spatial resolution the technology is also playing an important role in the search for extraterrestrial life in collaborations with dan werthimer of seti


 personal life and legacy 
townes married frances h brown an activist for the homeless during 1941 they lived in berkeley california and had four daughters linda rosenwein ellen anderson carla kessler and holly townes
a religious man and a member of the united church of christ townes believed that science and religion are quite parallel much more similar than most people think and that in the long run they must converge he wrote in a statement after winning the templeton prize during 2005 science tries to understand what our universe is like and how it works including us humans religion is aimed at understanding the purpose and meaning of our universe including our own lives if the universe has a purpose or meaning this must be reflected in its structure and functioning and hence in science
townes died at the age of 99 in oakland california on january 27 2015 he was one of the most important experimental physicists of the last century reinhard genzel a professor of physics at berkeley said of townes his strength was his curiosity and his unshakable optimism based on his deep christian spirituality


 science and religion 
townes opinions concerning science and religion were expounded in his essays the convergence of science and religion logic and uncertainties in science and religion and his book making waves charles always felt that the beauty of nature is obviously god-made and that god created this universe for humans to emerge and flourish he prayed every day and ultimately felt that religion is more important than science because it addresses the most important long-range question the meaning and purpose of our lives charles belief in the convergence of science and religion is based on claimed similarities
faith townes argues that the scientist has faith much like a religious person does allowing himher to work for years for an uncertain result
revelation townes claims that many important scientific discoveries like his invention of the maserlaser occurred as a flash much more akin to religious revelation than interpreting data
proof during this century the mathematician godel discovered there can be no absolute proof in a scientific sense every proof requires a set of assumptions and there is no way to check if those assumptions are self-consistent because other assumptions would be required
uncertainty townes believed that we should be open-minded to a better understanding of science and religion in the future this will require us to modify our theories but not abandon them for example at the start of the 20th century physics was largely deterministic but when scientists began studying the quantum mechanics they realized that indeterminism and chance play a role in our universe both classical physics and quantum mechanics are correct and work well within their own bailiwick and continue to be taught to students similarly townes believes growth of religious understanding will modify but not make us abandon our classic religious beliefs
