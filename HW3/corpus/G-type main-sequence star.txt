a g-type main-sequence star spectral type g-v often and imprecisely called a yellow dwarf or g dwarf star is a main-sequence star luminosity class v of spectral type g such a star has about 0.84 to 1.15 solar masses and surface temperature of between 5,300 and 6,000 k tables vii viii like other main-sequence stars a g-type main-sequence star is converting the element hydrogen to helium in its core by means of nuclear fusion the sun the star to which the earth is gravitationally bound in the solar system and the object with the largest apparent magnitude is an example of a g-type main-sequence star g2v type each second the sun fuses approximately 600 million tons of hydrogen to helium converting about 4 million tons of matter to energy besides the sun other well-known examples of g-type main-sequence stars include alpha centauri a tau ceti and 51 pegasi
the term yellow dwarf is a misnomer because g-type stars actually range in color from white for more luminous types like the sun to only very slightly yellow for the less massive and luminous g-type main-sequence stars the sun is in fact white and its spectrum peaks in blue and green light but it can often appear yellow orange or red through earths atmosphere due to atmospheric rayleigh scattering especially at sunrise and sunset in addition although the term dwarf is used to contrast yellow main-sequence stars from giant stars yellow dwarfs like the sun outshine 90% of the stars in the milky way which are largely much dimmer orange dwarfs red dwarfs and white dwarfs the last being a stellar remnant
a g-type main-sequence star will fuse hydrogen for approximately 10 billion years until it is exhausted at the center of the star when this happens the star expands to many times its previous size and becomes a red giant such as aldebaran or alpha tauri eventually the red giant sheds its outer layers of gas which become a planetary nebula while the core rapidly cools and contracts into a compact dense white dwarf


 spectral standard stars 
the revised yerkes atlas system johnson  morgan 1953 listed 11 g-type dwarf spectral standard stars however not all of these have survived to this day as standards
the anchor points of the mk spectral classification system among the g-type main-sequence dwarf stars ie those standard stars that have remained unchanged over years are beta cvn g0v the sun g2v kappa1 ceti g5v 61 ursae majoris g8v other primary mk standard stars include hd 115043 g1v and 16 cygni b g3v the choices of g4 and g6 dwarf standards have changed slightly over the years among expert classifiers but often-used examples include 70 virginis g4v and 82 eridani g8v there are not yet any generally agreed upon g7v and g9v standards


 planets 
some of the nearest g-type stars known to have planets include the sun 61 virginis hd 102365 hd 147513 47 ursae majoris mu arae tau ceti and possibly alpha centauri
