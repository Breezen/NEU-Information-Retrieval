an annular solar eclipse occurred on october 3 2005 with a magnitude of 0.958 a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between earth and the sun thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the sun for a viewer on earth an annular solar eclipse occurs when the moons apparent diameter is smaller than the suns blocking most of the suns light and causing the sun to look like an annulus ring an annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the earth thousands of kilometres wide it was visible from a narrow corridor through the iberian peninsula and africa a partial eclipse was seen from the much broader path of the moons penumbra including all of europe africa and southwestern asia
the path of the eclipse began in the north atlantic ocean at 0841 universal time ut the antumbra reached madrid spain at 0856 ut lasting four minutes and eleven seconds and 90% of the sun was covered by the moon the antumbra reached algiers at 0905 ut then passed through tunisia and libya before heading southeast through sudan kenya and somalia the shadow then moved out over the indian ocean until it terminated at sunset 1222 ut
the maximum eclipse duration occurred in central sudan at 103142 ut where it lasted for 4m 31s when the sun was 71° above the horizon the theoretical maximum duration for a modern solar eclipse is 7 minutes 32 seconds
the motion of the shadow was supersonic and it generated gravity waves that were detectable as disturbances in the ionosphere these gravity waves originate in the thermosphere at an altitude of about 180 km because of the obscuration of solar radiation the ionization level dropped by 70% during the eclipse the eclipse caused a 1–1.4 k drop in the temperature of the ionosphere
