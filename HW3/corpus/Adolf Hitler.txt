adolf hitler german ˈadɔlf ˈhɪtlɐ  listen 20 april 1889 – 30 april 1945 was a german politician who was the leader of the nazi party nationalsozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei nsdap chancellor of germany from 1933 to 1945 and führer leader of nazi germany from 1934 to 1945 as dictator hitler initiated world war ii in europe with the invasion of poland in september 1939 and was central to the holocaust
hitler was born in austria—then part of austria-hungary—and was raised near linz he moved to germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the german army in world war i in 1919 he joined the german workers party dap the precursor of the nsdap and was appointed leader of the nsdap in 1921 in 1923 he attempted to seize power in a failed coup in munich and was imprisoned while in jail he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto mein kampf my struggle after his release from prison in 1924 hitler gained popular support by attacking the treaty of versailles and promoting pan-germanism anti-semitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and nazi propaganda he frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a jewish conspiracy
by 1933 the nazi party was the largest elected party in the german reichstag but did not have a majority and no party was able to form a majority parliamentary coalition in support of a candidate for chancellor this led to former chancellor franz von papen and other conservative leaders persuading president paul von hindenburg to appoint hitler as chancellor on 30 january 1933 shortly after the reichstag passed the enabling act of 1933 which began the process of transforming the weimar republic into nazi germany a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of national socialism hitler aimed to eliminate jews from germany and establish a new order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-world war i international order dominated by britain and france his first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the great depression the abrogation of restrictions imposed on germany after world war i and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic germans which gave him significant popular support
hitler sought lebensraum living space for the german people in eastern europe and his aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of world war ii in europe he directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 september 1939 invaded poland resulting in britain and france declaring war on germany in june 1941 hitler ordered an invasion of the soviet union by the end of 1941 german forces and the european axis powers occupied most of europe and north africa in december 1941 he formally declared war on the united states bringing them directly into the conflict failure to defeat the soviets and the entry of the united states into the war forced germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats in the final days of the war during the battle of berlin in 1945 he married his long-time lover eva braun less than two days later on 30 april 1945 the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the soviet red army and their corpses were burned
under hitlers leadership and racially motivated ideology the nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million jews and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed untermenschen sub-humans or socially undesirable hitler and the nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war in addition 29 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the european theatre the number of civilians killed during the second world war was unprecedented in warfare and the casualties constituted the deadliest conflict in human history


 early years 


 ancestry 

hitlers father alois hitler sr 1837–1903 was the illegitimate child of maria anna schicklgruber the baptismal register did not show the name of his father and alois initially bore his mothers surname schicklgruber in 1842 johann georg hiedler married aloiss mother maria anna alois was brought up in the family of hiedlers brother johann nepomuk hiedler in 1876 alois was legitimated and the baptismal register changed by a priest to register johann georg hiedler as aloiss father recorded as georg hitler alois then assumed the surname hitler also spelled hiedler hüttler or huettler the hitler surname is probably based on one who lives in a hut german hütte for hut
nazi official hans frank suggested that aloiss mother had been employed as a housekeeper by a jewish family in graz and that the familys 19-year-old son leopold frankenberger had fathered alois no frankenberger was registered in graz during that period and no record has been produced of leopold frankenbergers existence so historians dismiss the claim that aloiss father was jewish


 childhood and education 

adolf hitler was born on 20 april 1889 in braunau am inn a town in austria-hungary in present-day austria close to the border with the german empire he was christened as adolphus hitler he was the fourth of six children born to alois hitler and his third wife klara pölzl three of hitlers siblings—gustav ida and otto—died in infancy also living in the household were aloiss children from his second marriage alois jr born 1882 and angela born 1883 when hitler was three the family moved to passau germany there he acquired the distinctive lower bavarian dialect rather than austrian german which marked his speech throughout his life the family returned to austria and settled in leonding in 1894 and in june 1895 alois retired to hafeld near lambach where he farmed and kept bees hitler attended volksschule a state-owned school in nearby fischlham
the move to hafeld coincided with the onset of intense father-son conflicts caused by hitlers refusal to conform to the strict discipline of his school alois hitlers farming efforts at hafeld ended in failure and in 1897 the family moved to lambach the eight-year-old hitler took singing lessons sang in the church choir and even considered becoming a priest in 1898 the family returned permanently to leonding hitler was deeply affected by the death of his younger brother edmund who died in 1900 from measles hitler changed from a confident outgoing conscientious student to a morose detached boy who constantly fought with his father and teachers

alois had made a successful career in the customs bureau and wanted his son to follow in his footsteps hitler later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office depicting it as an event that gave rise to an unforgiving antagonism between father and son who were both strong-willed ignoring his sons desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist alois sent hitler to the realschule in linz in september 1900 hitler rebelled against this decision and in mein kampf states that he intentionally did poorly in school hoping that once his father saw what little progress i was making at the technical school he would let me devote myself to my dream
like many austrian germans hitler began to develop german nationalist ideas from a young age he expressed loyalty only to germany despising the declining habsburg monarchy and its rule over an ethnically variegated empire hitler and his friends used the greeting heil and sang the deutschlandlied instead of the austrian imperial anthem
after aloiss sudden death on 3 january 1903 hitlers performance at school deteriorated and his mother allowed him to leave he enrolled at the realschule in steyr in september 1904 where his behaviour and performance improved in 1905 after passing a repeat of the final exam hitler left the school without any ambitions for further education or clear plans for a career


 early adulthood in vienna and munich 

in 1907 hitler left linz to live and study fine art in vienna financed by orphans benefits and support from his mother he applied for admission to the academy of fine arts vienna but was rejected twice the director explained his drawings showed unfitness for painting and suggested hitler was better suited to studying architecture though this was an interest of his he lacked the academic credentials as he had not finished secondary school on 21 december 1907 his mother died of breast cancer at the age of 47 in 1909 hitler ran out of money and was forced to live a bohemian life in homeless shelters and a mens hostel he earned money as a casual labourer and by painting and selling watercolours of viennas sights

during his time in vienna he pursued a growing passion for two interests architecture and music attending ten performances of lohengrin his favorite wagner opera
it was here that hitler first became exposed to racist rhetoric populists such as mayor karl lueger exploited the climate of virulent anti-semitism and occasionally espoused german nationalist notions for political effect german nationalism had a particularly widespread following in the mariahilf district where hitler lived georg ritter von schönerer became a major influence on hitler he also developed an admiration for martin luther hitler read local newspapers such as deutsches volksblatt that fanned prejudice and played on christian fears of being swamped by an influx of eastern european jews he read newspapers and pamphlets that published the thoughts of philosophers and theoreticians such as houston stewart chamberlain charles darwin friedrich nietzsche gustave le bon and arthur schopenhauer
the origin and development of hitlers anti-semitism remains a matter of debate his friend august kubizek claimed that hitler was a confirmed anti-semite before he left linz however historian brigitte hamann describes kubizeks claim as problematical while hitler states in mein kampf that he first became an anti-semite in vienna reinhold hanisch who helped him sell his paintings disagrees hitler had dealings with jews while living in vienna historian richard j evans states that historians now generally agree that his notorious murderous anti-semitism emerged well after germanys defeat in world war i as a product of the paranoid stab-in-the-back explanation for the catastrophe
hitler received the final part of his fathers estate in may 1913 and moved to munich germany hitler was called up for conscription into the austro-hungarian army so he journeyed to salzburg on 5 february 1914 for medical assessment after he was deemed by the medical examiners as unfit for service he returned to munich hitler later claimed that he did not wish to serve the habsburg empire because of the mixture of races in its army and his belief that the collapse of austria-hungary was imminent


 world war i 

in august 1914 at the outbreak of world war i hitler was living in munich and voluntarily enlisted in the bavarian army according to a 1924 report by the bavarian authorities allowing hitler to serve was almost certainly an administrative error since as an austrian citizen he should have been returned to austria posted to the bavarian reserve infantry regiment 16 1st company of the list regiment he served as a dispatch runner on the western front in france and belgium spending nearly half his time at the regimental headquarters in fournes-en-weppes well behind the front lines he was present at the first battle of ypres the battle of the somme the battle of arras and the battle of passchendaele and was wounded at the somme he was decorated for bravery receiving the iron cross second class in 1914 on a recommendation by lieutenant hugo gutmann hitlers jewish superior he received the iron cross first class on 4 august 1918 a decoration rarely awarded to one of hitlers gefreiter rank he received the black wound badge on 18 may 1918

during his service at headquarters hitler pursued his artwork drawing cartoons and instructions for an army newspaper during the battle of the somme in october 1916 he was wounded in the left thigh when a shell exploded in the dispatch runners dugout hitler spent almost two months in hospital at beelitz returning to his regiment on 5 march 1917 on 15 october 1918 he was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack and was hospitalised in pasewalk while there hitler learned of germanys defeat and—by his own account—upon receiving this news he suffered a second bout of blindness
hitler described the war as the greatest of all experiences and was praised by his commanding officers for his bravery his wartime experience reinforced his german patriotism and he was shocked by germanys capitulation in november 1918 his bitterness over the collapse of the war effort began to shape his ideology like other german nationalists he believed the dolchstosslegende stab-in-the-back myth which claimed that the german army undefeated in the field had been stabbed in the back on the home front by civilian leaders jews and marxists later dubbed the november criminals
the treaty of versailles stipulated that germany must relinquish several of its territories and demilitarise the rhineland the treaty imposed economic sanctions and levied heavy reparations on the country many germans saw the treaty as an unjust humiliation—they especially objected to article 231 which they interpreted as declaring germany responsible for the war the versailles treaty and the economic social and political conditions in germany after the war were later exploited by hitler for political gain


 entry into politics 

after world war i hitler returned to munich without formal education or career prospects he remained in the army in july 1919 he was appointed verbindungsmann intelligence agent of an aufklärungskommando reconnaissance unit of the reichswehr assigned to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the german workers party dap at a dap meeting on 12 september 1919 party chairman anton drexler was impressed with hitlers oratorical skills he gave him a copy of his pamphlet my political awakening which contained anti-semitic nationalist anti-capitalist and anti-marxist ideas on the orders of his army superiors hitler applied to join the party and within a week was accepted as party member 555 the party began counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much larger party
around this time hitler made his earliest known recorded statement about the jews in a letter now known as the gemlich letter dated 16 september 1919 to adolf gemlich about the jewish question in the letter hitler argues that the aim of the government must unshakably be the removal of the jews altogether
at the dap hitler met dietrich eckart one of the partys founders and a member of the occult thule society eckart became hitlers mentor exchanging ideas with him and introducing him to a wide range of munich society to increase its appeal the dap changed its name to the nationalsozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei national socialist german workers party nsdap hitler designed the partys banner of a swastika in a white circle on a red background
hitler was discharged from the army on 31 march 1920 and began working full-time for the nsdap the party headquarters was in munich a hotbed of anti-government german nationalists determined to crush marxism and undermine the weimar republic in february 1921—already highly effective at crowd manipulation—he spoke to a crowd of over 6,000 to publicise the meeting two truckloads of party supporters drove around munich waving swastika flags and distributing leaflets hitler soon gained notoriety for his rowdy polemic speeches against the treaty of versailles rival politicians and especially against marxists and jews

in june 1921 while hitler and eckart were on a fundraising trip to berlin a mutiny broke out within the nsdap in munich members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival german socialist party dsp hitler returned to munich on 11 july and angrily tendered his resignation the committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace drexler as party chairman and that the party headquarters would remain in munich the committee agreed and he rejoined the party on 26 july as member 3,680 hitler continued to face some opposition within the nsdap opponents of hitler in the leadership had hermann esser expelled from the party and they printed 3,000 copies of a pamphlet attacking hitler as a traitor to the party in the following days hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself and esser to thunderous applause his strategy proved successful and at a special party congress on 29 july he was granted absolute powers as party chairman replacing drexler by a vote of 533 to 1
hitlers vitriolic beer hall speeches began attracting regular audiences he became adept at using populist themes including the use of scapegoats who were blamed for his listeners economic hardships hitler used personal magnetism and an understanding of crowd psychology to his advantage while engaged in public speaking historians have noted the hypnotic effect of his rhetoric on large audiences and of his eyes in small groups algis budrys recalled the crowd noise and behavior when hitler appeared in a 1936 parade some in the audience writhed and rolled on the ground or experienced fecal incontinence alfons heck a former member of the hitler youth recalled a similar experience

we erupted into a frenzy of nationalistic pride that bordered on hysteria for minutes on end we shouted at the top of our lungs with tears streaming down our faces sieg heil sieg heil sieg heil from that moment on i belonged to adolf hitler body and soul

early followers included rudolf hess former air force ace hermann göring and army captain ernst röhm röhm became head of the nazis paramilitary organisation the sturmabteilung sa stormtroopers which protected meetings and attacked political opponents a critical influence on hitlers thinking during this period was the aufbau vereinigung a conspiratorial group of white russian exiles and early national socialists the group financed with funds channelled from wealthy industrialists introduced hitler to the idea of a jewish conspiracy linking international finance with bolshevism


 beer hall putsch and landsberg prison 

in 1923 hitler enlisted the help of world war i general erich ludendorff for an attempted coup known as the beer hall putsch the nsdap used italian fascism as a model for their appearance and policies hitler wanted to emulate benito mussolinis march on rome of 1922 by staging his own coup in bavaria to be followed by a challenge to the government in berlin hitler and ludendorff sought the support of staatskommissar state commissioner gustav ritter von kahr bavarias de facto ruler however kahr along with police chief hans ritter von seisser and reichswehr general otto von lossow wanted to install a nationalist dictatorship without hitler
on 8 november 1923 hitler and the sa stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people organised by kahr in the bürgerbräukeller a beer hall in munich interrupting kahrs speech he announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government with ludendorff retiring to a back room hitler with handgun drawn demanded and got the support of kahr seisser and lossow hitlers forces initially succeeded in occupying the local reichswehr and police headquarters but kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support neither the army nor the state police joined forces with hitler the next day hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the bavarian war ministry to overthrow the bavarian government but police dispersed them sixteen nsdap members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup

hitler fled to the home of ernst hanfstaengl and by some accounts contemplated suicide he was depressed but calm when arrested on 11 november 1923 for high treason his trial before the special peoples court in munich began in february 1924 and alfred rosenberg became temporary leader of the nsdap on 1 april hitler was sentenced to five years imprisonment at landsberg prison there he received friendly treatment from the guards and was allowed mail from supporters and regular visits by party comrades pardoned by the bavarian supreme court he was released from jail on 20 december 1924 against the state prosecutors objections including time on remand hitler served just over one year in prison
while at landsberg hitler dictated most of the first volume of mein kampf my struggle originally entitled four and a half years of struggle against lies stupidity and cowardice to his deputy rudolf hess the book dedicated to thule society member dietrich eckart was an autobiography and exposition of his ideology the book laid out hitlers plans for transforming german society into one based on race some passages imply genocide published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926 it sold 228,000 copies between 1925 and 1932 one million copies were sold in 1933 hitlers first year in office
shortly before hitler was eligible for parole the bavarian government attempted to have him deported back to austria the austrian federal chancellor rejected the request on the specious grounds that his service in the german army made his austrian citizenship void in response hitler formally renounced his austrian citizenship on 7 april 1925


 rebuilding the nsdap 
at the time of hitlers release from prison politics in germany had become less combative and the economy had improved limiting hitlers opportunities for political agitation as a result of the failed beer hall putsch the nsdap and its affiliated organisations were banned in bavaria in a meeting with the prime minister of bavaria heinrich held on 4 january 1925 hitler agreed to respect the states authority and promised that he would seek political power only through the democratic process the meeting paved the way for the ban on the nsdap to be lifted on 16 february however after an inflammatory speech he gave on 27 february hitler was barred from public speaking by the bavarian authorities a ban that remained in place until 1927 to advance his political ambitions in spite of the ban hitler appointed gregor strasser otto strasser and joseph goebbels to organise and grow the nsdap in northern germany gregor strasser steered a more independent political course emphasising the socialist elements of the partys programme
the stock market in the united states crashed on 24 october 1929 the impact in germany was dire millions were thrown out of work and several major banks collapsed hitler and the nsdap prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for their party they promised to repudiate the versailles treaty strengthen the economy and provide jobs


 rise to power 


 brüning administration 
the great depression provided a political opportunity for hitler germans were ambivalent about the parliamentary republic which faced challenges from right- and left-wing extremists the moderate political parties were increasingly unable to stem the tide of extremism and the german referendum of 1929 helped to elevate nazi ideology the elections of september 1930 resulted in the break-up of a grand coalition and its replacement with a minority cabinet its leader chancellor heinrich brüning of the centre party governed through emergency decrees from president paul von hindenburg governance by decree became the new norm and paved the way for authoritarian forms of government the nsdap rose from obscurity to win 18.3 per cent of the vote and 107 parliamentary seats in the 1930 election becoming the second-largest party in parliament

hitler made a prominent appearance at the trial of two reichswehr officers lieutenants richard scheringer and hans ludin in late 1930 both were charged with membership in the nsdap at that time illegal for reichswehr personnel the prosecution argued that the nsdap was an extremist party prompting defence lawyer hans frank to call on hitler to testify on 25 september 1930 hitler testified that his party would pursue political power solely through democratic elections which won him many supporters in the officer corps
brünings austerity measures brought little economic improvement and were extremely unpopular hitler exploited this by targeting his political messages specifically at people who had been affected by the inflation of the 1920s and the depression such as farmers war veterans and the middle class
although hitler had terminated his austrian citizenship in 1925 he did not acquire german citizenship for almost seven years this meant that he was stateless legally unable to run for public office and still faced the risk of deportation on 25 february 1932 the interior minister of brunswick dietrich klagges who was a member of the nsdap appointed hitler as administrator for the states delegation to the reichsrat in berlin making hitler a citizen of brunswick and thus of germany
hitler ran against hindenburg in the 1932 presidential elections a 27 january 1932 speech to the industry club in düsseldorf won him support from many of germanys most powerful industrialists hindenburg had support from various nationalist monarchist catholic and republican parties and some social democrats hitler used the campaign slogan hitler über deutschland hitler over germany a reference to his political ambitions and his campaigning by aircraft he was one of the first politicians to use aircraft travel for political purposes and used it effectively hitler came in second in both rounds of the election garnering more than 35 per cent of the vote in the final election although he lost to hindenburg this election established hitler as a strong force in german politics


 appointment as chancellor 

the absence of an effective government prompted two influential politicians franz von papen and alfred hugenberg along with several other industrialists and businessmen to write a letter to hindenburg the signers urged hindenburg to appoint hitler as leader of a government independent from parliamentary parties which could turn into a movement that would enrapture millions of people
hindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint hitler as chancellor after two further parliamentary elections—in july and november 1932—had not resulted in the formation of a majority government hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the nsdap and hugenbergs party the german national peoples party dnvp on 30 january 1933 the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in hindenburgs office the nsdap gained three posts hitler was named chancellor wilhelm frick minister of the interior and hermann göring minister of the interior for prussia hitler had insisted on the ministerial positions as a way to gain control over the police in much of germany


 reichstag fire and march elections 
as chancellor hitler worked against attempts by the nsdaps opponents to build a majority government because of the political stalemate he asked hindenburg to again dissolve the reichstag and elections were scheduled for early march on 27 february 1933 the reichstag building was set on fire göring blamed a communist plot because dutch communist marinus van der lubbe was found in incriminating circumstances inside the burning building according to kershaw the consensus of nearly all historians is that van der lubbe actually set the fire others including william l shirer and alan bullock are of the opinion that the nsdap itself was responsible at hitlers urging hindenburg responded with the reichstag fire decree of 28 february which suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial the decree was permitted under article 48 of the weimar constitution which gave the president the power to take emergency measures to protect public safety and order activities of the german communist party kpd were suppressed and some 4,000 kpd members were arrested
in addition to political campaigning the nsdap engaged in paramilitary violence and the spread of anti-communist propaganda in the days preceding the election on election day 6 march 1933 the nsdaps share of the vote increased to 43.9 per cent and the party acquired the largest number of seats in parliament hitlers party failed to secure an absolute majority necessitating another coalition with the dnvp


 day of potsdam and the enabling act 

on 21 march 1933 the new reichstag was constituted with an opening ceremony at the garrison church in potsdam this day of potsdam was held to demonstrate unity between the nazi movement and the old prussian elite and military hitler appeared in a morning coat and humbly greeted hindenburg
to achieve full political control despite not having an absolute majority in parliament hitlers government brought the ermächtigungsgesetz enabling act to a vote in the newly elected reichstag the act—officially titled the gesetz zur behebung der not von volk und reich law to remedy the distress of people and reich—gave hitlers cabinet the power to enact laws without the consent of the reichstag for four years these laws could with certain exceptions deviate from the constitution since it would affect the constitution the enabling act required a two-thirds majority to pass leaving nothing to chance the nazis used the provisions of the reichstag fire decree to arrest all 81 communist deputies in spite of their virulent campaign against the party the nazis had allowed the kpd to contest the election and prevent several social democrats from attending
on 23 march 1933 the reichstag assembled at the kroll opera house under turbulent circumstances ranks of sa men served as guards inside the building while large groups outside opposing the proposed legislation shouted slogans and threats towards the arriving members of parliament the position of the centre party the third largest party in the reichstag was decisive after hitler verbally promised party leader ludwig kaas that hindenburg would retain his power of veto kaas announced the centre party would support the enabling act the act passed by a vote of 441–84 with all parties except the social democrats voting in favour the enabling act along with the reichstag fire decree transformed hitlers government into a de facto legal dictatorship


 dictatorship 

at the risk of appearing to talk nonsense i tell you that the national socialist movement will go on for 1,000 years  dont forget how people laughed at me 15 years ago when i declared that one day i would govern germany they laugh now just as foolishly when i declare that i shall remain in power

having achieved full control over the legislative and executive branches of government hitler and his allies began to suppress the remaining opposition the social democratic party was banned and its assets seized while many trade union delegates were in berlin for may day activities sa stormtroopers demolished union offices around the country on 2 may 1933 all trade unions were forced to dissolve and their leaders were arrested some were sent to concentration camps the german labour front was formed as an umbrella organisation to represent all workers administrators and company owners thus reflecting the concept of national socialism in the spirit of hitlers volksgemeinschaft peoples community

by the end of june the other parties had been intimidated into disbanding this included the nazis nominal coalition partner the dnvp with the sas help hitler forced its leader hugenberg to resign on 29 june on 14 july 1933 the nsdap was declared the only legal political party in germany the demands of the sa for more political and military power caused anxiety among military industrial and political leaders in response hitler purged the entire sa leadership in the night of the long knives which took place from 30 june to 2 july 1934 hitler targeted ernst röhm and other sa leaders who along with a number of hitlers political adversaries such as gregor strasser and former chancellor kurt von schleicher were rounded up arrested and shot while the international community and some germans were shocked by the murders many in germany believed hitler was restoring order
on 2 august 1934 hindenburg died the previous day the cabinet had enacted the law concerning the highest state office of the reich this law stated that upon hindenburgs death the office of president would be abolished and its powers merged with those of the chancellor hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government and was formally named as führer und reichskanzler leader and chancellor with this action hitler eliminated the last legal remedy by which he could be removed from office
as head of state hitler became supreme commander of the armed forces immediately after hindenbergs death at the instigation of the leadership of the reichswehr the traditional loyalty oath of soldiers was altered to affirm loyalty to hitler personally by name rather than to the office of supreme commander or the state on 19 august the merger of the presidency with the chancellorship was approved by 88 per cent of the electorate voting in a plebiscite

in early 1938 hitler used blackmail to consolidate his hold over the military by instigating the blomberg–fritsch affair hitler forced his war minister field marshal werner von blomberg to resign by using a police dossier that showed that blombergs new wife had a record for prostitution army commander colonel-general werner von fritsch was removed after the schutzstaffel ss produced allegations that he had engaged in a homosexual relationship both men had fallen into disfavour because they objected to hitlers demand to make the wehrmacht ready for war as early as 1938 hitler assumed blombergs title of commander-in-chief thus taking personal command of the armed forces he replaced the ministry of war with the oberkommando der wehrmacht armed forces high command okw headed by general wilhelm keitel on the same day sixteen generals were stripped of their commands and 44 more were transferred all were suspected of not being sufficiently pro-nazi by early february 1938 twelve more generals had been removed
hitler took care to give his dictatorship the appearance of legality many of his decrees were explicitly based on the reichstag fire decree and hence on article 48 of the weimar constitution the reichstag renewed the enabling act twice each time for a four-year period while elections to the reichstag were still held in 1933 1936 and 1938 voters were presented with a single list of nazis and pro-nazi guests which carried with well over 90 percent of the vote these elections were held in far-from-secret conditions the nazis threatened severe reprisals against anyone who didnt vote or dared to vote no


 nazi germany 


 economy and culture 

in august 1934 hitler appointed reichsbank president hjalmar schacht as minister of economics and in the following year as plenipotentiary for war economy in charge of preparing the economy for war reconstruction and rearmament were financed through mefo bills printing money and seizing the assets of people arrested as enemies of the state including jews unemployment fell from six million in 1932 to one million in 1936 hitler oversaw one of the largest infrastructure improvement campaigns in german history leading to the construction of dams autobahns railroads and other civil works wages were slightly lower in the mid to late 1930s compared with wages during the weimar republic while the cost of living increased by 25 per cent the average work week increased during the shift to a war economy by 1939 the average german was working between 47 and 50 hours a week
hitlers government sponsored architecture on an immense scale albert speer instrumental in implementing hitlers classicist reinterpretation of german culture was placed in charge of the proposed architectural renovations of berlin despite a threatened multi-nation boycott germany hosted the 1936 olympic games hitler officiated at the opening ceremonies and attended events at both the winter games in garmisch-partenkirchen and the summer games in berlin


 rearmament and new alliances 

in a meeting with german military leaders on 3 february 1933 hitler spoke of conquest for lebensraum in the east and its ruthless germanisation as his ultimate foreign policy objectives in march prince bernhard wilhelm von bülow secretary at the auswärtiges amt foreign office issued a statement of major foreign policy aims anschluss with austria the restoration of germanys national borders of 1914 rejection of military restrictions under the treaty of versailles the return of the former german colonies in africa and a german zone of influence in eastern europe hitler found bülows goals to be too modest in speeches during this period he stressed the peaceful goals of his policies and a willingness to work within international agreements at the first meeting of his cabinet in 1933 hitler prioritised military spending over unemployment relief

germany withdrew from the league of nations and the world disarmament conference in october 1933 in january 1935 over 90 per cent of the people of the saarland then under league of nations administration voted to unite with germany that march hitler announced an expansion of the wehrmacht to 600,000 members—six times the number permitted by the versailles treaty—including development of an air force luftwaffe and an increase in the size of the navy kriegsmarine britain france italy and the league of nations condemned these violations of the treaty but did nothing to stop it the anglo-german naval agreement agna of 18 june allowed german tonnage to increase to 35 per cent of that of the british navy hitler called the signing of the agna the happiest day of his life believing that the agreement marked the beginning of the anglo-german alliance he had predicted in mein kampf france and italy were not consulted before the signing directly undermining the league of nations and setting the treaty of versailles on the path towards irrelevance
germany reoccupied the demilitarised zone in the rhineland in march 1936 in violation of the versailles treaty hitler also sent troops to spain to support general franco during the spanish civil war after receiving an appeal for help in july 1936 at the same time hitler continued his efforts to create an anglo-german alliance in august 1936 in response to a growing economic crisis caused by his rearmament efforts hitler ordered göring to implement a four year plan to prepare germany for war within the next four years the plan envisaged an all-out struggle between judeo-bolshevism and german national socialism which in hitlers view required a committed effort of rearmament regardless of the economic costs
count galeazzo ciano foreign minister of mussolinis government declared an axis between germany and italy and on 25 november germany signed the anti-comintern pact with japan britain china italy and poland were also invited to join the anti-comintern pact but only italy signed in 1937 hitler abandoned his plan of an anglo-german alliance blaming inadequate british leadership at a meeting in the reich chancellery with his foreign ministers and military chiefs that november hitler restated his intention of acquiring lebensraum for the german people he ordered preparations for war in the east to begin as early as 1938 and no later than 1943 in the event of his death the conference minutes recorded as the hossbach memorandum were to be regarded as his political testament he felt that a severe decline in living standards in germany as a result of the economic crisis could only be stopped by military aggression aimed at seizing austria and czechoslovakia hitler urged quick action before britain and france gained a permanent lead in the arms race in early 1938 in the wake of the blomberg–fritsch affair hitler asserted control of the military-foreign policy apparatus dismissing neurath as foreign minister and appointing himself as war minister from early 1938 onwards hitler was carrying out a foreign policy ultimately aimed at war


 world war ii 


 early diplomatic successes 


 alliance with japan 

in february 1938 on the advice of his newly appointed foreign minister the strongly pro-japanese joachim von ribbentrop hitler ended the sino-german alliance with the republic of china to instead enter into an alliance with the more modern and powerful empire of japan hitler announced german recognition of manchukuo the japanese-occupied state in manchuria and renounced german claims to their former colonies in the pacific held by japan hitler ordered an end to arms shipments to china and recalled all german officers working with the chinese army in retaliation chinese general chiang kai-shek cancelled all sino-german economic agreements depriving the germans of many chinese raw materials


 austria and czechoslovakia 
on 12 march 1938 hitler announced the unification of austria with nazi germany in the anschluss hitler then turned his attention to the ethnic german population of the sudetenland region of czechoslovakia
on 28–29 march 1938 hitler held a series of secret meetings in berlin with konrad henlein of the sudeten german party the largest of the ethnic german parties of the sudetenland the men agreed that henlein would demand increased autonomy for sudeten germans from the czechoslovakian government thus providing a pretext for german military action against czechoslovakia in april 1938 henlein told the foreign minister of hungary that whatever the czech government might offer he would always raise still higher demands  he wanted to sabotage an understanding by any means because this was the only method to blow up czechoslovakia quickly in private hitler considered the sudeten issue unimportant his real intention was a war of conquest against czechoslovakia

in april hitler ordered the okw to prepare for fall grün case green the code name for an invasion of czechoslovakia as a result of intense french and british diplomatic pressure on 5 september czechoslovakian president edvard beneš unveiled the fourth plan for constitutional reorganisation of his country which agreed to most of henleins demands for sudeten autonomy henleins party responded to beneš offer by instigating a series of violent clashes with the czechoslovakian police that led to the declaration of martial law in certain sudeten districts
germany was dependent on imported oil a confrontation with britain over the czechoslovakian dispute could curtail germanys oil supplies this forced hitler to call off fall grün originally planned for 1 october 1938 on 29 september hitler neville chamberlain édouard daladier and mussolini attended a one-day conference in munich that led to the munich agreement which handed over the sudetenland districts to germany
chamberlain was satisfied with the munich conference calling the outcome peace for our time while hitler was angered about the missed opportunity for war in 1938 he expressed his disappointment in a speech on 9 october in saarbrücken in hitlers view the british-brokered peace although favourable to the ostensible german demands was a diplomatic defeat which spurred his intent of limiting british power to pave the way for the eastern expansion of germany as a result of the summit hitler was selected time magazines man of the year for 1938
in late 1938 and early 1939 the continuing economic crisis caused by rearmament forced hitler to make major defence cuts in his export or die speech of 30 january 1939 he called for an economic offensive to increase german foreign exchange holdings to pay for raw materials such as high-grade iron needed for military weapons
on 15 march 1939 in violation of the munich accord and possibly as a result of the deepening economic crisis requiring additional assets hitler ordered the wehrmacht to invade prague and from prague castle he proclaimed bohemia and moravia a german protectorate


 start of world war ii 

in private discussions in 1939 hitler declared britain the main enemy to be defeated and that polands obliteration was a necessary prelude for that goal the eastern flank would be secured and land would be added to germanys lebensraum offended by the british guarantee on 31 march 1939 of polish independence he said i shall brew them a devils drink in a speech in wilhelmshaven for the launch of the battleship tirpitz on 1 april he threatened to denounce the anglo-german naval agreement if the british continued to guarantee polish independence which he perceived as an encirclement policy poland was to either become a german satellite state or it would be neutralised in order to secure the reichs eastern flank and prevent a possible british blockade hitler initially favoured the idea of a satellite state but upon its rejection by the polish government he decided to invade and made this the main foreign policy goal of 1939 on 3 april hitler ordered the military to prepare for fall weiss case white the plan for invading poland on 25 august in a reichstag speech on 28 april he renounced both the anglo-german naval agreement and the german–polish non-aggression pact historians such as william carr gerhard weinberg and ian kershaw have argued that one reason for hitlers rush to war was his fear of an early death he had repeatedly claimed that he must lead germany into war before he got too old as his successors might lack his strength of will

hitler was concerned that a military attack against poland could result in a premature war with britain hitlers foreign minister and former ambassador to london joachim von ribbentrop assured him that neither britain nor france would honour their commitments to poland accordingly on 22 august 1939 hitler ordered a military mobilisation against poland
this plan required tacit soviet support and the non-aggression pact the molotov–ribbentrop pact between germany and the soviet union led by joseph stalin included a secret agreement to partition poland between the two countries contrary to ribbentrops prediction that britain would sever anglo-polish ties britain and poland signed the anglo-polish alliance on 25 august 1939 this along with news from italy that mussolini would not honour the pact of steel prompted hitler to postpone the attack on poland from 25 august to 1 september hitler unsuccessfully tried to manoeuvre the british into neutrality by offering them a non-aggression guarantee on 25 august he then instructed ribbentrop to present a last-minute peace plan with an impossibly short time limit in an effort to blame the imminent war on british and polish inaction
on 1 september 1939 germany invaded western poland under the pretext of having been denied claims to the free city of danzig and the right to extraterritorial roads across the polish corridor which germany had ceded under the versailles treaty in response britain and france declared war on germany on 3 september surprising hitler and prompting him to angrily ask ribbentrop now what france and britain did not act on their declarations immediately and on 17 september soviet forces invaded eastern poland

the fall of poland was followed by what contemporary journalists dubbed the phoney war or sitzkrieg sitting war hitler instructed the two newly appointed gauleiters of north-western poland albert forster of reichsgau danzig-west prussia and arthur greiser of reichsgau wartheland to germanise their areas with no questions asked about how this was accomplished in forsters area ethnic poles merely had to sign forms stating that they had german blood in contrast greiser agreed with himmler and carried out an ethnic cleansing campaign towards poles greiser soon complained that forster was allowing thousands of poles to be accepted as racial germans and thus endangered german racial purity hitler refrained from getting involved this inaction has been advanced as an example of the theory of working towards the führer in which hitler issued vague instructions and expected his subordinates to work out policies on their own
another dispute pitched one side represented by heinrich himmler and greiser who championed ethnic cleansing in poland against another represented by göring and hans frank governor-general of occupied poland who called for turning poland into the granary of the reich on 12 february 1940 the dispute was initially settled in favour of the göring–frank view which ended the economically disruptive mass expulsions on 15 may 1940 himmler issued a memo entitled some thoughts on the treatment of alien population in the east calling for the expulsion of the entire jewish population of europe into africa and the reduction of the polish population to a leaderless class of labourers hitler called himmlers memo good and correct and ignoring göring and frank implemented the himmler–greiser policy in poland

on 9 april german forces invaded denmark and norway on the same day hitler proclaimed the birth of the greater germanic reich his vision of a united empire of germanic nations of europe in which the dutch flemish and scandinavians were joined into a racially pure polity under german leadership in may 1940 germany attacked france and conquered luxembourg the netherlands and belgium these victories prompted mussolini to have italy join forces with hitler on 10 june france and germany signed an armistice on 22 june kershaw notes that hitlers popularity within germany – and german support for the war – reached its peak when he returned to berlin on 6 july from his tour of paris following the unexpected swift victory hitler promoted twelve generals to the rank of field marshal during the 1940 field marshal ceremony

britain whose troops were forced to evacuate france by sea from dunkirk continued to fight alongside other british dominions in the battle of the atlantic hitler made peace overtures to the new british leader winston churchill and upon their rejection he ordered a series of aerial attacks on royal air force airbases and radar stations in south-east england on 7 september the systematic nightly bombing of london began the german luftwaffe failed to defeat the royal air force in what became known as the battle of britain by the end of september hitler realised that air superiority for the invasion of britain in operation sea lion could not be achieved and ordered the operation postponed the nightly air raids on british cities intensified and continued for months including london plymouth and coventry
on 27 september 1940 the tripartite pact was signed in berlin by saburō kurusu of imperial japan hitler and italian foreign minister ciano and later expanded to include hungary romania and bulgaria thus yielding the axis powers hitlers attempt to integrate the soviet union into the anti-british bloc failed after inconclusive talks between hitler and molotov in berlin in november and he ordered preparations for the invasion of the soviet union
in early 1941 german forces were deployed to north africa the balkans and the middle east in february german forces arrived in libya to bolster the italian presence in april hitler launched the invasion of yugoslavia quickly followed by the invasion of greece in may german forces were sent to support iraqi rebel forces fighting against the british and to invade crete


 path to defeat 
on 22 june 1941 contravening the hitler–stalin non-aggression pact of 1939 4–5 million axis troops attacked the soviet union this offensive codenamed operation barbarossa was intended to destroy the soviet union and seize its natural resources for subsequent aggression against the western powers the invasion conquered a huge area including the baltic republics belarus and west ukraine by early august axis troops had advanced 500 km 310 mi and won the battle of smolensk hitler ordered army group centre to temporarily halt its advance to moscow and divert its panzer groups to aid in the encirclement of leningrad and kiev his generals disagreed with this change having advanced within 400 km 250 mi of moscow and his decision caused a crisis among the military leadership the pause provided the red army with an opportunity to mobilise fresh reserves historian russel stolfi considers it to be one of the major factors that caused the failure of the moscow offensive which was resumed in october 1941 and ended disastrously in december during this crisis hitler appointed himself as head of the oberkommando des heeres at the same time limiting its authority to the eastern front

on 7 december 1941 japan attacked the american fleet based at pearl harbor hawaii four days later hitler declared war against the united states
on 18 december 1941 himmler asked hitler what to do with the jews of russia to which hitler replied als partisanen auszurotten exterminate them as partisans israeli historian yehuda bauer has commented that the remark is probably as close as historians will ever get to a definitive order from hitler for the genocide carried out during the holocaust
in late 1942 german forces were defeated in the second battle of el alamein thwarting hitlers plans to seize the suez canal and the middle east overconfident in his own military expertise following the earlier victories in 1940 hitler became distrustful of his army high command and began to interfere in military and tactical planning with damaging consequences in december 1942 and january 1943 hitlers repeated refusal to allow their withdrawal at the battle of stalingrad led to the almost total destruction of the 6th army over 200,000 axis soldiers were killed and 235,000 were taken prisoner thereafter came a decisive strategic defeat at the battle of kursk hitlers military judgement became increasingly erratic and germanys military and economic position deteriorated as did hitlers health

following the allied invasion of sicily in 1943 mussolini was removed from power by victor emmanuel iii after a vote of no confidence of the grand council marshal pietro badoglio placed in charge of the government soon surrendered to the allies throughout 1943 and 1944 the soviet union steadily forced hitlers armies into retreat along the eastern front on 6 june 1944 the western allied armies landed in northern france in one of the largest amphibious operations in history operation overlord many german officers concluded that defeat was inevitable and that continuing under hitlers leadership would result in the complete destruction of the country
between 1939 and 1945 there were many plans to assassinate hitler some of which proceeded to significant degrees the most well known the 20 july plot came from within germany and was at least partly driven by the increasing prospect of a german defeat in the war in july 1944 in the 20 july plot part of operation valkyrie claus von stauffenberg planted a bomb in one of hitlers headquarters the wolfs lair at rastenburg hitler narrowly survived because staff officer heinz brandt moved the briefcase containing the bomb behind a leg of the heavy conference table which deflected much of the blast later hitler ordered savage reprisals resulting in the execution of more than 4,900 people


 defeat and death 

by late 1944 both the red army and the western allies were advancing into germany recognising the strength and determination of the red army hitler decided to use his remaining mobile reserves against the american and british troops which he perceived as far weaker on 16 december he launched the ardennes offensive to incite disunity among the western allies and perhaps convince them to join his fight against the soviets the offensive failed after some temporary successes with much of germany in ruins in january 1945 hitler spoke on the radio however grave as the crisis may be at this moment it will despite everything be mastered by our unalterable will hitlers hope to negotiate peace with the united states and britain was encouraged by the death of us president franklin d roosevelt on 12 april 1945 but contrary to his expectations this caused no rift among the allies acting on his view that germanys military failures meant it had forfeited its right to survive as a nation hitler ordered the destruction of all german industrial infrastructure before it could fall into allied hands minister for armaments albert speer was entrusted with executing this scorched earth policy but he secretly disobeyed the order
on 20 april his 56th birthday hitler made his last trip from the führerbunker führers shelter to the surface in the ruined garden of the reich chancellery he awarded iron crosses to boy soldiers of the hitler youth who were now fighting the red army at the front near berlin by 21 april georgy zhukovs 1st belorussian front had broken through the defences of general gotthard heinricis army group vistula during the battle of the seelow heights and advanced to the outskirts of berlin in denial about the dire situation hitler placed his hopes on the undermanned and under-equipped armeeabteilung steiner army detachment steiner commanded by waffen ss general felix steiner hitler ordered steiner to attack the northern flank of the salient while the german ninth army was ordered to attack northward in a pincer attack

during a military conference on 22 april hitler asked about steiners offensive he was told that the attack had not been launched and that the soviets had entered berlin hitler asked everyone except wilhelm keitel alfred jodl hans krebs and wilhelm burgdorf to leave the room then launched into a tirade against the treachery and incompetence of his commanders culminating in his declaration—for the first time—that everything was lost he announced that he would stay in berlin until the end and then shoot himself
by 23 april the red army had surrounded berlin and goebbels made a proclamation urging its citizens to defend the city that same day göring sent a telegram from berchtesgaden arguing that since hitler was isolated in berlin göring should assume leadership of germany göring set a deadline after which he would consider hitler incapacitated hitler responded by having göring arrested and in his last will and testament written on 29 april he removed göring from all government positions on 28 april hitler discovered that himmler who had left berlin on 20 april was trying to negotiate a surrender to the western allies he ordered himmlers arrest and had hermann fegelein himmlers ss representative at hitlers hq in berlin shot
after midnight on 29 april hitler married eva braun in a small civil ceremony in the führerbunker after a wedding breakfast with his new wife hitler dictated his will to his secretary traudl junge the event was witnessed and documents signed by krebs burgdorf goebbels and bormann later that afternoon hitler was informed of the execution of mussolini which presumably increased his determination to avoid capture
on 30 april 1945 when soviet troops were within a block or two of the reich chancellery hitler shot himself in the head and braun bit into a cyanide capsule their bodies were carried outside to the bombed-out garden behind the reich chancellery where they were placed in a bomb crater and doused with petrol the corpses were set on fire as the red army shelling continued grand admiral karl dönitz and joseph goebbels assumed hitlers roles as head of state and chancellor respectively
berlin surrendered on 2 may records in the soviet archives obtained after the fall of the soviet union state that the remains of hitler braun joseph and magda goebbels the six goebbels children general hans krebs and hitlers dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed on 4 april 1970 a soviet kgb team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the smersh facility in magdeburg the remains from the boxes were burned crushed and scattered into the biederitz river a tributary of the elbe according to kershaw the corpses of braun and hitler were fully burned when the red army found them and only a lower jaw with dental work could be identified as hitlers remains


 the holocaust 

if the international jewish financiers in and outside europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war then the result will not be the bolshevisation of the earth and thus the victory of jewry but the annihilation of the jewish race in europe

the holocaust and germanys war in the east were based on hitlers long-standing view that the jews were the enemy of the german people and that lebensraum was needed for germanys expansion he focused on eastern europe for this expansion aiming to defeat poland and the soviet union and then removing or killing the jews and slavs the generalplan ost general plan east called for deporting the population of occupied eastern europe and the soviet union to west siberia for use as slave labour or to be murdered the conquered territories were to be colonised by german or germanised settlers the goal was to implement this plan after the conquest of the soviet union but when this failed hitler moved the plans forward by january 1942 he had decided that the jews slavs and other deportees considered undesirable should be killed

the genocide was organised and executed by heinrich himmler and reinhard heydrich the records of the wannsee conference held on 20 january 1942 and led by heydrich with fifteen senior nazi officials participating provide the clearest evidence of systematic planning for the holocaust on 22 february hitler was recorded saying we shall regain our health only by eliminating the jews similarly at a meeting in july 1941 with leading functionaries of the eastern territories hitler said that the easiest way to quickly pacify the areas would be best achieved by shooting everyone who even looks odd although no direct order from hitler authorising the mass killings has surfaced his public speeches orders to his generals and the diaries of nazi officials demonstrate that he conceived and authorised the extermination of european jewry during the war hitler repeatedly stated his prophecy of 1939 was being fulfilled namely that a world war would bring about the annihilation of the jewish race hitler approved the einsatzgruppen—killing squads that followed the german army through poland the baltic and the soviet union—and was well informed about their activities by summer 1942 auschwitz concentration camp was expanded to accommodate large numbers of deportees for killing or enslavement scores of other concentration camps and satellite camps were set up throughout europe with several camps devoted exclusively to extermination
between 1939 and 1945 the schutzstaffel ss assisted by collaborationist governments and recruits from occupied countries was responsible for the deaths of at least eleven million people including 5.5 to 6 million jews representing two-thirds of the jewish population of europe and between 200,000 and 1,500,000 romani people deaths took place in concentration and extermination camps ghettos and through mass executions many victims of the holocaust were gassed to death while others died of starvation or disease or while working as slave labourers in addition to eliminating jews the nazis planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the hunger plan food supplies would be diverted to the german army and german civilians cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by german colonists together the hunger plan and generalplan ost would have led to the starvation of 80 million people in the soviet union these partially fulfilled plans resulted in additional deaths bringing the total number of civilians and prisoners of war who died in the democide to an estimated 19.3 million people
hitlers policies resulted in the killing of nearly two million non-jewish poles over three million soviet prisoners of war communists and other political opponents homosexuals the physically and mentally disabled jehovahs witnesses adventists and trade unionists hitler did not speak publicly about the killings and seems never to have visited the concentration camps
the nazis embraced the concept of racial hygiene on 15 september 1935 hitler presented two laws—known as the nuremberg laws—to the reichstag the laws banned sexual relations and marriages between aryans and jews and were later extended to include gypsies negroes or their bastard offspring the laws stripped all non-aryans of their german citizenship and forbade the employment of non-jewish women under the age of 45 in jewish households hitlers early eugenic policies targeted children with physical and developmental disabilities in a programme dubbed action brandt and he later authorised a euthanasia programme for adults with serious mental and physical disabilities now referred to as action t4


 leadership style 

hitler ruled the nsdap autocratically by asserting the führerprinzip leader principle the principle relied on absolute obedience of all subordinates to their superiors thus he viewed the government structure as a pyramid with himself—the infallible leader—at the apex rank in the party was not determined by elections—positions were filled through appointment by those of higher rank who demanded unquestioning obedience to the will of the leader hitlers leadership style was to give contradictory orders to his subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others to have the stronger one do the job in this way hitler fostered distrust competition and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power his cabinet never met after 1938 and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently hitler typically did not give written orders instead he communicated verbally or had them conveyed through his close associate martin bormann he entrusted bormann with his paperwork appointments and personal finances bormann used his position to control the flow of information and access to hitler
hitler dominated his countrys war effort during world war ii to a greater extent than any other national leader he strengthened his control of the armed forces in 1938 and subsequently made all major decisions regarding germanys military strategy his decision to mount a risky series of offensives against norway france and the low countries in 1940 against the advice of the military proved successful though the diplomatic and military strategies he employed in attempts to force the united kingdom out of the war ended in failure hitler deepened his involvement in the war effort by appointing himself commander-in-chief of the army in december 1941 from this point forward he personally directed the war against the soviet union while his military commanders facing the western allies retained a degree of autonomy hitlers leadership became increasingly disconnected from reality as the war turned against germany with the militarys defensive strategies often hindered by his slow decision making and frequent directives to hold untenable positions nevertheless he continued to believe that only his leadership could deliver victory in the final months of the war hitler refused to consider peace negotiations regarding the complete destruction of germany as preferable to surrender the military did not challenge hitlers dominance of the war effort and senior officers generally supported and enacted his decisions


 legacy 

hitlers suicide was likened by contemporaries to a spell being broken public support for hitler had collapsed by the time of his death and few germans mourned his passing kershaw argues that most civilians and military personnel were too busy adjusting to the collapse of the country or fleeing from the fighting to take any interest according to historian john toland national socialism burst like a bubble without its leader
hitlers actions and nazi ideology are almost universally regarded as gravely immoral according to kershaw never in history has such ruination—physical and moral—been associated with the name of one man hitlers political programme brought about a world war leaving behind a devastated and impoverished eastern and central europe germany itself suffered wholesale destruction characterised as stunde null zero hour hitlers policies inflicted human suffering on an unprecedented scale according to r j rummel the nazi regime was responsible for the democidal killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war in addition 29 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the european theatre of world war ii the number of civilians killed during the second world war was unprecedented in the history of warfare historians philosophers and politicians often use the word evil to describe the nazi regime many european countries have criminalised both the promotion of nazism and holocaust denial
historian friedrich meinecke described hitler as one of the great examples of the singular and incalculable power of personality in historical life english historian hugh trevor-roper saw him as among the terrible simplifiers of history the most systematic the most historical the most philosophical and yet the coarsest cruelest least magnanimous conqueror the world has ever known for the historian john m roberts hitlers defeat marked the end of a phase of european history dominated by germany in its place emerged the cold war a global confrontation between the western bloc dominated by the united states and other nato nations and the eastern bloc dominated by the soviet union historian sebastian haffner avers that without hitler and the displacement of the jews the modern nation state of israel would not exist he contends that without hitler the de-colonisation of former european spheres of influence would have been postponed further haffner claims that other than alexander the great hitler had a more significant impact than any other comparable historical figure in that he too caused a wide range of worldwide changes in a relatively short time span


 views on religion 

hitler was born to a practising catholic mother and an anticlerical father after leaving home hitler never again attended mass or received the sacraments speer states that hitler railed against the church to his political associates and though he never officially left it he had no attachment to it he adds that hitler felt that in the absence of organized religion people would turn to mysticism which he considered regressive according to speer hitler believed that japanese religious beliefs or islam would have been a more suitable religion for germans than christianity with its meekness and flabbiness
historian john s conway states that hitler was fundamentally opposed to the christian churches according to bullock hitler did not believe in god was anticlerical and held christian ethics in contempt because they contravened his preferred view of survival of the fittest he favoured aspects of protestantism that suited his own views and adopted some elements of the catholic churchs hierarchical organisation liturgy and phraseology
hitler viewed the church as an important politically conservative influence on society and he adopted a strategic relationship with it that suited his immediate political purposes in public hitler often praised christian heritage and german christian culture though professing a belief in an aryan jesus who fought against the jews any pro-christian public rhetoric contradicted his private statements which described christianity as absurdity and nonsense founded on lies
according to a us office of strategic services oss report the nazi master plan hitler planned to destroy the influence of christian churches within the reich his eventual goal was the total elimination of christianity this goal informed hitlers movement early on but he saw it as inexpedient to publicly express this extreme position according to bullock hitler wanted to wait until after the war before executing this plan
speer wrote that hitler had a negative view of himmlers and alfred rosenbergs mystical notions and himmlers attempt to mythologise the ss hitler was more pragmatic and his ambitions centred on more practical concerns


 health 

researchers have variously suggested that hitler suffered from irritable bowel syndrome skin lesions irregular heartbeat coronary sclerosis parkinsons disease syphilis giant-cell arteritis and tinnitus in a report prepared for the oss in 1943 walter c langer of harvard university described hitler as a neurotic psychopath in his 1977 book the psychopathic god adolf hitler historian robert g l waite proposes that he suffered from borderline personality disorder historians henrik eberle and hans-joachim neumann consider that while he suffered from a number of illnesses including parkinsons disease hitler did not experience pathological delusions and was always fully aware of and therefore responsible for his decisions theories about hitlers medical condition are difficult to prove and placing too much weight on them may have the effect of attributing many of the events and consequences of nazi germany to the possibly impaired physical health of one individual kershaw feels that it is better to take a broader view of german history by examining what social forces led to the nazi dictatorship and its policies rather than to pursue narrow explanations for the holocaust and world war ii based on only one person
hitler followed a vegetarian diet at social events he sometimes gave graphic accounts of the slaughter of animals in an effort to make his guests shun meat bormann had a greenhouse constructed near the berghof near berchtesgaden to ensure a steady supply of fresh fruit and vegetables for hitler hitler publicly avoided alcohol he occasionally drank beer and wine in private but gave up drinking because of weight gain in 1943 he was a non-smoker for most of his adult life but smoked heavily in his youth 25 to 40 cigarettes a day he eventually quit calling the habit a waste of money he encouraged his close associates to quit by offering a gold watch to anyone able to break the habit hitler began using amphetamine occasionally after 1937 and became addicted to it in late 1942 speer linked this use of amphetamine to hitlers increasingly erratic behavior and inflexible decision making for example rarely allowing military retreats
prescribed 90 medications during the war years by his personal physician theodor morell hitler took many pills each day for chronic stomach problems and other ailments he regularly consumed amphetamine barbiturates opiates and cocaine as well as potassium bromide and atropa belladonna the latter in the form of doktor kosters antigaspills he suffered ruptured eardrums as a result of the 20 july plot bomb blast in 1944 and 200 wood splinters had to be removed from his legs newsreel footage of hitler shows tremors in his left hand and a shuffling walk which began before the war and worsened towards the end of his life ernst-günther schenck and several other doctors who met hitler in the last weeks of his life also formed a diagnosis of parkinsons disease


 family 

hitler created a public image as a celibate man without a domestic life dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation he met his lover eva braun in 1929 and married her in april 1945 in september 1931 his half-niece geli raubal took her own life with hitlers gun in his munich apartment it was rumoured among contemporaries that geli was in a romantic relationship with him and her death was a source of deep lasting pain paula hitler the younger sister of hitler and the last living member of his immediate family died in 1960


 in propaganda films 

hitler exploited documentary films and newsreels to inspire a cult of personality he was involved and appeared in a series of propaganda films throughout his political career—such as der sieg des glaubens and triumph des willens—made by leni riefenstahl regarded as a pioneer of modern filmmaking


 list of propaganda and film appearances 
der sieg des glaubens victory of faith 1933
triumph des willens triumph of the will 1935
tag der freiheit unsere wehrmacht day of freedom our armed forces 1935
olympia 1938
