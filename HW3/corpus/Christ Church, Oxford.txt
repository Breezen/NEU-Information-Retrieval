 history 

in 1525 at the height of his power thomas wolsey lord chancellor of england and cardinal archbishop of york suppressed the priory of st frideswide in oxford and founded cardinal college on its lands using funds from the dissolution of wallingford priory and other minor priories he planned the establishment on a magnificent scale but fell from grace in 1529 with the buildings only three-quarters complete as they were to remain for 140 years
in 1531 the college was itself suppressed but it was refounded in 1532 as king henry viiis college by henry viii to whom wolseys property had escheated then in 1546 the king who had broken from the church of rome and acquired great wealth through the dissolution of the monasteries in england refounded the college as christ church as part of the reorganisation of the church of england making the partially demolished priory church the cathedral of the recently created diocese of oxford
christ churchs sister college in the university of cambridge is trinity college cambridge founded the same year by henry viii since the time of queen elizabeth i the college has also been associated with westminster school the dean remains to this day an ex officio member of the schools governing body
major additions have been made to the buildings through the centuries and wolseys great quadrangle was crowned with the famous gate-tower designed by sir christopher wren to this day the bell in the tower great tom is rung 101 times at 9 pm at the former oxford time 905 pm gmtbst every night for the 100 original scholars of the college plus one added in 1664 in former times this was done at midnight signalling the close of all college gates throughout oxford since it took 20 minutes to ring the 101 christ church gates unlike those of other colleges did not close until 1220 when the ringing was moved back to 900 pm christ church gates still remained open until 12.20 20 minutes later than any other college although the clock itself now shows gmtbst christ church still follows oxford time in the timings of services in the cathedral
king charles i made the deanery his palace and held his parliament in the great hall during the english civil war in the evening of 29 may 1645 during the second siege of oxford a bullet of ix lb weight shot from the parliamentarians warning-piece at marston fell against the wall of the north side of the hall
several of christ churchs deans achieved high academic distinction notably aldrich and fell in the restoration period jackson and gaisford in the early 19th century and liddell in the high victorian era during the commonwealth john owen attained considerable eminence


 organisation 
christ church formally titled the dean chapter and students of the cathedral church of christ in oxford of the foundation of king henry the eighth is the only academic institution in the world which is also a cathedral the seat cathedra of the bishop of oxford the visitor of christ church is the reigning british sovereign currently queen elizabeth ii and the bishop of oxford is unique among english bishops in not being the visitor of his own cathedral
the head of the college is the dean of christ church who is a clergyman appointed by the crown as dean of the cathedral church there are a senior and a junior censor formally titled the censor moralis philosophiae and the censor naturalis philosophiae the former of whom is responsible for academic matters the latter for undergraduate discipline a censor theologiae is also appointed to act as the deans deputy
the form christ church college is considered incorrect in part because it ignores the cathedral an integral part of the unique dual foundation


 governing body 
the governing body of christ church consists of the dean and chapter of the cathedral together with the students of christ church who are not junior members but rather the equivalent of the fellows of the other colleges until the later 19th century the students differed from fellows in that they had no governing powers in their own college these residing solely with the dean and chapter

 christ church references 

midnight has come and the great christ church bell
and many a lesser bell sound through the room
and it is all souls night

the wind had dropped there was even a glimpse of the moon riding behind the clouds and now a solemn and plangent token of oxfords perpetuity the first stroke of great tom sounded

i must say my thoughts wandered but i kept turning the pages and watching the light fade which in peckwater my dear is quite an experience – as darkness falls the stone seems positively to decay under ones eyes i was reminded of some of those leprous façades in the vieux port at marseille until suddenly i was disturbed by such a bawling and caterwauling as you never heard and there down in the little piazza i saw a mob of about twenty terrible young men and do you know what they were chanting we want blanche we want blanche in a kind of litany

those twins  of learning that he wolsey raised in you
ipswich and oxford one of which fell with him
unwilling to outlive the good that did it
the other though unfinishd yet so famous
so excellent in art and still so rising
that christendom shall ever speak his virtue

by way of light entertainment i should tell the committee that it is well known that a match between an archer and a golfer can be fairly close i spent many a happy evening in the centre of peckwater quadrangle at christ church with a bow and arrow trying to put an arrow over the kilcannon building into the mercury pond in tom quad on occasion the golfer would win and on occasion i would win unfortunately that had to stop when i put an arrow through the bowler hat of the head porter luckily he was unhurt and bore me no ill will from that time on he always sent me a christmas card which was signed to robin hood from the ancient briton

there is one oddity rudge determined to try for oxford christ church of all places might get into loughborough in a bad year
