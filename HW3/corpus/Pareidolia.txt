pareidolia  parr-i-doh-lee-ə is a psychological phenomenon in which the mind responds to a stimulus usually an image or a sound by perceiving a familiar pattern where none exists
common examples are perceived images of animals faces or objects in cloud formations the man in the moon the moon rabbit hidden messages within recorded music played in reverse or at higher- or lower-than-normal speeds and hearing indistinct voices in random noise such as that produced by air conditioners or fans


 etymology 
the word derives from the greek words para παρά beside alongside instead of — in this context meaning something faulty or wrong and the noun eidōlon εἴδωλον image form shape — the diminutive of eidos


 explanations 

pareidolia can cause people to interpret random images or patterns of light and shadow as faces a 2009 magnetoencephalography study found that objects perceived as faces evoke an early 165 ms activation of the fusiform face area at a time and location similar to that evoked by faces whereas other common objects do not evoke such activation this activation is similar to a slightly faster time 130 ms that is seen for images of real faces the authors suggest that face perception evoked by face-like objects is a relatively early process and not a late cognitive reinterpretation phenomenon a functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri study in 2011 similarly showed that repeated presentation of novel visual shapes that were interpreted as meaningful led to decreased fmri responses for real objects these results indicate that the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli depends upon processes similar to those elicited by known objects
these studies help to explain why people identify a few circles and a line as a face so quickly and without hesitation cognitive processes are activated by the face-like object which alert the observer to both the emotional state and identity of the subject even before the conscious mind begins to process or even receive the information a stick figure face despite its simplicity can convey mood information and be drawn to indicate emotions such as happiness or anger this robust and subtle capability is hypothesized to be the result of eons of natural selection favoring people most able to quickly identify the mental state for example of threatening people thus providing the individual an opportunity to flee or attack pre-emptively in other words processing this information subcortically — therefore subconsciously — before it is passed on to the rest of the brain for detailed processing accelerates judgment and decision making when a fast reaction is needed this ability though highly specialized for the processing and recognition of human emotions also functions to determine the demeanor of wildlife
pareidolia can be considered a subcategory of apophenia


 mimetoliths 
rocks may come to mimic recognizable forms through the random processes of formation weathering and erosion most often the size scale of the rock is larger than the object it resembles such as a cliff profile resembling a human face well-meaning people with a new interest in fossils can pick up chert nodules concretions or pebbles resembling bones skulls turtle shells dinosaur eggs etc in both size and shape
in the late 1970s and early 1980s japanese researcher chonosuke okamura self-published a series of reports titled original report of the okamura fossil laboratory in which he described tiny inclusions in polished limestone from the silurian period 425 mya as being preserved fossil remains of tiny humans gorillas dogs dragons dinosaurs and other organisms all of them only millimeters long leading him to claim there have been no changes in the bodies of mankind since the silurian period except for a growth in stature from 3.5 mm to 1,700 mm okamuras research earned him an ig nobel prize a parody of the nobel prizes in biodiversity in 1996


 projective tests 

the rorschach inkblot test uses pareidolia in an attempt to gain insight into a persons mental state the rorschach is a projective test as it intentionally elicits the thoughts or feelings of respondents that are projected onto the ambiguous inkblot images projection in this instance is a form of directed pareidolia


 art 

in his notebooks leonardo da vinci wrote of pareidolia as a device for painters writing if you look at any walls spotted with various stains or with a mixture of different kinds of stones if you are about to invent some scene you will be able to see in it a resemblance to various different landscapes adorned with mountains rivers rocks trees plains wide valleys and various groups of hills you will also be able to see divers combats and figures in quick movement and strange expressions of faces and outlandish costumes and an infinite number of things which you can then reduce into separate and well conceived forms


 religious 

there have been many instances of perceptions of religious imagery and themes especially the faces of religious figures in ordinary phenomena many involve images of jesus the virgin mary the word allah or other religious phenomena in september 2007 in singapore for example a callus on a tree resembled a monkey leading believers to pay homage to the monkey god either sun wukong or hanuman in the monkey tree phenomenon
publicity surrounding sightings of religious figures and other surprising images in ordinary objects has spawned a market for such items on online auctions like ebay one famous instance was a grilled cheese sandwich with the face of the virgin mary


 computer vision 

pareidolia also arises in computer vision specifically in image recognition programs which can spuriously detect features in the case of an artificial neural network higher-level features correspond to more recognizable features and enhancing these features brings out what the computer sees these reflect the training set of images that the network has seen previously
striking visuals can be produced in this way notably in the deepdream software which falsely detects and then exaggerates features such as eyes and faces in any image


 speech 
in 1971 konstantīns raudive wrote breakthrough detailing what he believed was the discovery of electronic voice phenomena evp evp has been described as auditory pareidolia allegations of backmasking in popular music in which a listener claims a message has been recorded backward onto a track meant to be played forward have also been described as auditory pareidolia in 1995 the psychologist diana deutsch invented an algorithm for producing phantom words and phrases with the sounds coming from two stereo loudspeakers with one to the listeners left and the other to his right each loudspeaker produces a phrase consisting of two words or syllables the same sequence is presented repeatedly through both loudspeakers however they are offset in time so that one when the first sound word or syllable is coming from the speaker on the left the second sound is coming from the speaker on the right and vice versa after listening for a while phantom words and phrases suddenly emerge and these often appear to reflect what is on the listeners mind and they transform perceptually into different words and phrases as the sequence continues


 related phenomena 
various european ancient divination practices involved the interpretation of shadows cast by objects for example in molybdomancy a random shape produced by pouring molten tin into cold water is interpreted by the shadow it casts in candlelight
a shadow person also known as a shadow figure shadow being or black mass is often attributed to pareidolia it is the perception of a patch of shadow as a living humanoid figure particularly as interpreted by believers in the paranormal or supernatural as the presence of a spirit or other entity
pareidolia is also what some skeptics believe causes people to believe that they have seen ghosts
