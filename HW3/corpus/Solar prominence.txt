a prominence is a large bright gaseous feature extending outward from the suns surface often in a loop shape prominences are anchored to the suns surface in the photosphere and extend outwards into the suns corona while the corona consists of extremely hot ionized gases known as plasma which do not emit much visible light prominences contain much cooler plasma similar in composition to that of the chromosphere the prominence plasma is typically a hundred times more lit and denser than the coronal plasma a prominence forms over timescales of about a day and may persist in the corona for several weeks or months looping hundreds of thousands of miles into space some prominences break apart and may then give rise to coronal mass ejections scientists are currently researching how and why prominences are formed
the red-glowing looped material is plasma a hot gas composed of electrically charged hydrogen and helium the prominence plasma flows along a tangled and twisted structure of magnetic fields generated by the sun’s internal dynamo an erupting prominence occurs when such a structure becomes unstable and bursts outward releasing the plasma
a typical prominence extends over many thousands of kilometers the largest on record was estimated at over 800,000 kilometres 500,000 mi long – roughly the radius of the sun


 historical 
the first detailed description of a solar prominence was in 14th-century laurentian codex describing the solar eclipse of 1 may 1185 they were described as flame-like tongues of live embers


 prominences and filaments 
when a prominence is viewed from a different perspective so that it is against the sun instead of against space it appears darker than the surrounding background this formation is instead called a solar filament it is possible for a projection to be both a filament and a prominence some prominences are so powerful that they throw out matter from the sun into space at speeds ranging from 600 kms to more than 1000 kms other prominences form huge loops or arching columns of glowing gases over sunspots that can reach heights of hundreds of thousands of kilometers prominences may last for a few days or even for a few months
