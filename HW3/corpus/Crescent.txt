 symbolism 

the crescent symbol is primarily used to represent the moon not necessarily in a particular lunar phase when used to represent a waxing or waning lunar phase crescent or increscent refers to the waxing first quarter while the symbol representing the waning final quarter is called decrescent
the crescent symbol was long used as a symbol of the moon in astrology and by extension of silver as the corresponding metal in alchemy the astrological use of the symbol is attested in early greek papyri containing horoscopes in the 2nd-century bianchinis planisphere the personification of the moon is shown with a crescent attached to her headdress
its ancient association with ishtarastarte and diana is preserved in the moon as symbolised by a crescent representing the female principle as juxtaposed with the sun representing the male principle and artemis-diana being a virgin goddess especially virginity and female chastity in roman catholic tradition the crescent entered marian iconography by the association of mary with the woman of the apocalypse described with the moon under her feet and on her head a crown of twelve stars in revelation the most well known representation of mary as the woman of the apocalypse is the virgin of guadalupe


 shape 

the crescent shape consists of a circular disk with a segment of another circle removed from its edge so that what remains is a shape enclosed by two circular arcs of different diameters which intersect at two points usually in such a manner that the enclosed shape does not include the center of the original circle as such it belongs to the class of figures known as lune in planar geometry the tapering towards the points of intersection of the two arcs are known as the horns of the crescent the classical crescent shape has its horns pointing upward and is often worn as horns when worn as a crown or diadem eg in depictions of the lunar goddess or in the headdress of persian kings etc
the word crescent is derived etymologically from the present participle of the latin verb crescere to grow technically denoting the waxing moon luna crescens as seen from the northern hemisphere the waxing moon tends to appear with its horns pointing towards the left and conversely the waning moon with its horns pointing towards the right the english word crescent may however refer to the shape regardless of its orientation except for the technical language of blazoning used in heraldry where the word increscent refers to a crescent shape with its horns to the left and decrescent refers to one with its horns to the right while the word crescent on its own denotes a crescent shape with horns pointing upward
the shape of the lit side of a spherical body most notably the moon that appears to be less than half illuminated by the sun as seen by the viewer appears in a different shape from what is generally termed a crescent in planar geometry assuming the terminator lies on a great circle the crescent moon will actually apperar as the figure bounded by a half-ellipse and a half-circle with the major axis of the ellipse coinciding with a diameter of the semicircle
