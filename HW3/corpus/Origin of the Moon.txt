the origin of the moon is usually thought to be that a mars-sized body struck the earth making a debris ring that eventually collected into a single natural satellite the moon but there are a number of variations on this giant-impact hypothesis as well as alternate explanations and research into how the moon came to be continues other proposed scenarios include captured body fission formed together condensation theory planetesimal collisions formed from asteroid-like bodies and collision theories
the standard giant-impact hypothesis suggests the mars-sized body called theia impacted earth creating a large debris ring around earth which then accreted to form the moon this collision also resulted in the 23.5° tilted axis of the earth thus causing the seasons the moons oxygen isotopic ratios seem to be essentially identical to earths oxygen isotopic ratios which may be measured very precisely yield a unique and distinct signature for each solar system body if theia had been a separate protoplanet it probably would have had a different oxygen isotopic signature from earth as would the ejected mixed material also the moons titanium isotope ratio 50ti47ti appears so close to the earths within 4 ppm that little if any of the colliding bodys mass could likely have been part of the moon


 formation 

some theories have been stated that presume the earth had no large moons early in the formation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago earth being basically rock and lava theia an early protoplanet the size of mars hit earth in such a way that it ejected a considerable amount of material away from earth some proportion of this ejecta escaped into space but the rest consolidated into a single body in orbit about earth creating the moon
the hypothesis requires a collision between a body about 90% of the present size of earth and another the diameter of mars half of the terrestrial radius and a tenth of its mass the colliding body has sometimes been referred to as theia the mother of selene the moon goddess in greek mythology this size ratio is needed in order for the resulting system to have sufficient angular momentum to match the current orbital configuration such an impact would have put enough material into orbit around earth to have eventually accumulated to form the moon
computer simulations show a need for a glancing blow which causes a portion of the collider to form a long arm of material that then shears off the asymmetrical shape of the earth following the collision then causes this material to settle into an orbit around the main mass the energy involved in this collision is impressive possibly trillions of tons of material would have been vaporized and melted in parts of the earth the temperature would have risen to 10,000 °c 18,000 °f
the moons relatively small iron core is explained by theias core accreting into that of earth the lack of volatiles in the lunar samples is also explained in part by the energy of the collision the energy liberated during the reaccreation of material in orbit around earth would have been sufficient to melt a large portion of the moon leading to the generation of a magma ocean
the newly formed moon orbited at about one-tenth the distance that it does today and spiraled outward because of tidal friction transferring angular momentum from the rotations of both bodies to the moons orbital motion along the way the moons rotation became tidally locked to earth so that one side of the moon continually faces toward earth also the moon would have collided with and incorporated any small pre-existing satellites of earth which would have shared the earths composition including isotopic abundances the geology of the moon has since been more independent of the earth although this hypothesis explains many aspects of the earth–moon system there are still a few unresolved problems such as the moons volatile elements not being as depleted as expected from such an energetic impact
another issue is lunar and earth isotope comparisons in 2001 the most precise measurement yet of the isotopic signatures of moon rocks was published surprisingly the apollo lunar samples carried an isotopic signature identical to earth rocks but different from other solar system bodies because most of the material that went into orbit to form the moon was thought to come from theia this observation was unexpected in 2007 researchers from caltech showed that the likelihood of theia having an identical isotopic signature as the earth is very small 1 percent published in 2012 an analysis of titanium isotopes in apollo lunar samples showed that the moon has the same composition as earth which conflicts with the moon forming far from earths orbit
to help resolve these problems a new theory published in 2012 posits that two bodies—each five times the size of mars—collided then re-collided forming a large disc of debris that eventually formed earth and the moon the paper was called “forming a moon with an earth-like composition via a giant impact” by rm canup
a 2012 study on the depletion of zinc isotopes on the moon supported the giant-impact origin for earth and the moon
in 2013 a study was released that indicated that water in lunar magma is indistinguishable from carbonaceous chondrites and nearly the same as that of earth in isotopic composition
the giant-impact hypothesis was again challenged in september 2013 with a growing sense that lunar origins are more complicated
in 2018 researchers at harvard and the university of california developed computer models demonstrating that one possible outcome of a planetary collision is that it creates a synestia a mass of vaporized rock and metal which form a torus extending beyond the lunar orbit the synestia will eventually shrink and cool to create the satellite and reform the impacted planet
another possibility is that before the giant impact earth had one or more normal satellites that shared its composition following the impact the moon formed closer to earth than these satellites and then spiraled outward colliding with them if the moon was more massive than the other satellites its tidal effect on earth would have been greater making it spiral outward faster this led to the moon being covered with material with the same composition as the satellites and so earth
in 2017 planetary researchers at weizmann institute of science in rehovot israel offered a new theory that suggests the moon was forged in a brutal rain of cosmic debris that repeatedly hammered the fledgling earth over millions of years they determined that a series of smaller impacts which were likely more common in the early solar system could blast enough earth rocks and dirt into orbit to form a small moonlet as repeated impacts created more balls of debris the moonlets could merge over time into one large moon


 other hypotheses 


 capture 
this hypothesis states that the moon was captured by the earth this was popular until the 1980s and some things in favor of this model include the moons size orbit and tidal locking
one problem is understanding the capture mechanism a close encounter with earth typically results in either collision or altered trajectories for this hypothesis to function there might have been a large atmosphere around the primitive earth which would slow the movement of the moon by natural aerobraking before it could escape that hypothesis may also explain the irregular satellite orbits of jupiter and saturn this hypothesis also has difficulty explaining the essentially identical oxygen isotope ratios of the two bodies


 fission 
this is the now discredited hypothesis that an ancient rapidly spinning earth expelled a piece of its mass this was proposed by george darwin son of the famous biologist charles darwin in the 1800s and retained some popularity until apollo the austrian geologist otto ampherer in 1925 also suggested the emerging of the moon as cause for continental drift
it was proposed that the pacific ocean represented the scar of this event today it is known that the oceanic crust that makes up this ocean basin is relatively young about 200 million years old or less whereas the moon is much older the moon does not consist of oceanic crust but of mantle material which originated inside the proto-earth in the precambrian


 accretion 
the hypothesis of accretion suggests that the earth and the moon formed together as a double system from the primordial accretion disk of the solar system the problem with this hypothesis is that it does not explain the angular momentum of the earth-moon system or why the moon has a relatively small iron core compared to the earth 25% of its radius compared to 50% for the earth


 additional theories and studies 


 2011 
in 2011 it was theorized that a second moon existed 4.5 billion years ago and later had an impact with the moon as a part of the accretion process in the formation of the moon


 2013 
one hypothesis presented only as a possibility was that the earth took the moon from venus


 2017 
uranium–lead dating of apollo 14 zircon fragments shows the age of the moon to be about 4.51 billion years
