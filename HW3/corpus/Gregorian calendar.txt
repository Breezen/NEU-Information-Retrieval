the gregorian calendar is internationally the most widely used civil calendar it is named after pope gregory xiii who introduced it in october 1582
it was a refinement to the julian calendar involving an approximately 0.002% correction in the length of the calendar year the motivation for the reform was to stop the drift of the calendar with respect to the equinoxes and solstices—particularly the northern vernal equinox which helps set the date for easter transition to the gregorian calendar would restore the holiday to the time of the year in which it was celebrated when introduced by the early church the reform was adopted initially by the catholic countries of europe protestants and eastern orthodox countries continued to use the traditional julian calendar and adopted the gregorian reform one by one after a time at least for civil purposes and for the sake of convenience in international trade the last european country to adopt the reform was greece in 1923 many but not all countries that have traditionally used the julian calendar or the islamic or other religious calendars have come to adopt the gregorian calendar for civil purposes
the gregorian reform contained two parts a reform of the julian calendar as used prior to pope gregory xiiis time and a reform of the lunar cycle used by the church with the julian calendar to calculate the date of easter the reform was a modification of a proposal made by aloysius lilius who proposed to reduce the number of leap years that occur in every four centuries from 100 to 97 by making 3 out of 4 centurial years common years instead of leap years lilius also produced an original and practical scheme for adjusting the epacts of the moon when calculating the annual date of easter solving a long-standing obstacle to calendar reform
the gregorian reform modified the julian calendars scheme of leap years as follows

every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year except for years that are exactly divisible by 100 but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400 for example the years 1700 1800 and 1900 are not leap years but the year 2000 is

in addition to the change in the mean length of the calendar year from 365.25 days 365 days 6 hours to 365.2425 days 365 days 5 hours 49 minutes 12 seconds a reduction of 10 minutes 48 seconds per year the gregorian calendar reform also dealt with the accumulated difference between these lengths the canonical easter tables were devised at the end of the third century when the vernal equinox fell either on 20 march or 21 march depending on the years position in the leap year cycle as the rule was that the full moon preceding easter was not to precede the equinox the date was fixed at 21 march for computational purposes and the earliest date for easter was fixed at 22 march the gregorian calendar reproduced these conditions by removing ten days
to unambiguously specify a date dual dating or old style and new style dates are sometimes used dual dating gives two consecutive years for a given date because of differences in the starting date of the year or to give both the julian and the gregorian dates the old style os and new style ns notations indicate either that the start of the julian year has or has not been adjusted to start on 1 january even though documents written at the time use a different start of year or that a date conforms to the old julian calendar rather than the new gregorian
the gregorian calendar continued to use the previous calendar era year-numbering system which counts years from the traditional date of the nativity anno domini originally calculated in the 6th century by dionysius exiguus this year-numbering system also known as dionysian era or common era is the predominant international standard today


 description 

the gregorian calendar is a solar calendar a regular gregorian year consists of 365 days but as in the julian calendar in certain years a leap year a leap day is added to february in the julian calendar a leap year occurs every 4 years but the gregorian calendar omits a leap day in three of every 400 years in the julian calendar the leap day was inserted by doubling 24 february and the gregorian reform did not change the date of the leap day in the modern period it has become customary to number the days from the beginning of the month and 29 february is typically considered as the leap day before the 1969 revision of the roman calendar the roman catholic church delayed february feasts after the 23rd by one day in leap years masses celebrated according to the previous calendar still reflect this delay
gregorian years are identified by consecutive year numbers the cycles repeat completely every 146,097 days which equals 400 years of these 400 years 303 are regular years of 365 days and 97 are leap years of 366 days a mean calendar year is 365 97/400 days  365.2425 days or 365 days 5 hours 49 minutes and 12 seconds
a calendar date is fully specified by the year numbered by some scheme beyond the scope of the calendar itself the month identified by name or number and the day of the month numbered sequentially starting at 1 although the calendar year currently runs from 1 january to 31 december at previous times year numbers were based on a different starting point within the calendar see the beginning of the year section below


 gregorian reform 

the gregorian calendar was a reform of the julian calendar it was instituted in 1582 by pope gregory xiii after whom the calendar was named by papal bull inter gravissimas dated 24 february 1582 the motivation for the adjustment was to bring the date for the celebration of easter to the time of year in which it was celebrated when it was introduced by the early church the error in the julian calendar its assumption that there are exactly 365.25 days in a year had led to the date of the equinox according to the calendar drifting from the observed reality and thus an error had been introduced into the calculation of the date of easter although a recommendation of the first council of nicaea in 325 specified that all christians should celebrate easter on the same day it took almost five centuries before virtually all christians achieved that objective by adopting the rules of the church of alexandria see easter for the issues which arose


 background 

because the date of easter was tied to the spring equinox the roman catholic church considered the seasonal drift in the date of easter undesirable the church of alexandria celebrated easter on the sunday after the 14th day of the moon computed using the metonic cycle that falls on or after the vernal equinox which they placed on 21 march however the church of rome still regarded 25 march lady day as the equinox until 342 and used a different cycle to compute the day of the moon in the alexandrian system since the 14th day of the easter moon could fall at earliest on 21 march its first day could fall no earlier than 8 march and no later than 5 april this meant that easter varied between 22 march and 25 april in rome easter was not allowed to fall later than 21 april that being the day of the parilia or birthday of rome and a pagan festival the first day of the easter moon could fall no earlier than 5 march and no later than 2 april
easter was the sunday after the 15th day of this moon whose 14th day was allowed to precede the equinox where the two systems produced different dates there was generally a compromise so that both churches were able to celebrate on the same day by the 10th century all churches except some on the eastern border of the byzantine empire had adopted the alexandrian easter which still placed the vernal equinox on 21 march although bede had already noted its drift in 725—it had drifted even further by the 16th century
worse the reckoned moon that was used to compute easter was fixed to the julian year by a 19-year cycle that approximation built up an error of one day every 310 years so by the 16th century the lunar calendar was out of phase with the real moon by four days
european scholars had been well aware of the calendar drift since the early medieval period bede writing in the 8th century showed that the accumulated error in his day was more than three days roger bacon in c 1200 estimated the error at seven or eight days dante writing c 1300 was aware of the need of a calendar reform the first attempt to go forward with such a reform was undertaken by pope sixtus iv who in 1475 invited regiomontanus to the vatican for this purpose however the project was interrupted by the death of regiomontanus shortly after his arrival in rome the increase of astronomical knowledge and the precision of observations towards the end of the 15th century made the question more pressing numerous publications over the following decades called for a calendar reform among them a paper sent to the vatican by the university of salamanca in 1515 but the project was not taken up again until the 1540s and implemented only under pope gregory xiii r 1572–1585


 preparation 
in 1545 the council of trent authorized pope paul iii to reform the calendar requiring that the date of the vernal equinox be restored to that which it held at the time of the first council of nicaea in 325 and that an alteration to the calendar be designed to prevent future drift this would allow for a more consistent and accurate scheduling of the feast of easter
in 1577 a compendium was sent to expert mathematicians outside the reform commission for comments some of these experts including giambattista benedetti and giuseppe moleto believed easter should be computed from the true motions of the sun and moon rather than using a tabular method but these recommendations were not adopted the reform adopted was a modification of a proposal made by the calabrian doctor aloysius lilius or lilio
liliuss proposal included reducing the number of leap years in four centuries from 100 to 97 by making three out of four centurial years common instead of leap years he also produced an original and practical scheme for adjusting the epacts of the moon when calculating the annual date of easter solving a long-standing obstacle to calendar reform
ancient tables provided the suns mean longitude christopher clavius the architect of the gregorian calendar noted that the tables agreed neither on the time when the sun passed through the vernal equinox nor on the length of the mean tropical year tycho brahe also noticed discrepancies the gregorian leap year rule 97 leap years in 400 years was put forward by petrus pitatus of verona in 1560 he noted that it is consistent with the tropical year of the alfonsine tables and with the mean tropical year of copernicus de revolutionibus and reinhold prutenic tables the three mean tropical years in babylonian sexagesimals as the excess over 365 days the way they would have been extracted from the tables of mean longitude were 14,33,9,57 alphonsine 14,33,11,12 copernicus and 14,33,9,24 reinhold all values are the same to two places 1433 and this is also the mean length of the gregorian year thus pitatus solution would have commended itself to the astronomers
liliuss proposals had two components firstly he proposed a correction to the length of the year the mean tropical year is 365.24219 days long as the average length of a julian year is 365.25 days the julian year is almost 11 minutes longer than the mean tropical year the discrepancy results in a drift of about three days every 400 years liliuss proposal resulted in an average year of 365.2425 days see accuracy at the time of gregorys reform there had already been a drift of 10 days since the council of nicaea resulting in the vernal equinox falling on 10 or 11 march instead of the ecclesiastically fixed date of 21 march and if unreformed it would drift further lilius proposed that the 10-day drift should be corrected by deleting the julian leap day on each of its ten occurrences over a period of forty years thereby providing for a gradual return of the equinox to 21 march
liliuss work was expanded upon by christopher clavius in a closely argued 800-page volume he would later defend his and liliuss work against detractors claviuss opinion was that the correction should take place in one move and it was this advice which prevailed with gregory
the second component consisted of an approximation which would provide an accurate yet simple rule-based calendar liliuss formula was a 10-day correction to revert the drift since the council of nicaea and the imposition of a leap day in only 97 years in 400 rather than in 1 year in 4 the proposed rule was that years divisible by 100 would be leap years only if they were divisible by 400 as well
the 19-year cycle used for the lunar calendar was also to be corrected by one day every 300 or 400 years 8 times in 2500 years along with corrections for the years that are no longer leap years ie 1700 1800 1900 2100 etc in fact a new method for computing the date of easter was introduced
when the new calendar was put in use the error accumulated in the 13 centuries since the council of nicaea was corrected by a deletion of 10 days the julian calendar day thursday 4 october 1582 was followed by the first day of the gregorian calendar friday 15 october 1582 the cycle of weekdays was not affected


 adoption 

although gregorys reform was enacted in the most solemn of forms available to the church the bull had no authority beyond the catholic church and the papal states the changes that he was proposing were changes to the civil calendar over which he had no authority they required adoption by the civil authorities in each country to have legal effect
the bull inter gravissimas became the law of the catholic church in 1582 but it was not recognised by protestant churches eastern orthodox churches oriental orthodox churches and a few others consequently the days on which easter and related holidays were celebrated by different christian churches again diverged
a month after having decreed the reform the pope with a brief of 3 april 1582 granted to antonio lilio the brother of luigi lilio the exclusive right to publish the calendar for a period of ten years the lunario novo secondo la nuova riforma printed by vincenzo accolti one of the first calendars printed in rome after the reform notes at the bottom that it was signed with papal authorization and by lilio con licentia delli superiori et permissu antonii lilij the papal brief was later revoked on 20 september 1582 because antonio lilio proved unable to keep up with the demand for copies
on 29 september 1582 philip ii of spain decreed the change from the julian to the gregorian calendar this affected much of roman catholic europe as philip was at the time ruler over spain and portugal as well as much of italy in these territories as well as in the polish–lithuanian commonwealth ruled by anna jagiellon and in the papal states the new calendar was implemented on the date specified by the bull with julian thursday 4 october 1582 being followed by gregorian friday 15 october 1582 the spanish and portuguese colonies followed somewhat later de facto because of delay in communication
many protestant countries initially objected to adopting a catholic innovation some protestants feared the new calendar was part of a plot to return them to the catholic fold for example the british could not bring themselves to adopt the catholic system explicitly the annexe to their calendar new style act 1750 established a computation for the date of easter that achieved the same result as gregorys rules without actually referring to him
britain and the british empire including the eastern part of what is now the united states adopted the gregorian calendar in 1752 sweden followed in 1753
prior to 1917 turkey used the lunar islamic calendar with the hegira era for general purposes and the julian calendar for fiscal purposes the start of the fiscal year was eventually fixed at 1 march and the year number was roughly equivalent to the hegira year see rumi calendar as the solar year is longer than the lunar year this originally entailed the use of escape years every so often when the number of the fiscal year would jump from 1 march 1917 the fiscal year became gregorian rather than julian on 1 january 1926 the use of the gregorian calendar was extended to include use for general purposes and the number of the year became the same as in most other countries


 difference between gregorian and julian calendar dates 
since the introduction of the gregorian calendar the difference between gregorian and julian calendar dates has increased by three days every four centuries all date ranges are inclusive
this section always places the intercalary day on 29 february even though it was always obtained by doubling 24 february the bissextum twice sixth or bissextile day until the late middle ages the gregorian calendar is proleptic before 1582 assumed to exist before 1582
the following equation gives the number of days actually dates that the gregorian calendar is ahead of the julian calendar called the secular difference between the two calendars a negative difference means the julian calendar is ahead of the gregorian calendar

   means that if the result of the division is not an integer it is rounded down to the nearest integer thus during the 1900s 1900/400  4 while during the −500s −500/400  −2
the general rule in years which are leap years in the julian calendar but not the gregorian is as follows
up to 28 february in the calendar you are converting from add one day less or subtract one day more than the calculated value remember to give february the appropriate number of days for the calendar you are converting into when you are subtracting days to move from julian to gregorian be careful when calculating the gregorian equivalent of 29 february julian to remember that 29 february is discounted thus if the calculated value is −4 the gregorian equivalent of this date is 24 february


 beginning of the year 
the year used in dates during the roman republic and the roman empire was the consular year which began on the day when consuls first entered office—probably 1 may before 222 bc 15 march from 222 bc and 1 january from 153 bc the julian calendar which began in 45 bc continued to use 1 january as the first day of the new year even though the year used for dates changed the civil year always displayed its months in the order january to december from the roman republican period until the present
during the middle ages under the influence of the catholic church many western european countries moved the start of the year to one of several important christian festivals—25 december supposed nativity of jesus 25 march annunciation or easter france while the byzantine empire began its year on 1 september and russia did so on 1 march until 1492 when the new year was moved to 1 september
in common usage 1 january was regarded as new years day and celebrated as such but from the 12th century until 1751 the legal year in england began on 25 march lady day so for example the parliamentary record lists the execution of charles i on 30 january as occurring in 1648 as the year did not end until 24 march although later histories adjust the start of the year to 1 january and record the execution as occurring in 1649
most western european countries changed the start of the year to 1 january before they adopted the gregorian calendar for example scotland changed the start of the scottish new year to 1 january in 1600 this means that 1599 was a short year england ireland and the british colonies changed the start of the year to 1 january in 1752 so 1751 was a short year with only 282 days though in england the start of the tax year remained at 25 march os 5 april ns till 1800 when it moved to 6 april later in 1752 in september the gregorian calendar was introduced throughout britain and the british colonies see the section adoption these two reforms were implemented by the calendar new style act 1750
in some countries an official decree or law specified that the start of the year should be 1 january for such countries a specific year when a 1 january-year became the norm can be identified in other countries the customs varied and the start of the year moved back and forth as fashion and influence from other countries dictated various customs
neither the papal bull nor its attached canons explicitly fix such a date though it is implied by two tables of saints days one labelled 1582 which ends on 31 december and another for any full year that begins on 1 january it also specifies its epact relative to 1 january in contrast with the julian calendar which specified it relative to 22 march the old date was derived from the greek system the earlier supputatio romana specified it relative to 1 january


 dual dating 

during the period between 1582 when the first countries adopted the gregorian calendar and 1923 when the last european country adopted it it was often necessary to indicate the date of some event in both the julian calendar and in the gregorian calendar for example 10/21 february 1750/51 where the dual year accounts for some countries already beginning their numbered year on 1 january while others were still using some other date even before 1582 the year sometimes had to be double dated because of the different beginnings of the year in various countries woolley writing in his biography of john dee 1527–1608/9 notes that immediately after 1582 english letter writers customarily used two dates on their letters one os and one ns


 old style and new style dates 

old style os and new style ns are sometimes added to dates to identify which calendar reference system is used for the date given in britain and its colonies where the calendar act of 1750 altered the start of the year and also aligned the british calendar with the gregorian calendar there is some confusion as to what these terms mean they can indicate that the start of the julian year has been adjusted to start on 1 january ns even though contemporary documents use a different start of year os or to indicate that a date conforms to the julian calendar os formerly in use in many countries rather than the gregorian calendar ns


 proleptic gregorian calendar 

extending the gregorian calendar backwards to dates preceding its official introduction produces a proleptic calendar which should be used with some caution for ordinary purposes the dates of events occurring prior to 15 october 1582 are generally shown as they appeared in the julian calendar with the year starting on 1 january and no conversion to their gregorian equivalents for example the battle of agincourt is universally considered to have been fought on 25 october 1415 which is saint crispins day
usually the mapping of new dates onto old dates with a start of year adjustment works well with little confusion for events that happened before the introduction of the gregorian calendar but for the period between the first introduction of the gregorian calendar on 15 october 1582 and its introduction in britain on 14 september 1752 there can be considerable confusion between events in continental western europe and in british domains in english language histories
events in continental western europe are usually reported in english language histories as happening under the gregorian calendar for example the battle of blenheim is always given as 13 august 1704 confusion occurs when an event affects both for example william iii of england arrived at brixham in england on 5 november 1688 julian calendar after setting sail from the netherlands on 11 november 1688 gregorian calendar
shakespeare and cervantes seemingly died on exactly the same date 23 april 1616 but cervantes predeceased shakespeare by ten days in real time as spain used the gregorian calendar but britain used the julian calendar this coincidence encouraged unesco to make 23 april the world book and copyright day
astronomers avoid this ambiguity by the use of the julian day number
for dates before the year 1 unlike the proleptic gregorian calendar used in the international standard iso 8601 the traditional proleptic gregorian calendar like the julian calendar does not have a year 0 and instead uses the ordinal numbers 1 2 … both for years ad and bc thus the traditional time line is 2 bc 1 bc ad 1 and ad 2 iso 8601 uses astronomical year numbering which includes a year 0 and negative numbers before it thus the iso 8601 time line is −0001 0000 0001 and 0002


 months 
the gregorian calendar continued to employ the julian months which have latinate names and irregular numbers of days
january 31 days from latin mēnsis iānuārius month of janus the roman god of gates doorways beginnings and endings
february 28 days in common and 29 in leap years from latin mēnsis februārius month of the februa the roman festival of purgation and purification cognate with fever the etruscan death god februus purifier and the pie word for sulfur
march 31 days from latin mēnsis mārtius month of mars the roman war god
april 30 days from latin mēnsis aprīlis of uncertain meaning but usually derived from some form of the verb aperire to open or the name of the goddess aphrodite
may 31 days from latin mēnsis māius month of maia a roman vegetation goddess whose name is cognate with latin magnus great and english major
june 30 days from latin mēnsis iūnius month of juno the roman goddess of marriage childbirth and rule
july 31 days from latin mēnsis iūlius month of julius caesar the month of caesars birth instituted in 44 bc as part of his calendrical reforms
august 31 days from latin mēnsis augustus month of augustus instituted by augustus in 8 bc in agreement with july and from the occurrence during the month of several important events during his rise to power
september 30 days from latin mēnsis september seventh month from its position in the roman calendar before 153 bc
october 31 days from latin mēnsis octōber eighth month from its position in the roman calendar before 153 bc
november 30 days from latin mēnsis november ninth month from its position in the roman calendar before 153 bc
december 31 days from latin mēnsis december tenth month from its position in the roman calendar before 153 bc
europeans sometimes attempt to remember the number of days in each month by memorizing some form of the traditional verse thirty days hath september it appears in latin italian and french and belongs to a broad oral tradition but the earliest currently attested form of the poem is the english marginalia inserted into a calendar of saints c 1425

variations appeared in mother goose and continue to be taught at schools the unhelpfulness of such involved mnemonics has been parodied as thirty days hath september  but all the rest i cant remember but it has also been called probably the only sixteenth-century poem most ordinary citizens know by heart a common nonverbal alternative is the knuckle mnemonic considering the knuckles of ones hands as months with 31 days and the lower spaces between them as the months with fewer days using two hands one may start from either pinkie knuckle as january and count across omitting the space between the index knuckles july and august the same procedure can be done using the knuckles of a single hand returning from the last july to the first august and continuing through a similar mnemonic is to move up a piano keyboard in semitones from an f key taking the white keys as the longer months and the black keys as the shorter ones


 weeks 

in conjunction with the system of months there is a system of weeks a physical or electronic calendar provides conversion from a given date to the weekday and shows multiple dates for a given weekday and month calculating the day of the week is not very simple because of the irregularities in the gregorian system when the gregorian calendar was adopted by each country the weekly cycle continued uninterrupted for example in the case of the few countries that adopted the reformed calendar on the date proposed by gregory xiii for the calendars adoption friday 15 october 1582 the preceding date was thursday 4 october 1582 julian calendar
opinions vary about the numbering of the days of the week iso 8601 in common use worldwide starts with monday1 printed monthly calendar grids often list mondays in the first left column of dates and sundays in the last software often starts with sunday0 which places sundays in the left column of a monthly calendar page


 accuracy 
the gregorian calendar improves the approximation made by the julian calendar by skipping three julian leap days in every 400 years giving an average year of 365.2425 mean solar days long this approximation has an error of about one day per 3,030 years with respect to the current value of the mean tropical year however because of the precession of the equinoxes which is not constant and the movement of the perihelion which affects the earths orbital speed the error with respect to the astronomical vernal equinox is variable using the average interval between vernal equinoxes near 2000 of 365.24237 days implies an error closer to 1 day every 7,700 years by any criterion the gregorian calendar is substantially more accurate than the 1 day in 128 years error of the julian calendar average year 365.25 days
in the 19th century sir john herschel proposed a modification to the gregorian calendar with 969 leap days every 4000 years instead of 970 leap days that the gregorian calendar would insert over the same period this would reduce the average year to 365.24225 days herschels proposal would make the year 4000 and multiples thereof common instead of leap while this modification has often been proposed since it has never been officially adopted
on time scales of thousands of years the gregorian calendar falls behind the astronomical seasons because the slowing down of the earths rotation makes each day slightly longer over time see tidal acceleration and leap second while the year maintains a more uniform duration


 calendar seasonal error 

this image shows the difference between the gregorian calendar and the astronomical seasons
the y-axis is the date in june and the x-axis is gregorian calendar years
each point is the date and time of the june solstice in that particular year the error shifts by about a quarter of a day per year centurial years are ordinary years unless they are divisible by 400 in which case they are leap years this causes a correction in the years 1700 1800 1900 2100 2200 and 2300
for instance these corrections cause 23 december 1903 to be the latest december solstice and 20 december 2096 to be the earliest solstice—about 2.35 days of variation compared with the seasonal event
