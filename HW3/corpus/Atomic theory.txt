in chemistry and physics atomic theory is a scientific theory of the nature of matter which states that matter is composed of discrete units called atoms it began as a philosophical concept in ancient greece and entered the scientific mainstream in the early 19th century when discoveries in the field of chemistry showed that matter did indeed behave as if it were made up of atoms
the word atom comes from the ancient greek adjective atomos meaning indivisible 19th century chemists began using the term in connection with the growing number of irreducible chemical elements while seemingly apropos around the turn of the 20th century through various experiments with electromagnetism and radioactivity physicists discovered that the so-called uncuttable atom was actually a conglomerate of various subatomic particles chiefly electrons protons and neutrons which can exist separately from each other in fact in certain extreme environments such as neutron stars extreme temperature and pressure prevents atoms from existing at all
since atoms were found to be divisible physicists later invented the term elementary particles to describe the uncuttable though not indestructible parts of an atom the field of science which studies subatomic particles is particle physics and it is in this field that physicists hope to discover the true fundamental nature of matter


 history 


 philosophical atomism 

the idea that matter is made up of discrete units is a very old one appearing in many ancient cultures such as greece and india the word atom was coined by the ancient greek philosophers leucippus and his pupil democritus however these ideas were founded in philosophical and theological reasoning rather than evidence and experimentation because of this they could not convince everybody so atomism was but one of a number of competing theories on the nature of matter it was not until the 19th century that the idea was embraced and refined by scientists as the blossoming science of chemistry produced discoveries that could easily be explained using the concept of atoms


 john dalton 
near the end of the 18th century two laws about chemical reactions emerged without referring to the notion of an atomic theory the first was the law of conservation of mass formulated by antoine lavoisier in 1789 which states that the total mass in a chemical reaction remains constant that is the reactants have the same mass as the products the second was the law of definite proportions first proven by the french chemist joseph louis proust in 1799 this law states that if a compound is broken down into its constituent elements then the masses of the constituents will always have the same proportions regardless of the quantity or source of the original substance
john dalton studied and expanded upon this previous work and developed the law of multiple proportions if two elements can be combined to form a number of possible compounds then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers for example proust had studied tin oxides and found that their masses were either 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen or 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen these were tinii oxide and tin dioxide respectively dalton noted from these percentages that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 12 dalton found that an atomic theory of matter could elegantly explain this common pattern in chemistry in the case of prousts tin oxides one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms
dalton believed atomic theory could explain why water absorbed different gases in different proportions - for example he found that water absorbed carbon dioxide far better than it absorbed nitrogen dalton hypothesized this was due to the differences in mass and complexity of the gases respective particles indeed carbon dioxide molecules co2 are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules n2
dalton proposed that each chemical element is composed of atoms of a single unique type and though they cannot be altered or destroyed by chemical means they can combine to form more complex structures chemical compounds this marked the first truly scientific theory of the atom since dalton reached his conclusions by experimentation and examination of the results in an empirical fashion

in 1803 dalton orally presented his first list of relative atomic weights for a number of substances this paper was published in 1805 but he did not discuss there exactly how he obtained these figures the method was first revealed in 1807 by his acquaintance thomas thomson in the third edition of thomsons textbook a system of chemistry finally dalton published a full account in his own textbook a new system of chemical philosophy 1808 and 1810
dalton estimated the atomic weights according to the mass ratios in which they combined with the hydrogen atom taken as unity however dalton did not conceive that with some elements atoms exist in molecules—eg pure oxygen exists as o2 he also mistakenly believed that the simplest compound between any two elements is always one atom of each so he thought water was ho not h2o this in addition to the crudity of his equipment flawed his results for instance in 1803 he believed that oxygen atoms were 5.5 times heavier than hydrogen atoms because in water he measured 5.5 grams of oxygen for every 1 gram of hydrogen and believed the formula for water was ho adopting better data in 1806 he concluded that the atomic weight of oxygen must actually be 7 rather than 5.5 and he retained this weight for the rest of his life others at this time had already concluded that the oxygen atom must weigh 8 relative to hydrogen equals 1 if one assumes daltons formula for the water molecule ho or 16 if one assumes the modern water formula h2o


 avogadro 
the flaw in daltons theory was corrected in principle in 1811 by amedeo avogadro avogadro had proposed that equal volumes of any two gases at equal temperature and pressure contain equal numbers of molecules in other words the mass of a gass particles does not affect the volume that it occupies avogadros law allowed him to deduce the diatomic nature of numerous gases by studying the volumes at which they reacted for instance since two liters of hydrogen will react with just one liter of oxygen to produce two liters of water vapor at constant pressure and temperature it meant a single oxygen molecule splits in two in order to form two particles of water thus avogadro was able to offer more accurate estimates of the atomic mass of oxygen and various other elements and made a clear distinction between molecules and atoms


 brownian motion 
in 1827 the british botanist robert brown observed that dust particles inside pollen grains floating in water constantly jiggled about for no apparent reason in 1905 albert einstein theorized that this brownian motion was caused by the water molecules continuously knocking the grains about and developed a hypothetical mathematical model to describe it this model was validated experimentally in 1908 by french physicist jean perrin thus providing additional validation for particle theory and by extension atomic theory


 discovery of subatomic particles 

atoms were thought to be the smallest possible division of matter until 1897 when jj thomson discovered the electron through his work on cathode rays
a crookes tube is a sealed glass container in which two electrodes are separated by a vacuum when a voltage is applied across the electrodes cathode rays are generated creating a glowing patch where they strike the glass at the opposite end of the tube through experimentation thomson discovered that the rays could be deflected by an electric field in addition to magnetic fields which was already known he concluded that these rays rather than being a form of light were composed of very light negatively charged particles he called corpuscles they would later be renamed electrons by other scientists he measured the mass-to-charge ratio and discovered it was 1800 times smaller than that of hydrogen the smallest atom these corpuscles were a particle unlike any other previously known
thomson suggested that atoms were divisible and that the corpuscles were their building blocks to explain the overall neutral charge of the atom he proposed that the corpuscles were distributed in a uniform sea of positive charge this was the plum pudding model as the electrons were embedded in the positive charge like plums in a plum pudding although in thomsons model they were not stationary


 discovery of the nucleus 

thomsons plum pudding model was disproved in 1909 by one of his former students ernest rutherford who discovered that most of the mass and positive charge of an atom is concentrated in a very small fraction of its volume which he assumed to be at the very center
in the geiger–marsden experiment hans geiger and ernest marsden colleagues of rutherford working at his behest shot alpha particles at thin sheets of metal and measured their deflection through the use of a fluorescent screen given the very small mass of the electrons the high momentum of the alpha particles and the low concentration of the positive charge of the plum pudding model the experimenters expected all the alpha particles to pass through the metal foil without significant deflection to their astonishment a small fraction of the alpha particles experienced heavy deflection rutherford concluded that the positive charge of the atom must be concentrated in a very tiny volume to produce an electric field sufficiently intense to deflect the alpha particles so strongly
this led rutherford to propose a planetary model in which a cloud of electrons surrounded a small compact nucleus of positive charge only such a concentration of charge could produce the electric field strong enough to cause the heavy deflection


 first steps toward a quantum physical model of the atom 

the planetary model of the atom had two significant shortcomings the first is that unlike planets orbiting a sun electrons are charged particles an accelerating electric charge is known to emit electromagnetic waves according to the larmor formula in classical electromagnetism an orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus colliding with it in a small fraction of a second the second problem was that the planetary model could not explain the highly peaked emission and absorption spectra of atoms that were observed

quantum theory revolutionized physics at the beginning of the 20th century when max planck and albert einstein postulated that light energy is emitted or absorbed in discrete amounts known as quanta singular quantum in 1913 niels bohr incorporated this idea into his bohr model of the atom in which an electron could only orbit the nucleus in particular circular orbits with fixed angular momentum and energy its distance from the nucleus ie their radii being proportional to its energy under this model an electron could not spiral into the nucleus because it could not lose energy in a continuous manner instead it could only make instantaneous quantum leaps between the fixed energy levels when this occurred light was emitted or absorbed at a frequency proportional to the change in energy hence the absorption and emission of light in discrete spectra
bohrs model was not perfect it could only predict the spectral lines of hydrogen it couldnt predict those of multielectron atoms worse still as spectrographic technology improved additional spectral lines in hydrogen were observed which bohrs model couldnt explain in 1916 arnold sommerfeld added elliptical orbits to the bohr model to explain the extra emission lines but this made the model very difficult to use and it still couldnt explain more complex atoms


 discovery of isotopes 

while experimenting with the products of radioactive decay in 1913 radiochemist frederick soddy discovered that there appeared to be more than one element at each position on the periodic table the term isotope was coined by margaret todd as a suitable name for these elements
that same year jj thomson conducted an experiment in which he channeled a stream of neon ions through magnetic and electric fields striking a photographic plate at the other end he observed two glowing patches on the plate which suggested two different deflection trajectories thomson concluded this was because some of the neon ions had a different mass the nature of this differing mass would later be explained by the discovery of neutrons in 1932


 discovery of nuclear particles 

in 1917 rutherford bombarded nitrogen gas with alpha particles and observed hydrogen nuclei being emitted from the gas rutherford recognized these because he had previously obtained them bombarding hydrogen with alpha particles and observing hydrogen nuclei in the products rutherford concluded that the hydrogen nuclei emerged from the nuclei of the nitrogen atoms themselves in effect he had split a nitrogen
from his own work and the work of his students bohr and henry moseley rutherford knew that the positive charge of any atom could always be equated to that of an integer number of hydrogen nuclei this coupled with the atomic mass of many elements being roughly equivalent to an integer number of hydrogen atoms - then assumed to be the lightest particles - led him to conclude that hydrogen nuclei were singular particles and a basic constituent of all atomic nuclei he named such particles protons further experimentation by rutherford found that the nuclear mass of most atoms exceeded that of the protons it possessed he speculated that this surplus mass was composed of previously-unknown neutrally charged particles which were tentatively dubbed neutrons
in 1928 walter bothe observed that beryllium emitted a highly penetrating electrically neutral radiation when bombarded with alpha particles it was later discovered that this radiation could knock hydrogen atoms out of paraffin wax initially it was thought to be high-energy gamma radiation since gamma radiation had a similar effect on electrons in metals but james chadwick found that the ionization effect was too strong for it to be due to electromagnetic radiation so long as energy and momentum were conserved in the interaction in 1932 chadwick exposed various elements such as hydrogen and nitrogen to the mysterious beryllium radiation and by measuring the energies of the recoiling charged particles he deduced that the radiation was actually composed of electrically neutral particles which could not be massless like the gamma ray but instead were required to have a mass similar to that of a proton chadwick now claimed these particles as rutherfords neutrons for his discovery of the neutron chadwick received the nobel prize in 1935


 quantum physical models of the atom 

in 1924 louis de broglie proposed that all moving particles—particularly subatomic particles such as electrons—exhibit a degree of wave-like behavior erwin schrödinger fascinated by this idea explored whether or not the movement of an electron in an atom could be better explained as a wave rather than as a particle schrödingers equation published in 1926 describes an electron as a wavefunction instead of as a point particle this approach elegantly predicted many of the spectral phenomena that bohrs model failed to explain although this concept was mathematically convenient it was difficult to visualize and faced opposition one of its critics max born proposed instead that schrödingers wavefunction described not the electron but rather all its possible states and thus could be used to calculate the probability of finding an electron at any given location around the nucleus this reconciled the two opposing theories of particle versus wave electrons and the idea of wave–particle duality was introduced this theory stated that the electron may exhibit the properties of both a wave and a particle for example it can be refracted like a wave and has mass like a particle
a consequence of describing electrons as waveforms is that it is mathematically impossible to simultaneously derive the position and momentum of an electron this became known as the heisenberg uncertainty principle after the theoretical physicist werner heisenberg who first described it and published it in 1927 this invalidated bohrs model with its neat clearly defined circular orbits the modern model of the atom describes the positions of electrons in an atom in terms of probabilities an electron can potentially be found at any distance from the nucleus but depending on its energy level exists more frequently in certain regions around the nucleus than others this pattern is referred to as its atomic orbital the orbitals come in a variety of shapes-sphere dumbbell torus etc-with the nucleus in the middle
