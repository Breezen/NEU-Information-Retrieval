alexis charles henri clérel viscount de tocqueville  french alɛgzi ʃaʁl ɑ̃ʁi kleʁɛl də tɔkvil 29 july 1805 – 16 april 1859 was a french diplomat political scientist and historian he was best known for his works democracy in america appearing in two volumes 1835 and 1840 and the old regime and the revolution 1856 in both he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals as well as their relationship to the market and state in western societies democracy in america was published after tocquevilles travels in the united states and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science
tocqueville was active in french politics first under the july monarchy 1830–48 and then during the second republic 1849–51 which succeeded the february 1848 revolution he retired from political life after louis napoléon bonapartes 2 december 1851 coup and thereafter began work on the old regime and the revolution
he argued the importance of the french revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the french state which had begun under king louis xiv the failure of the revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract enlightenment ideals tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government but he was skeptical of the extremes of democracy


 life 
alexis de tocqueville came from an old norman aristocratic family with ancestors who participated in the battle of hastings in 1066 his parents hervé louis françois jean bonaventure clérel comte de tocqueville an officer of the constitutional guard of king louis xvi and louise madeleine le peletier de rosanbo narrowly escaped the guillotine due to the fall of robespierre in 1794
under the bourbon restoration tocquevilles father became a noble peer and prefect tocqueville attended the lycée fabert in metz

tocqueville who despised the july monarchy 1830–1848 began his political career in 1839 from 1839 to 1851 he served as deputy of the manche department valognes in parliament he defended abolitionist views and upheld free trade while supporting the colonisation of algeria carried on by louis-philippes regime tocqueville was also elected general counsellor of the manche in 1842 and became the president of the departments conseil général between 1849 and 1851 according to one account tocquevilles political position became untenable during this time in the sense that he was mistrusted by both the left and right and was looking for an excuse to leave france


 travels 
in 1831 he obtained from the july monarchy a mission to examine prisons and penitentiaries in america and proceeded there with his lifelong friend gustave de beaumont while tocqueville did visit some prisons he traveled widely in america and took extensive notes about his observations and reflections he returned within nine months and published a report but the real result of his tour was de la démocratie en amerique which appeared in 1835 beaumont also wrote an account of their travels in jacksonian america marie or slavery in the united states 1835 during this trip he made a side trip to lower canada to montreal and quebec city from mid august to early september 1831
apart from america tocqueville also made an observational tour of england producing memoir on pauperism in 1841 and 1846 he traveled to algeria his first travel inspired his travail sur lalgérie in which he criticized the french model of colonisation which was based on an assimilationist view preferring instead the british model of indirect rule which avoided mixing different populations together he went as far as openly advocating racial segregation between the european colonists and the arabs through the implementation of two different legislative systems a half century before implementation of the 1881 indigenous code based on religion
in 1835 tocqueville made a journey through ireland his observations provide one of the best pictures of how ireland stood before the great famine 1845–49 the observations chronicle the growing catholic middle-class and the appalling conditions in which most catholic tenant farmers lived tocqueville made clear both his libertarian sympathies and his affinity for his irish co-religionists
after the fall of the july monarchy during the february 1848 revolution tocqueville was elected a member of the constituent assembly of 1848 where he became a member of the commission charged with the drafting of the new constitution of the second republic 1848–51 he defended bicameralism the wisdom of two parliamentary chambers and the election of the president of the republic by universal suffrage as the countryside was thought to be more conservative than the labouring population of paris universal suffrage was conceived as a means to counteract the revolutionary spirit of paris
during the second republic tocqueville sided with the parti de lordre against the socialists a few days after the february insurrection he believed that a violent clash between the parisian workers population led by socialists agitating in favor of a democratic and social republic and the conservatives which included the aristocracy and the rural population was inescapable as tocqueville had foreseen these social tensions eventually exploded during the june days uprising of 1848
led by general cavaignac the suppression was supported by tocqueville who advocated the regularization of the state of siege declared by cavaignac and other measures promoting suspension of the constitutional order between may and september tocqueville participated in the constitutional commission which wrote the new constitution his proposals underlined the importance of his american experience as his amendment about the president and his reelection


 minister of foreign affairs 1849 

a supporter of cavaignac and of the parti de lordre tocqueville however accepted an invitation to enter odilon barrots government as minister of foreign affairs from 3 june to 31 october 1849 there during the troubled days of june 1849 he pleaded with jules dufaure interior minister for the reestablishment of the state of siege in the capital and approved the arrest of demonstrators tocqueville who since february 1848 had supported laws restricting political freedoms approved the two laws voted immediately after the june 1849 days which restricted the liberty of clubs and freedom of the press
this active support in favor of laws restricting political freedoms stands in contrast of his defense of freedoms in democracy in america according to tocqueville he favored order as the sine qua non for the conduct of serious politics he hoped to bring the kind of stability to french political life that would permit the steady growth of liberty unimpeded by the regular rumblings of the earthquakes of revolutionary change″
tocqueville had supported cavaignac against louis napoléon bonaparte for the presidential election of 1848 opposed to louis napoléons 2 december 1851 coup which followed his election tocqueville was among the deputies who gathered at the 10th arrondissement of paris in an attempt to resist the coup and have napoleon iii judged for high treason as he had violated the constitutional limit on terms of office detained at vincennes and then released tocqueville who supported the restoration of the bourbons against napoleon iiis second empire 1851–71 quit political life and retreated to his castle château de tocqueville
against this image of tocqueville biographer joseph epstein has concluded tocqueville could never bring himself to serve a man he considered a usurper and despot he fought as best he could for the political liberty in which he so ardently believed – had given it in all thirteen years of his life  he would spend the days remaining to him fighting the same fight but conducting it now from libraries archives and his own desk there he began the draft of lancien régime et la révolution publishing the first tome in 1856 but leaving the second one unfinished


 death 1859 
a longtime sufferer from bouts of tuberculosis tocqueville would eventually succumb to the disease on 16 april 1859 he was buried in the tocqueville cemetery in normandy
tocquevilles professed religion was roman catholicism he saw religion as being compatible with both equality and individualism and felt that religion would be strongest when separated from politics


 democracy in america 

in democracy in america published in 1835 tocqueville wrote of the new world and its burgeoning democratic order observing from the perspective of a detached social scientist tocqueville wrote of his travels through america in the early 19th century when the market revolution western expansion and jacksonian democracy were radically transforming the fabric of american life
one purpose of writing democracy in america according to joshua kaplan was to help the people of france get a better understanding of their position between a fading aristocratic order and an emerging democratic order and to help them sort out the confusion tocqueville saw democracy as an equation that balanced liberty and equality concern for the individual as well as for the community
tocqueville was an ardent supporter of liberty i have a passionate love for liberty law and respect for rights he wrote i am neither of the revolutionary party nor of the conservativeliberty is my foremost passion he wrote of political consequences of the social state of the anglo-americans by saying but one also finds in the human heart a depraved taste for equality which impels the weak to want to bring the strong down to their level and which reduces men to preferring equality in servitude to inequality in freedom
the above is often misquoted as a slavery quote because of previous translations of the french text the most recent translation from arthur goldhammer in 2004 translates the meaning to be as stated above examples of misquoted sources are numerous on the internet the text does not contain the words americans were so enamored by equality anywhere
his view on government reflects his belief in liberty and the need for individuals to be able to act freely while respecting others rights of centralized government he wrote that it excels in preventing not doing
he continues to comment on equality by saying furthermore when citizens are all almost equal it becomes difficult for them to defend their independence against the aggressions of power as none of them is strong enough to fight alone with advantage the only guarantee of liberty is for everyone to combine forces but such a combination is not always in evidence
tocqueville explicitly cites inequality as being incentive for poor to become rich and notes that it is not often that two generations within a family maintain success and that it is inheritance laws that split and eventually break apart someones estate that cause a constant cycle of churn between the poor and rich thereby over generations making the poor rich and rich poor he cites protective laws in france at the time that protected an estate from being split apart among heirs thereby preserving wealth and preventing a churn of wealth such as was perceived by him in 1835 within the united states of america


 on civil and political society and the individual 
tocquevilles main purpose was to analyze the functioning of political society and various forms of political associations although he brought some reflections on civil society too and relations between political and civil society for tocqueville as for hegel and marx civil society was a sphere of private entrepreneurship and civilian affairs regulated by civil code as a critic of individualism tocqueville thought that through associating the coming together of people for mutual purpose both in public and private americans are able to overcome selfish desires thus making both a self-conscious and active political society and a vibrant civil society functioning according to political and civil laws of the state
according to political scientist joshua kaplan tocqueville did not originate the concept of individualism instead he changed its meaning and saw it as a calm and considered feeling which deposes each citizen to isolate himself from the mass of his fellows and to withdraw into the circle of family and friends  with this little society formed to his taste he gladly leaves the greater society to look for itself while tocqueville saw egotism and selfishness as vices he saw individualism as not a failure of feeling but as a way of thinking about things which could have either positive consequences such as a willingness to work together or negative consequences such as isolation and that individualism could be remedied by improved understanding
when individualism was a positive force and prompted people to work together for common purposes and seen as self-interest properly understood then it helped to counterbalance the danger of the tyranny of the majority since people could take control over their own lives without government aid according to kaplan americans have a difficult time accepting tocquevilles criticism of the stifling intellectual effect of the omnipotence of the majority and that americans tend to deny that there is a problem in this regard
others such as the catholic writer daniel schwindt disagree with kaplans interpretation arguing instead that tocqueville saw individualism as just another form of egotism and not an improvement over it to make his case schwindt provides citations such as the following

egoism springs from a blind instinct individualism from wrong-headed thinking rather than from depraved feelings it originates as much from defects of intelligence as from the mistakes of the heart egoism blights the seeds of every virtue individualism at first dries up only the source of public virtue in the longer term it attacks and destroys all the others and will finally merge with egoism


 on democracy and new forms of tyranny 
tocqueville warned that modern democracy may be adept at inventing new forms of tyranny because radical equality could lead to the materialism of an expanding bourgeoisie and to the selfishness of individualism in such conditions we might become so enamored with a relaxed love of present enjoyments that we lose interest in the future of our descendantsand meekly allow ourselves to be led in ignorance by a despotic force all the more powerful because it does not resemble one wrote the new yorkers james wood tocqueville worried that if despotism were to take root in a modern democracy it would be a much more dangerous version than the oppression under the roman emperors or tyrants of the past who could only exert a pernicious influence on a small group of people at a time
in contrast a despotism under a democracy could see a multitude of men uniformly alike equal constantly circling for petty pleasures unaware of fellow citizens and subject to the will of a powerful state which exerted an immense protective power tocqueville compared a potentially despotic democratic government to a protective parent who wants to keep its citizens children as perpetual children and which doesnt break mens wills but rather guides it and presides over people in the same way as a shepherd looking after a flock of timid animals


 on american social contract 
tocquevilles penetrating analysis sought to understand the peculiar nature of american political life in describing the american he agreed with thinkers such as aristotle and montesquieu that the balance of property determined the balance of political power but his conclusions after that differed radically from those of his predecessors tocqueville tried to understand why america was so different from europe in the last throes of aristocracy america in contrast to the aristocratic ethic was a society where hard work and money-making was the dominant ethic where the common man enjoyed a level of dignity which was unprecedented where commoners never deferred to elites and where what he described as crass individualism and market capitalism had taken root to an extraordinary degree
tocqueville writes among a democratic people where there is no hereditary wealth every man works to earn a living labor is held in honor the prejudice is not against but in its favor

tocqueville asserted that the values that had triumphed in the north and were present in the south had begun to suffocate old-world ethics and social arrangements legislatures abolished primogeniture and entails resulting in more widely distributed land holdings this was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child usually a man inherited the estate which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation
in america in contrast landed elites were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of primogeniture which meant that as time went by large estates became broken up within a few generations which in turn made the children more equal overall it was not always a negative development according to joshua kaplans interpretation of tocqueville since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern overall in the new democracies hereditary fortunes became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living
this rapidly democratizing society as tocqueville understood it had a population devoted to middling values which wanted to amass through hard work vast fortunes in tocquevilles mind this explained why america was so different from europe in europe he claimed nobody cared about making money the lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth while the upper classes found it crass vulgar and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted at the same time in america workers would see people fashioned in exquisite attire and merely proclaim that through hard work they too would soon possess the fortune necessary to enjoy such luxuries
despite maintaining with aristotle montesquieu and others that the balance of property determined the balance of power tocqueville argued that as america showed equitable property holdings did not ensure the rule of the best men in fact it did quite the opposite the widespread relatively equitable property ownership which distinguished the us and determined its mores and values also explained why the us masses held elites in such contempt


 on majority rule and mediocrity 
beyond the eradication of old-world aristocracy ordinary americans also refused to defer to those possessing as tocqueville put it superior talent and intelligence and these natural elites could not enjoy much share in political power as a result ordinary americans enjoyed too much power claimed too great a voice in the public sphere to defer to intellectual superiors this culture promoted a relatively pronounced equality tocqueville argued but the same mores and opinions that ensured such equality also promoted mediocrity those who possessed true virtue and talent were left with limited choices
tocqueville said that those with the most education and intelligence were left with two choices they could join limited intellectual circles to explore the weighty and complex problems facing society or they could use their superior talents to amass vast fortunes in the private sector tocqueville wrote that he did not know of any country where there was less independence of mind and true freedom of discussion than in america
he blamed the omnipotence of majority rule as a chief factor in stifling thinking the majority has enclosed thought within a formidable fence a writer is free inside that area but woe to the man who goes beyond it not that he stands in fear of an inquisition but he must face all kinds of unpleasantness in every day persecution a career in politics is closed to him for he has offended the only power that holds the keys tocqueville in contrast to previous political thinkers argued that a serious problem in political life was not that people were too strong but that people were too weak and felt powerless the danger is that people felt swept up in something that they could not control according to kaplans interpretation of tocqueville


 on us slavery blacks and indians 
uniquely positioned at a crossroads in american history tocquevilles democracy in america attempted to capture the essence of american culture and values though a supporter of colonialism tocqueville could clearly perceive the evils that black people and natives had been subjected to in america tocqueville devoted the last chapter of the first volume of democracy in america to the question while his travel companion gustave de beaumont wholly focused on slavery and its fallouts for the american nation in marie or slavery in america tocqueville notes that among the races that exist in america

the first who attracts the eye the first in enlightenment in power and in happiness is the white man the european man par excellence below him appear the negro and the indian these two unfortunate races have neither birth nor face nor language nor mores in common only their misfortunes look alike both occupy an equally inferior position in the country that they inhabit both experience the effects of tyranny and if their miseries are different they can accuse the same author for them

tocqueville contrasted the settlers of virginia with the middle-class religious puritans who founded new england and analyzed the debasing influence of slavery

the men sent to virginia were seekers of gold adventurers without resources and without character whose turbulent and restless spirit endangered the infant colony  artisans and agriculturalists arrived afterwardshardly in any respect above the level of the inferior classes in england no lofty views no spiritual conception presided over the foundation of these new settlements the colony was scarcely established when slavery was introduced this was the capital fact which was to exercise an immense influence on the character the laws and the whole future of the south slaverydishonors labor it introduces idleness into society and with idleness ignorance and pride luxury and distress it enervates the powers of the mind and benumbs the activity of man on this same english foundation there developed in the north very different characteristics

tocqueville concluded that removal of the negro population from america could not resolve the problem as he writes at the end of the first democracy

if the colony of liberia were able to receive thousands of new inhabitants every year and if the negroes were in a state to be sent thither with advantage if the union were to supply the society with annual subsidies and to transport the negroes to africa in government vessels it would still be unable to counterpoise the natural increase of population among the blacks and as it could not remove as many men in a year as are born upon its territory within that time it could not prevent the growth of the evil which is daily increasing in the states the negro race will never leave those shores of the american continent to which it was brought by the passions and the vices of europeans and it will not disappear from the new world as long as it continues to exist the inhabitants of the united states may retard the calamities which they apprehend but they cannot now destroy their efficient cause

in 1855 he wrote the following text published by maria weston chapman in the liberty bell testimony against slavery

i do not think it is for me a foreigner to indicate to the united states the time the measures or the men by whom slavery shall be abolished
still as the persevering enemy of despotism everywhere and under all its forms i am pained and astonished by the fact that the freest people in the world is at the present time almost the only one among civilized and christian nations which yet maintains personal servitude and this while serfdom itself is about disappearing where it has not already disappeared from the most degraded nations of europe
an old and sincere friend of america i am uneasy at seeing slavery retard her progress tarnish her glory furnish arms to her detractors compromise the future career of the union which is the guaranty of her safety and greatness and point out beforehand to her to all her enemies the spot where they are to strike as a man too i am moved at the spectacle of mans degradation by man and i hope to see the day when the law will grant equal civil liberty to all the inhabitants of the same empire as god accords the freedom of the will without distinction to the dwellers upon earth


 on policies of assimilation 
according to tocqueville assimilation of black people would be almost impossible and this was already being demonstrated in the northern states as tocqueville predicted formal freedom and equality and segregation would become this populations reality after the civil war and during reconstruction – as would the bumpy road to true integration of black people
assimilation however was the best solution for native americans and since they were too proud to assimilate they would inevitably become extinct displacement was another part of americas indian policy both populations were undemocratic or without the qualities intellectual and otherwise needed to live in a democracy tocqueville shared many views on assimilation and segregation of his and the coming epochs but he opposed arthur de gobineaus theories as found in the inequality of human races 1853–55


 on the us and russia as future global powers 
in his democracy in america tocqueville also forecast the preeminence of the united states and russia as the two main global powers in his book he stated
there are now two great nations in the world which starting from different points seem to be advancing toward the same goal the russians and the anglo-americans each seems called by some secret design of providence one day to hold in its hands the destinies of half the world


 on civil jury service 
de tocqueville believed that the american jury system was particularly important in educating citizens in self-government and rule of law he often expressed how the civil jury system was one of the most effective showcases of democracy because it connected citizens with the true spirit of the justice system in his 1835 treatise democracy in america he explained
the jury and more especially the civil jury serves to communicate the spirit of the judges to the minds of all the citizens and this spirit with the habits which attend it is the soundest preparation for free institutions    it invests each citizen with a kind of magistracy it makes them all feel the duties which they are bound to discharge toward society and the part which they take in the government 
tocqueville believed that jury service not only benefited the society as a whole but enhanced jurors’ qualities as citizens because of the jury system they were better informed about the rule of law and they were more closely connected to the state thus quite independently of what the jury contributed to dispute resolution participation on the jury had salutary effects on the jurors themselves 


 1841 discourse on the conquest of algeria 
french historian of colonialism olivier lecour grandmaison has underlined how tocqueville as well as michelet used the term extermination to describe what was happening during the colonization of western united states and the indian removal period tocqueville thus expressed himself in 1841 concerning the conquest of algeria

as far as i am concerned i came back from africa with the pathetic notion that at present in our way of waging war we are far more barbaric than the arabs themselves these days they represent civilization we do not this way of waging war seems to me as stupid as it is cruel it can only be found in the head of a coarse and brutal soldier indeed it was pointless to replace the turks only to reproduce what the world rightly found so hateful in them this even for the sake of interest is more noxious than useful for as another officer was telling me if our sole aim is to equal the turks in fact we shall be in a far lower position than theirs barbarians for barbarians the turks will always outdo us because they are muslim barbarians
in france i have often heard men i respect but do not approve of deplore that crops should be burnt and granaries emptied and finally that unarmed men women and children should be seized in my view these are unfortunate circumstances that any people wishing to wage war against the arabs must accept i think that all the means available to wreck tribes must be used barring those that the human kind and the right of nations condemn i personally believe that the laws of war enable us to ravage the country and that we must do so either by destroying the crops at harvest time or any time by making fast forays also known as raids the aim of which it to get hold of men or flocks

whatever the case we may say in a general manner that all political freedoms must be suspended in algeria

tocqueville thought the conquest of algeria was important for two reasons first his understanding of the international situation and frances position in the world and second changes in french society tocqueville believed that war and colonization would restore national pride threatened he believed by the gradual softening of social mores in the middle classes their taste for material pleasures was spreading to the whole of society giving it an example of weakness and egotism
applauding the methods of general bugeaud tocqueville went so far to claim that war in africa is a science everyone is familiar with its rules and everyone can apply those rules with almost complete certainty of success one of the greatest services that field marshal bugeaud has rendered his country is to have spread perfected and made everyone aware of this new science
tocqueville advocated racial segregation in algeria with two distinct legislations one for european colonists and one for the arab population such a two-tier arrangement would be fully realised with the 1870 crémieux decree and the indigenousness code which extended french citizenship to european settlers and algerian jews whereas muslim algerians would be governed by muslim law and restricted to a second-class citizenship


 tocquevilles opposition to the invasion of kabylie 
in opposition to olivier le cour grandmaison jean-louis benoît claimed that given the extent of racial prejudices during the colonization of algeria tocqueville was one of its most moderate supporters benoît claimed that it was wrong to assume tocqueville was a supporter of bugeaud despite his 1841 apologetic discourse it seems that tocqueville modified his views after his second visit to algeria in 1846 he criticized bugeauds desire to invade kabylie in an 1847 speech to the assembly
although tocqueville had favoured retention of distinct traditional law administrators schools etc for arabs who had come under french control he judged the berber tribes of kabylie in his second of two letters on algeria 1837 as savages not suited for this arrangement they would best be managed he argued not by force of arms but by the pacifying influences of commerce and cultural interaction
tocquevilles views on the matter were complex even though in his 1841 report on algeria he applauded bugeaud for making war in a way that defeated abd-el-kaders resistance he had advocated in the two letters that the french military advance leave kabylie undisturbed and in subsequent speeches and writings he continued to oppose intrusion into kabylie
in the debate about the 1846 extraordinary funds tocqueville denounced bugeauds conduct of military operations and succeeded in convincing the assembly not to vote funds in support of bugeauds military columns tocqueville considered bugeauds plan to invade kabylie despite the opposition of the assembly as a seditious act in the face of which the government was opting for cowardice


 report on algeria 1847 
in his 1847 report on algeria tocqueville declared that europe should avoid making the same mistake they made with the european colonization of the americas in order to avoid the bloody consequences more particularly he reminds his countrymen of a solemn caution whereby he warns them that if the methods used towards the algerian people remain unchanged colonization will end in a blood bath
tocqueville includes in his report on algeria that the fate of their soldiers and finances depended on how the french government treats the various native populations of algeria including the various arab tribes independent kabyles living in the atlas mountains and the powerful political leader abd-el-kader in his various letters and essays on algeria tocqueville discusses contrasting strategies by which a european country can approach imperialism in particular the author differentiates between what he terms dominance and a particular version of colonization
the latter stresses the obtainment and protection of land and passageways that promise commercial wealth in the case of algeria the port of algiers and the control over the strait of gibraltar were considered by tocqueville to be particularly valuable direct control of the political operations of the entirety of algeria however was not thus the author stresses domination over only certain points of political influence as a means to colonization of commercially valuable areas
tocqueville argued that domination via violent means though unpleasant is necessary for colonization and justified by the laws of war such laws are not discussed in detail however given that the goal of the french mission in algeria was to obtain commercial and military interest as opposed to self-defense it can be deduced that tocqueville would not concur with just war theorys jus ad bellum criteria of just cause further given that tocqueville approved of the use of force to eliminate civilian housing in enemy territory his approach does not accord with just war theorys jus in bello criteria of proportionality and discrimination


 the old regime and the revolution 

in 1856 tocqueville published the old regime and the revolution the book analyzes french society before the french revolution—the so-called ancien régime—and investigates the forces that caused the revolution


 references in popular literature 
tocqueville was quoted in several chapters of toby youngs memoirs how to lose friends and alienate people to explain his observation of widespread homogeneity of thought even amongst intellectual elites at harvard university during his time spent there he is frequently quoted and studied in american history classes tocqueville is the inspiration for australian novelist peter carey in his 2009 novel parrot and olivier in america
