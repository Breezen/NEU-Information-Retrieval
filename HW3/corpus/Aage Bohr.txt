aage niels bohr danish ˈɔːwə ˌnels ˈboɐ̯ˀ  listen 19 june 1922 – 8 september 2009 was a danish nuclear physicist who shared the nobel prize in physics in 1975 with ben mottelson and james rainwater for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection starting from rainwaters concept of an irregular-shaped liquid drop model of the nucleus bohr and mottelson developed a detailed theory that was in close agreement with experiments since his father niels bohr had won the prize in 1922 he and his father were one of the six pairs of fathers and sons who have both won the nobel prize and one of the four pairs who have both won the nobel prize in physics


 early life 
aage niels bohr was born in copenhagen on 19 june 1922 the fourth of six sons of the physicist niels bohr and his wife margrethe bohr née nørlund his oldest brother christian died in a boating accident in 1934 and his youngest harald from childhood meningitis of the others hans became a physician erik a chemical engineer and ernest a lawyer and an olympic athlete who played field hockey for denmark at the 1948 summer olympics in london the family lived at the institute of theoretical physics at the university of copenhagen now known as the niels bohr institute where he grew up surrounded by physicists who were working with his father such as hans kramers oskar klein yoshio nishina wolfgang pauli and werner heisenberg in 1932 the family moved to the carlsberg æresbolig a mansion donated by carl jacobsen the heir to carlsberg breweries to be used as an honorary residence by the dane who had made the most prominent contribution to science literature or the arts
bohr went to high school at sortedam gymnasium in copenhagen in 1940 shortly after the german occupation of denmark in april he entered the university of copenhagen where he studied physics he assisted his father helping draft correspondence and articles related to epistemology and physics in september 1943 word reached his family that the nazis considered them to be jewish because aages grandmother ellen adler bohr had been jewish and that they therefore were in danger of being arrested the danish resistance helped the family escape by sea to sweden bohr arrived there in october 1943 and then flew to britain on a de havilland mosquito operated by british overseas airways corporation the mosquitoes were unarmed high-speed bomber aircraft that had been converted to carry small valuable cargoes or important passengers by flying at high speed and high altitude they could cross german-occupied norway and yet avoid german fighters bohr equipped with parachute flying suit and oxygen mask spent the three-hour flight lying on a mattress in the aircrafts bomb bay
on arrival in london bohr rejoined his father who had flown to britain the week before he officially became a junior researcher at the department of scientific and industrial research but actually served as personal assistant and secretary to his father the two worked on tube alloys the british atomic bomb project on 30 december 1943 they made the first of a number of visits to the united states where his father was a consultant to the manhattan project due to his fathers fame they were given false names bohr became james baker and his father nicholas baker in 1945 the director of the los alamos laboratory robert oppenheimer asked them to review the design of the modulated neutron initiator they reported that it would work that they had reached this conclusion put enrico fermis concerns about the viability of the design to rest the initiators performed flawlessly in the bombs used in the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945


 career 
in august 1945 with the war ended bohr returned to denmark where he resumed his university education graduating with a masters degree in 1946 with a thesis concerned with some aspects of atomic stopping power problems in early 1948 bohr became a member of the institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey while paying a visit to columbia university he met isidor isaac rabi who sparked in him an interest in recent discoveries related to the hyperfine structure of deuterium this led to bohr becoming a visiting fellow at columbia from january 1949 to august 1950 while in the united states bohr married marietta soffer on 11 march 1950 they had three children vilhelm tomas and margrethe
by the late 1940s it was known that the properties of atomic nuclei could not be explained by the then-current models such as the liquid drop model developed by niels bohr amongst others the shell model developed in 1949 by maria goeppert-mayer and others allowed some additional features to be explained in particular the so-called magic numbers however there were also properties that could not be explained including the non-spherical distribution of charge in certain nuclei in a 1950 paper james rainwater of columbia university suggested a variant of the drop model of the nucleus that could explain a non-spherical charge distribution rainwaters model postulated a nucleus like a balloon with balls inside that distort the surface as they move about he discussed the idea with bohr who was visiting columbia at the time and had independently conceived the same idea and had about a month after rainwaters submission submitted for publication a paper that discussed the same problem but along more general lines bohr imagined a rotating irregular-shaped nucleus with a form of surface tension bohr developed the idea further in 1951 publishing a paper that comprehensively treated the relationship between oscillations of the surface of the nucleus and the movement of the individual nucleons
upon his return to copenhagen in 1950 bohr began working with ben mottelson to compare the theoretical work with experimental data in three papers that were published in 1952 and 1953 bohr and mottelson demonstrated close agreement between theory and experiment for example showing that the energy levels of certain nuclei could be described by a rotation spectrum they were thereby able to reconcile the shell model with rainwaters concept this work stimulated many new theoretical and experimental studies bohr mottelson and rainwater were jointly awarded the 1975 nobel prize in physics for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection because his father had been awarded the prize in 1922 bohr became one of only four pairs of fathers and sons to win the nobel prize in physics he married marietta soffer in 1950 they had two sons vilhelm and tomas and a daughter margrethe
only after doing his nobel prize-winning research did bohr receive his doctorate from the university of copenhagen in 1954 writing his thesis on rotational states of atomic nuclei bohr became a professor at the university of copenhagen in 1956 and following his fathers death in 1962 succeeded him as director of the niels bohr institute a position he held until 1970 he remained active there until he retired in 1992 he was also a member of the board of the nordic institute for theoretical physics nordita from its inception in 1957 and was its director from 1975 to 1981 in addition to the nobel prize he won the dannie heineman prize for mathematical physics in 1960 the atoms for peace award in 1969 hc ørsted medal in 1970 rutherford medal and prize in 1972 john price wetherill medal in 1974 and the ole rømer medal in 1976 bohr and mottelson continued to work together publishing a two-volume monograph nuclear structure the first volume single-particle motion appeared in 1969 the second nuclear deformations in 1975
in 1972 he was awarded an honorary degree doctor philos honoris causa at the norwegian institute of technology later part of norwegian university of science and technology
in 1981 bohr became a founding member of the world cultural council
his wife marietta died on 2 october 1978 in 1981 he married bente scharff meyer his son tomas bohr is a professor of physics at the technical university of denmark working in the area of fluid dynamics aage bohr died in copenhagen on 9 september 2009 he was survived by his second wife and children
