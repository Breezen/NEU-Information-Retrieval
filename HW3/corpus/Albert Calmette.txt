 research on tuberculosis 

calmettes main scientific work which was to bring him worldwide fame and his name permanently attached to the history of medicine was the attempt to develop a vaccine against tuberculosis which at the time was a major cause of death the german microbiologist robert koch had discovered in 1882 that the tubercle bacillus mycobacterium tuberculosis was its pathogenic agent and louis pasteur became interested in it too in 1906 a veterinarian and immunologist camille guérin had established that immunity against tuberculosis was associated with the living tubercle bacilli in the blood using pasteurs approach calmette investigated how immunity would develop in response to attenuated bovine bacilli injected in animals this preparation received the name of its two discoverers bacillum calmette-guérin or bcg for short attenuation was achieved by cultivating them in a bile-containing substrate based on idea given by a norwegian researcher kristian feyer andvord 1855–1934 from 1908 to 1921 guérin and calmette strived to produce less and less virulent strains of the bacillus by transferring them to successive cultures finally in 1921 they used bcg to successfully vaccine newborn infants in the charité in paris
the vaccination program however suffered a serious setback when 72 vaccinated children developed tuberculosis in 1930 in lübeck germany due to a contamination of some batches in germany mass vaccination of children was reinstated in many countries after 1932 when new and safer production techniques were implemented notwithstanding calmette was deeply shaken by the event dying one year later in paris
