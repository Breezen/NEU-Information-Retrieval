a total solar eclipse occurred on march 28–29 2006 a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between earth and the sun thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the sun for a viewer on earth a total solar eclipse occurs when the moons apparent diameter is larger than the suns blocking all direct sunlight turning day into darkness totality occurs in a narrow path across earths surface with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide it was visible from a narrow corridor which traversed half the earth the magnitude that is the ratio between the apparent sizes of the moon and that of the sun was 1.052 and it was part of saros 139


 visibility 

the path of totality of the moons shadow began at sunrise in brazil and extended across the atlantic to africa traveling across ghana the southeastern tip of ivory coast togo benin nigeria niger chad libya and a small corner of northwest egypt from there across the mediterranean sea to greece kastellórizo and turkey then across the black sea via georgia russia and kazakhstan to western mongolia where it ended at sunset a partial eclipse was seen from the much broader path of the moons penumbra including the northern two-thirds of africa the whole of europe and central asia


 observations 
people around the world gathered in areas where the eclipse was visible to view the event the manchester astronomical society the malaysian space agency the astronomical society of the pacific as well as dozens of tour groups met at the apollo temple and the theater in side turkey the san francisco exploratorium featured a live webcast from the site where thousands of observers were seated in the ancient roman-style theater
almost all actively visited areas in the path of totality had perfect weather many observers reported an unusually beautiful eclipse with many or all effects visible and a very nice corona despite the proximity to the solar minimum the partial phase of the eclipse was also visible from the international space station where the astronauts on board took spectacular pictures of the moons shadow on earths surface it initially appeared as though an orbit correction set for the middle of march would bring the iss into the path of totality but this correction was postponed

 satellite failure 

the satellite responsible for sky network television a new zealand pay tv company failed the day after this eclipse at around 1900 local time while sky didnt directly attribute the failure to the eclipse they said in a media release that it took longer to resolve the issue because of it but this claim was refuted by astronomers the main reason for the failure was because of an aging and increasingly faulty satellite


 related eclipses 
this solar eclipse was preceded by the penumbral lunar eclipse on march 14 2006


 solar eclipses 2004–2007 
each member in a semester series of solar eclipses repeats approximately every 177 days and 4 hours a semester at alternating nodes of the moons orbit


 saros 139 
it is a part of saros series 139 repeating every 18 years 11 days 8 hours containing 71 events the series started with partial solar eclipse on may 17 1501 it contains hybrid eclipses on august 11 1627 through december 9 1825 and total eclipses from december 21 1843 through march 26 2601 the series ends at member 71 as a partial eclipse on july 3 2763 members in the same column are one exeligmos apart and thus occur in the same geographic area
the solar eclipse of june 13 2132 will be the longest total solar eclipse since july 11 1991 at 6 minutes 55 seconds
the longest duration of totality will be produced by member 39 at 7 minutes 29 seconds on july 16 2186 this is the longest solar eclipse computed between 4000bc and 6000ad


 metonic series 
the metonic series repeats eclipses every 19 years 6939.69 days lasting about 5 cycles eclipses occur in nearly the same calendar date in addition the octon subseries repeats 1/5 of that or every 3.8 years 1387.94 days
