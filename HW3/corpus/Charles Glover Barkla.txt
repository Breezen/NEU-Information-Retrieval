charles glover barkla frs frse 7 june 1877 – 23 october 1944 was a british physicist and the winner of the nobel prize in physics in 1917 for his work in x-ray spectroscopy and related areas in the study of x-rays roentgen rays


 life 
barkla was born in widnes england to john martin barkla a secretary for the atlas chemical company and sarah glover daughter of a watchmaker
barkla studied at the liverpool institute and proceeded to liverpool university with a county council scholarship and a bibby scholarship barkla initially studied mathematics but later specialised in physics under sir oliver lodge during the absence of oliver lodge due to ill health barkla would replace him in lectures
in 1899 barkla was admitted to trinity college cambridge with an 1851 research fellowship from the royal commission for the exhibition of 1851 to work in the cavendish laboratory under the physicist j j thomson discoverer of the electron during his first two years at cambridge barkla would under the directions of thomson study the velocity of electromagnetic waves along wires of different widths and materials
after a year and a half at trinity college cambridge his love of music led him to transfer to kings college cambridge in order to sing in their chapel choir barklas baritone voice was of remarkable beauty and his solo performances would always be fully attended he completed his bachelor of arts degree in 1903 and then his master of arts degree in 1907 he married mary esther cowell in the same year with whom he would have two sons and one daughter

barkla made significant progress in developing and refining the laws of x-ray scattering x-ray spectroscopy the principles governing the transmission of x-rays through matter and especially the principles of the excitation of secondary x-rays for his discovery of the characteristic x-rays of elements barkla was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 1917 he was also awarded the hughes medal of the british royal society that same year


 personal life 
a religious man barkla was a methodist and considered his work to be part of the quest for god the creator
