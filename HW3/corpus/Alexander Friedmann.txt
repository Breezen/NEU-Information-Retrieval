alexander alexandrovich friedmann also spelled friedman or fridman russian алекса́ндр алекса́ндрович фри́дман june 16 os 4 1888 – september 16 1925 was a russian and soviet physicist and mathematician he is best known for his pioneering theory that the universe was expanding governed by a set of equations he developed now known as the friedmann equations


 early life 
alexander friedmann was born to the composer and ballet dancer alexander friedmann who was a son of a baptized jewish cantonist and the pianist ludmila ignatievna voyachek friedmann was baptized into the russian orthodox church as an infant and lived much of his life in saint petersburg
friedmann obtained his degree from st petersburg state university in 1910 and became a lecturer at saint petersburg mining institute
from his school days friedmann found an inseparable companion in jacob tamarkin who at the end of his career was one of brown universitys most distinguished mathematicians


 world war i 
friedmann fought in world war i on behalf of imperial russia as an army aviator an instructor and eventually under the revolutionary regime as the head of an airplane factory


 professorship 
friedmann in 1922 introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter belgian astronomer georges lemaître would later independently reach the same conclusion in 1927
in june 1925 he was given the job of the director of main geophysical observatory in leningrad in july 1925 he participated in a record-setting balloon flight reaching the elevation of 7,400 m 24,300 ft


 work 


 relativity 
friedmanns 1924 papers including über die möglichkeit einer welt mit konstanter negativer krümmung des raumes on the possibility of a world with constant negative curvature of space published by the german physics journal zeitschrift für physik vol 21 pp 326–332 demonstrated that he had command of all three friedmann models describing positive zero and negative curvature respectively a decade before robertson and walker published their analysis
this dynamic cosmological model of general relativity would come to form the standard for both the big bang and steady state theories friedmanns work supports both theories equally so it was not until the detection of the cosmic microwave background radiation that the steady state theory was abandoned in favor of the current favorite big bang paradigm
the classic solution of the einstein field equations that describes a homogeneous and isotropic universe is called the friedmann–lemaître–robertson–walker metric or flrw after friedmann georges lemaître howard p robertson and arthur geoffrey walker who worked on the problem in 1920s and 30s independently of friedmann


 hydrodynamics and meteorology 
in addition to general relativity friedmanns interests included hydrodynamics and meteorology


 students 
physicists george gamow vladimir fock and lev vasilievich keller were among his students


 personal life 
in 1911 he married emily tung though he later divorced her he married natalia malinina in the last years of his life they had a religious wedding ceremony though both were far from religious


 death

 named after friedmann 
the moon crater fridman is named after him


 alexander friedmann international seminar 
alexander friedmann international seminar is a periodical scientific event the objective of the meeting is to promote contacts between scientists working in the field of relativity gravitation and cosmology and related fields the first alexander friedmann international seminar on gravitation and cosmology devoted to the centenary of his birth took place in 1988
