abrikosov was born in moscow russian sfsr soviet union on june 25 1928 to a couple of physicians prof alexei ivanovich abrikosov and dr fani abrikosova née wulf he graduated from moscow state university in 1948 from 1948 to 1965 he worked at the institute for physical problems of the ussr academy of sciences where he received his phd in 1951 for the theory of thermal diffusion in plasmas and then his doctor of physical and mathematical sciences a higher doctorate degree in 1955 for a thesis on quantum electrodynamics at high energies


 career 
from 1965 to 1988 he worked at the landau institute for theoretical physics ussr academy of sciences he has been a professor at moscow state university since 1965 in addition he held tenure at the moscow institute of physics and technology from 1972 to 1976 and at the moscow institute of steel and alloys from 1976 to 1991 he served as a full member of the ussr academy of sciences from 1987 to 1991 in 1991 he became a full member of the russian academy of sciences
in two works in 1952 and 1957 abrikosov explained how magnetic flux can penetrate a class of superconductors this class of materials is known as type-ii superconductors the accompanying arrangement of magnetic flux lines is called the abrikosov vortex lattice
from 1991 until his retirement he worked at argonne national laboratory in the us state of illinois abrikosov was an argonne distinguished scientist at the condensed matter theory group in argonne’s materials science division his recent research has focused on the origins of magnetoresistance a property of some materials that change their resistance to electrical flow under the influence of a magnetic field
