archibald vivian hill  26 september 1886 – 3 june 1977 known as a v hill was an english physiologist one of the founders of the diverse disciplines of biophysics and operations research he shared the 1922 nobel prize in physiology or medicine for his elucidation of the production of heat and mechanical work in muscles


 biography 
born in bristol he was educated at blundells school and graduated from trinity college cambridge as third wrangler in the mathematics tripos before turning to physiology while still an undergraduate at trinity college he derived in 1909 what came to be known as the langmuir equation  this is closely related to michaelis-menten kinetics in this paper hills first publication he derived both the equilibrium form of the langmuir equation and also the exponential approach to equilibrium the paper written under the supervision of john newport langley is a landmark in the history of receptor theory because the context for the derivation was the binding of nicotine and curare to the receptive substance at the neuromuscular junction
hill made many exacting measurements of the heat released when skeletal muscles contract and relax a key finding was that heat is produced during contraction which requires investment of chemical energy but not during relaxation which is passive  his earliest measurements used equipment left behind by the swedish physiologist magnus blix hill measured a temperature rise of only 0.003 degrees centigrade after publication he learned that german physiologist had already reported on heat and muscle contraction and he went to germany to learn more about their work he continually improved his apparatus to make it more sensitive and to reduce the time lag between the heat released by the preparation and its recording by his thermocouple
hill is regarded along with hermann helmholtz as one of the founders of biophysics
while a student he had enrolled in the officers training course he was a crack shot in 1914 at the outbreak of world war i hill because the musketry officer of the cambridgeshire regiment the british made no effort to make use of their scientists   at the end of 1915 while home on leave he was asked by horace darwin from the ministry of munitions to come for a day to advise them on how to train anti-aircraft gunners on site hill immediately proposed a simple two mirror method to determine airplanes heights transferred to munitions he realized that the mirrors could measure where smoke shells burst and if he fit this data with the equations describing a shells flight they could provide accurate range tables for anti-aircraft guns to measure and compute he assembled a team of men too old for conscription ralph h fowler a wounded officer and lads too young for service including douglas hartree and arthur milne someone dubbed his motley group hills brigands which they proudly adopted later in the war they also worked on locating enemy planes from their sound he sped between their working sites on his beloved motorcycle at the end of the war major hill issued certificates to more than one hundred brigands he was awarded an obe
hill returned briefly to cambridge in 1919 before taking the chair in physiology at the victoria university of manchester in 1920 in succession to william stirling using himself as the subject —he ran every morning from 715 to 1030 — he showed that running a dash relies on energy stores which afterwards are replenished by increased oxygen consumption paralleling the work of german otto fritz meyerhof hill elucidated the processes whereby mechanical work is produced in muscles the two shared the 1922 nobel prize in physiology and medicine for this work 
in 1923 he succeeded ernest starling as professor of physiology at university college london a few years later becoming a royal society research professor there where he remained until retirement in 1951 in 1933 he became with lord beveridge and lord rutherford a founder member and vice-president of the academic assistance council which in 1936 became the society for the protection of science and learning by the start of the second world war the organisation had saved 900 academics 18 of whom went on to win nobel prizes from nazi persecution he prominently displayed in his laboratory a toy figure of adolf hitler with saluting arm upraised which he explained was in gratitude for all the scientists germany had expelled some of whom were now working with him  hill believed that laughter is the best detergent for nonsense 
in 1935 he served with patrick blackett and sir henry tizard on the committee that gave birth to radar he was also biological secretary of the royal society william henry bragg was president both had been frustrated by the delay in putting scientists to work in the previous war the royal society collated a list of scientists and hill represented the society at the ministry of labor when the war came hill led a campaign to liberate refugee scientists who had been interned he served as an independent member of parliament mp for cambridge university from 1940 to 1945 in 1940 he was posted to the british embassy in washington to promote war research in the still neutral united states he was authorized to swap secrets with the americans but this could not work how do you place a value on anothers secret hill saw the answer and persuaded the british to show the americans everything they were working on except for the atomic bomb the mobilization of allied scientist was one of the major successes in the war 
after the war he rebuilt his laboratory at university college and vigorously carried on research  in 1951 his advocacy was rewarded by the establishment of a biophysics department under his leadership in 1952 he became head of the british association for the advancement of science and secretary general of the international union of scientific organizations he was president of the marine biological association from 1955 to 1960 in 1967 he retired to cambridge where he gradually lost the use of his legs he died held in the greatest affection by more than a hundred scientific descendants all over the world

 blue plaque 

on 9 september 2015 an english heritage blue plaque was erected at hills former home 16 bishopswood road highgate where he had lived from 1923-1967 since then the house had been divided into flats and owned by highgate school where hill was a governor from 1929-1960 it has now been sold redeveloped and renamed as hurstbourne in hills time according to his grandson nicholas humphrey regular guests at the house included 18 exiled nobel laureates his brother-in-law the economist john maynard keynes and friends stephen hawking and sigmund freud after-dinner conversations in the drawing room would inevitably involve passionate debates about science or politics “every sunday we would have to attend a tea party at grandpa’s house and apart from entertaining some extraordinary guests he would devise some great games for us such as frog racing in the garden or looking through the lens of a dissected sheep’s eye” sir ralph kohn frs who proposed the blue plaque said “the nobel prize winner a v hill contributed vastly to our understanding of muscle physiology his work has resulted in wide-ranging application in sports medicine as an outstanding humanitarian and parliamentarian he was uncompromising in his condemnation of the nazi regime for its persecution of scientists and others a v hill played a crucial role in assisting and rescuing many refugees to continue their work in this country”
